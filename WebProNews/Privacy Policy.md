Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes while at the site. Cookies make Web-surfing easier by, among other things, saving your passwords and preferences for you. The use of cookies is an industry-standard, and you’ll find cookies at most major Web sites.

Cookies help make The iEntry Network better, by showing how and when guests use the site. Many content improvements and updates are based on such data as the total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. A cookie lets The iEntry Network remember that you’ve registered, which allows us to speed up your future activities at our sites. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information although it may enable The iEntry Network to relate a user’s use of The iEntry Network to personally-identifying information that has previously been submitted by the user if any.

You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. These cookies are sent from third-party computers and are subject to such third parties’ policies. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you’d prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies. However, it is likely that most areas of the site will not function properly if you do so.
