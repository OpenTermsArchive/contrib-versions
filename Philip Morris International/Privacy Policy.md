Who are we?
-----------

We are an affiliate member of Philip Morris International, a collective group of businesses. All affiliate members of the group are listed [here](https://pmiprivacy.com/global/en/consumer/affiliates/) along with data protection officer contact points where relevant. Please use these details if you wish to contact us.  

Our details (name, address, etc.) will have been given to you separately at the time of (or to confirm) the collection of information about you, for example, in a notice on an app or a website, or in an e-mail, containing a link to this notice.

* _‘Philip Morris International_ or _PMI_ means Philip Morris International, a leading international tobacco group. It is made up of a number of companies or “affiliates”.
* _PMI affiliates:_ Each member of the Philip Morris International group of companies is a “PMI affiliate”. “We” (or “us” or “our”) refers to the PMI affiliate that first collected information about you.
* _PMI product:_ means a product of ours or of another PMI affiliate.

How do we collect information about you?
----------------------------------------

We may collect information about you in various ways.

* You may provide us with information directly (e.g. filling in a form, making a call to us, or uploading information to us via a mobile app).
* We may collect information from a PMI electronic device, if you choose to send information to us.
* We may collect information automatically when you interact with our systems or we communicate with you (e.g. when you use a PMI app or website or, where we use technologies to observe when you receive or open e-mails or receive SMS messages).
* We may also acquire information from third parties (e.g. publicly-available information on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, or statistical information about the population in certain geographical areas).
* For example, where permitted by law, we may infer information about you from aggregated information we acquire from third parties. This may include, for example, statistical information about people in certain geographical areas.

In this notice, we refer to all the methods by which you are in contact with us as “_PMI_ _touchpoints_”. PMI touchpoints include both physical (for example, retail outlets and events, consumer contact centres), and digital (for example, apps and websites).

We may collect information that you provide directly. Typically, this will happen when you:

* sign up to be a member of our databases (including loyalty programs), which will include performing age verification (this could be, for example, in person, via app, or online);
* request information about our products, which may include age recognition (this could be computer analysis of your face via app or online);
* purchase PMI products or services at a retail outlet;
* download, or use, a PMI digital touchpoint (e.g. an app or a website);
* contact us through a touchpoint, or by e-mail, social media or telephone;
* register a device with us;
* subscribe to a PMI panel portal;
* register to receive PMI press releases, e-mail alerts, or marketing communications;
* participate in PMI surveys or (where permitted by law) PMI competitions or promotions; or
* attend an event that a PMI affiliate has organised.

We may collect information from an electronic device, if you choose to send the information to us. This may be shared with us through a direct connection to the internet, or via one of our apps that you may download.

We may collect information about you automatically. Typically, this will happen when you:

* visit an outlet that sells PMI products (for example, by collecting your data at check-out, or through sensors at the outlet that connect with mobile technology);
* attend an event that a PMI affiliate has organised (for example, through purchases at the event or through sensors at the event that connect with mobile technology);
* communicate with us (for example, through a touchpoint, or social media platforms);
* use PMI touchpoints (for example, through tracking mechanisms (such as cookies and web beacons/pixels), where we use them, that you receive when you use the PMI touchpoint or get an e-mail or SMS message from us);
* use third party websites (for example, using technology similar to that described in the bullet above, that you receive when you visit a PMI touchpoint or get an e-mail from us); or
* make public posts on social media platforms that we follow (for example, so that we can understand public opinion, or respond to requests concerning PMI products).

As mentioned above, we may collect information about you automatically through the use of cookies and similar tracking technologies (such as web beacons/pixels) that you receive when you visit digital PMI touchpoints or get an electronic message from us. The specific cookies and other mechanisms used will depend on the touchpoint in question. To learn about these mechanisms used on a PMI touchpoint, including how you can accept or refuse cookies, please see the information made available on or through that touchpoint. These mechanisms may include Google analytics cookies (see www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.)

Where permitted by law, we may acquire information about you from third parties. This may include information shared between PMI affiliates, publicly available profile information (such as your preferences and interests) on third party social media sites (such as Facebook and Twitter), marketing lists and supplementary information acquired from third party agencies.

Where permitted by law, we may infer information about you from information about you that we already have. For example, we may use aggregated information about people in certain geographical areas, that we acquire from third parties, to infer your preferences.

We may also collect information in other contexts made apparent to you at the time.

What information about you do we collect?
-----------------------------------------

We may collect various types of information about you:

* information about your orders, including information necessary to fulfil them
* information necessary to provide warranty services
* information about the referrals you make
* information you give us in forms or surveys, and similar information that you give to third parties to be transferred to us
* information about your location, where you choose to share it with us (for example, on your mobile phone)
* information about your visits to our outlets or events (or outlets or events of others with whom we work)
* information you give us in communications (e.g. calls, chats, e-mails, SMS messages) you have with contact centres
* information about your preferences and interests (including information that we infer from other information, for example from statistical information)
* information necessary to verify your age
* information generated by your electronic device (for example, IQOS), if you choose to share it with us
* information about your experiences using our products and services
* statistical information about you (for example, statistical information about people in certain geographical areas)

Information that we collect from you directly will be apparent from the context in which you provide it. For example:

* if you order a product from us through a touchpoint, you provide your name, contact, billing details, payment methods, and the products you have chosen so that we can fulfil your order;
* you may provide information on your product preferences, interests and experiences so that we can offer you products and services that will interest you, and to improve our products and services;
* if you make an appointment to see us (or someone supporting our products or services), we may collect your name and contact details;
* we may collect information that enables us to verify your age, for example a copy of an identity document or your facial image (either as a photograph or a video);
* if you have downloaded one of our apps, we may ask to use your location (even when the app is closed or not in use) for certain features. For example, the “_find my IQOS_” feature helps you find your device if lost, and it won’t work properly if you don’t share your location. We don’t keep the location data. It will be used only to allow these features and only if you agree to share this data by agreeing to the respective in-app disclosures;
* if you communicate with one of our contact centres, you may give us information, for example about your experiences using our products and services, to allow us to deal with your requests.

Information that we collect from an electronic device, if you choose to send the information to us. This may include, for a PMI electronic device, information about: (i) the device itself (such as holder serial number, charger serial number, firmware version, device errors); and (ii) use of the device (such as number of consumable items (e.g. for the IQOS device), number of cleans, battery use, puff count, and device life data (including cumulative values, and timestamps, for each of the foregoing)).

Information that we collect automatically will generally concern:

* details of your visit or call (such as time, date, and duration);
* recordings (where permitted) of your calls or visits to PMI touchpoints, which we may transcribe to text format;
* in a sales outlet or at an event (including areas in the immediate vicinity), how frequently you visit, which areas you visit and for how long, and which purchases you make;
* your use of digital PMI touchpoints (such as the pages you visit, the page from which you came, and the page to which you went when you left, search terms entered, or links clicked within the touchpoint, when you first open the touchpoint, for how long you use it, and how you interact with messages we send you or advertisements we show you); we may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (such as pixels/web beacons) to do this;
* your use of third-party websites, where the information collected will be similar to that described in the bullet above (we may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (such as pixels/web beacons) to do this);
* your mobile or desktop device and software (such as your IP address or unique device identifier (for example, mobile advertising identifier (MAID) or Android ID (SSAID)), location data (either your general location (derived from your IP address, in which case the information we have will be general, e.g. the town you are in), or your precise location (if you choose to share it with us for specified purposes, e.g. store locator)), device brand and model, the display settings of your monitor, web browser type, operating system, (some of which may be used in “digital fingerprinting” (see for what purposes we use information about you, below)) and details of any cookies (or similar technologies) that we may have stored on your device); and
* if you return your PMI electronic device to us, or bring it to one of our stores, because it’s faulty, and choose to share with us the data it holds (as above), we may extract that data from the device.

Information that we collect from third parties will generally consist of publicly available information (such as your preferences, interests and experiences), for example from public social media posts.

For what purposes do we use information about you, and on what legal basis?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this section, we describe the purposes for which we use personal information. However, this is a global notice, and where the laws of a country restrict or prohibit certain activities described in this notice, we will not use information about you for those purposes in that country.

Subject to the above, we use information about you for the following purposes:

* To comply with regulatory obligations, such as verifying your age and status as a user of our products
* To lend or sell our products to you, including fulfilling your orders, processing your payments
* To provide sales-related and product support services to you, including dealing with your inquiries and requests, and providing warranty and support services
* To market our products (where permitted by law), including administering loyalty programs and referral programs, product improvement, market research (and for the purposes of demonstrating fair practices in market research), developing marketing strategies, administering marketing campaigns, and customizing your experiences, for example at outlets that sell PMI products and at events, and the content of messages we send you or advertisements we show you
* To understand whether you are still engaged with our marketing and whether you wish to continue to receive it
* For us or our business partners to inform you of potential opportunities to get involved in marketing or promoting PMI products
* To enable you to use, and improve your experience of, PMI touchpoints and PMI electronic devices
* To support all the above, including administering your accounts, corresponding with you, managing your appointments with us or with someone supporting our products or services (for example, regarding a new product, or after-sales service), customizing your experiences of PMI touchpoints, fraud prevention (for example in the context of our promotions, competitions and surveys, to ensure that they are not taken more than once by the same person, or in the context of e-commerce to protect cardholder information), personnel training and quality control, and administration and troubleshooting
* For business analytics, statistical or scientific purposes, including improving PMI products (for data collected from PMI electronic devices, this will apply only if you have chosen to send the information to us for these purposes) and services, outlets and events, and the information that we (or our affiliates) provide to our consumers
* For other purposes that we notify you of, or will be clear from the context, at the point information about you is first collected

The legal basis for our use of information about you is one of the following (which we explain in more detail in the “find out more” section):

* compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject;
* the performance of a contract to which you are a party;
* a legitimate business interest that is not overridden by interests you have to protect the information;

where none of the above applies, or where law requires it, your consent (which we will ask for before we process the information).

Where might information about you be sent?
------------------------------------------

As with any multinational organisation, we transfer information globally to our affiliates and service providers.  Your data may therefore be transferred to other countries as part of our standard operations.  Whenever we transfer your data abroad, we will limit access to your data only to those who need to see it, process your data in accordance with our internal data protection standards, protect it appropriately and only transfer information in compliance with applicable data privacy laws.  When data is transferred, we will require the receiving party to keep your data confidential, delete it when it is no longer required and act in accordance with this privacy notice.  Accordingly, information about you may be transferred outside of your jurisdiction.  For example, if you live in the EU, EEA, UK, Australia or Japan, your data may be processed in another country.

When using information as described in this notice, information about you may be transferred either within or outside the country or territory where it was collected, including to a country or territory that may not have equivalent data protection standards.

For example, we and other PMI affiliates within the EU and EEA may transfer personal information to PMI affiliates, or to their service providers, outside the EU and EEA. In all such cases, the transfer will be:

* on the basis of a [European Commission adequacy decision](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en#dataprotectionincountriesoutsidetheeu);
* subject to appropriate safeguards, for example the [EU Standard Contractual Clauses](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en) or [binding corporate rules](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/binding-corporate-rules-bcr_en); or
* with your consent or as necessary to discharge obligations under a contract between you and us (or the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken at your request) or for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in your interest between us and a third party, such as in relation to travel arrangements.

For transfers from the UK, in accordance with the UK GDPR and guidance of the Information Commissioner’s Office.

In all cases, appropriate security measures for the protection of personal information will be applied in those countries or territories, in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

Our service providers are located in many countries throughout the world, including in particular the EEA, Switzerland, the USA, Canada, India, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Australia.

How do we protect information about you?
----------------------------------------

We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect personal information that we hold from unauthorised disclosure, use, alteration or destruction. Where appropriate, we use encryption and other technologies that can assist in securing the information you provide. We also require our service providers to comply with strict data privacy and security requirements.

How long will information about you be kept?
--------------------------------------------

We will retain information about you for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes for which the information was collected in accordance with our internal data retention standards. After that, we will delete it. The period will vary depending on the purposes for which the information was collected. Note that in some circumstances, you have the right to request us to delete the information. Also, we are sometimes subject to legal obligations, legally obliged to retain the information, for example, for tax and accounting purposes, to either retain the information for a set minimum period of time, or to delete it after a set maximum period of time.

Typically, we retain data based on the criteria described in the table below. Where these periods conflict with legal obligations, for example, for tax and accounting purposes, to either retain the information for a set minimum period of time, or to delete it after a set maximum period of time, we apply those set periods instead.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Type** | **Explanation/typical retention criteria** |
| marketing to you (including marketing communications) (if you use digital touchpoints and are contactable) | Most of the information in your marketing profile is kept for the duration of our marketing relationship with you; for example, while you continue to use digital touchpoints, or respond to our communications. However, some elements of your marketing profile, such as records of how we interact with you, naturally go out of date after a period of time, so we delete them automatically after defined periods (typically 3 years) as appropriate for the purpose for which we collected them. |
| marketing to you (including marketing communications) (if you are no longer in contact with us) | This scenario is the same as the above, but if we don’t have any contact with you for a long period (typically 2 years), we will stop sending you marketing communications and delete your history of responses to them. This will happen, for example, if you never click through to an invitation to an event, log on to a digital touchpoint, or contact customer care, during that time. The reason is that in these circumstances, we assume you would prefer not to receive the communications. |
| marketing to you (including marketing communications) (if you are not contactable) | If you have registered to receive marketing communications, but the information you give us to contact you doesn’t work, we will retain your details for a period of typically only 1 year to allow you to return and correct it. |
| marketing to you (including marketing communications) (incomplete registrations) | If you commence registering yourself in a database, but do not complete the process (for example, if you don’t complete the age verification process, or you don’t accept the touchpoint’s terms of use), we will retain your details (to allow you to return and complete the process) for up to 30 days, depending on the type of information missing. |
| market research | If you are not registered with us for other purposes (e.g. marketing communications, warranty, customer care), and we use publicly available information about you in order to understand the market or your preferences, we will retain the information about you for a short period in order to perform the particular item of market research.<br><br>If we collect information about you in other market research contexts, we will retain that information:<br><br>* for the purposes of the individual item of market research for the period reasonably required (typically no longer than 1 year); and<br>* for the purposes of demonstrating fair practices for so long as we need to be able to demonstrate that, and we will regularly review whether that purpose has been achieved to determine whether the retention is still required. |
| purchases, loyalty transactions and warranty | If you purchase goods or perform a loyalty transaction, we will retain details of this for so long as required to complete the sale, and to comply with any legal obligations (for example, for tax and accounting record-keeping purposes and fraud-prevention purposes). If you also register for a warranty for a device, we will retain details of this for so long as relevant to the warranty. |
| customer care | If you contact customer care, we will make a record of the matter (including details of your enquiry and our response) and retain it while it remains relevant to our relationship, for example if you need us to replace a device under warranty, or if your recent enquiries are relevant. Temporary records (for example, an automated recording of a telephone call in which you ask us to direct you to a retail outlet) may be relevant only until more permanent records are made and will be retained only temporarily. |
| system audit and fraud prevention | System audit logs are retained typically for a period of up to 6 months for system recovery and for up to 10 years for fraud prevention. |
| business analytics | We keep most business analytics data for the duration of our marketing relationship with you as described in the first line of this table above. However, some elements of it, such as some device information (if you choose to share it with us), naturally go out of date after a period of time, so we delete them automatically after defined periods as appropriate for the purpose for which we collected them. |
| device data | We keep data collected from your device (should you choose to share it with us) for various periods, according to the purposes for which we use it:<br><br>* product improvement: 5 years (or earlier if you delete your marketing profile)<br>* business analytics: 5 years (or earlier if you delete your marketing profile)<br>* device diagnostics and upgrades: deleted immediately after providing the service<br>* demonstrating fair treatment of a consumer: 10 years |
| age verification | The details you submitted for us to verify your age are deleted once we have completed the process of verification. We operate several processes for doing this and the retention period varies according to the process that is followed, from a few minutes to six months. We also keep some details separately, for fraud prevention purposes – see above. |
| age recognition using computer analysis (this may be used if you request information about our products) | Your image is deleted immediately following the analysis (the analysis takes only a few seconds). |

**_If you are in France, find out more…_**

Your instructions may require us to transfer information about you to a third party (but where the information contains information about others, our obligation to respect also their privacy rights might mean that we can’t follow your instructions to the letter). You may appoint a third party to be responsible for ensuring your instructions are followed. If you do not appoint a third party in that way, your successors will (unless you specify otherwise in your instructions) be entitled to exercise your rights over information about you after your death:

* in order to administer your estate (in which case your successors will be able to access information about you to identify and obtain information that could be useful to administer your estate, including any digital goods or data that could be considered a family memory that is transferable to your successors); and
* to ensure that parties using information about you take into account your death (such as closing your account, and restricting the use of, or updating, information about you).

You may amend or revoke your instructions at any time. For further information on the processing of information about you in the event of your death, see Article 40-1 of the law 78-17 dated 6 January 1978. When you die, by default, you will stop using your account and we will delete information about you in accordance with our retention policies (see the paragraph “How long will information about you be kept?” for details).
