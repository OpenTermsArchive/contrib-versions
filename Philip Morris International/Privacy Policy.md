How do we collect information about you?
----------------------------------------

We may collect information about you in various ways.

*   You may provide us with information directly (e.g. filling in a form, or making a call to us).
*   We may collect information automatically (e.g. when you use a PMI app or website).
*   We may acquire information from third parties (e.g. publicly-available information on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter).

In this notice, we refer to all the methods by which you are in contact with us as “_PMI_ _touchpoints_”. PMI touchpoints include both physical (for example, retail outlets and events), and digital (for example, apps and websites).

We may collect information that you provide directly. Typically this will happen when you:

*   sign up to be a member of our databases (this could be, for example, in person, via app, or online);
*   purchase PMI products or services at a retail outlet;
*   download, or use, a PMI digital touchpoint (e.g. an app or a website);
*   contact us through a touchpoint, or by e-mail, social media or telephone;
*   register a device with us;
*   subscribe to a PMI panel portal;
*   register to receive PMI press releases, e-mail alerts, or marketing communications;
*   participate in PMI surveys or (where permitted by law) PMI competitions or promotions; or
*   attend an event that a PMI affiliate has organised.

We may collect information about you automatically. Typically this will happen when you:

*   visit an outlet that sells PMI products (for example, by collecting your data at check-out, or through sensors at the outlet that connect with mobile technology);
*   attend an event that a PMI affiliate has organised (for example, through purchases at the event or through sensors at the event that connect with mobile technology);
*   communicate with us (for example, through a touchpoint; or social media platforms);
*   use PMI touchpoints (for example, through tracking mechanisms (such as cookies and web beacons/pixels) that you receive when you use the PMI touchpoint or get an e-mail from us);
*   use third party websites (for example, using technology similar to that described in the bullet above, that you receive when you visit a PMI touchpoint or get an e-mail from us); or
*   make public posts on social media platforms that we follow (for example, so that we can understand public opinion, or respond to requests concerning PMI products).

As mentioned above, we may collect information about you automatically through the use of cookies and similar tracking technologies (such as web beacons/pixels) that you receive when you visit digital PMI touchpoints or get an e-mail from us. The specific cookies and other mechanisms used will depend on the PMI touchpoint in question. To learn about these mechanisms used on a touchpoint, including how you can accept or refuse cookies, please see the information made available on or through that touchpoint. These mechanisms may include [Google analytics cookies](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/).

Where permitted by law, we may acquire information about you from third parties. This may include information shared between PMI affiliates, publicly-available profile information (such as your preferences and interests) on third party social media sites (such as Facebook and Twitter), and marketing lists acquired from third party marketing agencies.

We may also collect information in other contexts made apparent to you at the time.

What information about you do we collect?
-----------------------------------------

We may collect various types of information about you:

*   information necessary to fulfil your orders
    
*   information necessary to provide warranty services
    
*   information you give us in forms or surveys
    
*   information about your location, where you choose to share it with us on your mobile phone operating system
    
*   information about your visits to our outlets and events
    
*   information you give us in calls you make to call centers
    
*   information about your preferences and interests
    
*   information necessary to verify your age
    
*   information generated by your PMI electronic device (for example, _IQOS_)
    

Find Out More

Information that we collect from you directly will be apparent from the context in which you provide it. For example:

*   if you order a product from us through a touchpoint, you provide your name, contact, billing details, and the products you have chosen so that we can fulfil your order;
    

*   you may provide information on your product preferences and interests so that we can offer you products and services that will interest you;
    
*   if you make an appointment to see us (or someone supporting our products or services), we may collect your name and contact details;
    
*   we may collect information that enables us to verify your age, for example a copy of an identity document or your facial image.
    
*   if you have downloaded one of our apps, we may ask to use your location (even when the app is closed or not in use) for certain features. For example, the “find my IQOS” feature helps you find your device if lost, and it won’t work properly if you don’t share your location. We don’t keep the location data. It will be used only to allow these features and only if you agree to share this data by agreeing to the respective in-app disclosures.
    

Information that we collect automatically will generally concern:

*   details of your visit or call (such as time, date, and duration);
    
*   recordings (where permitted) of your calls or visits to PMI touchpoints, which we may transcribe to text format;
    
*   in a sales outlet or at an event (including areas in the immediate vicinity), how frequently you visit, which areas you visit and for how long, and which purchases you make;
    
*   your use of digital PMI touchpoints (such as the pages you visit, the page from which you came, and the page to which you went when you left, search terms entered, or links clicked within the touchpoint, when you first open the touchpoint, for how long you use it, and how you interact with messages or advertisements we send you); we may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (such as pixels/web beacons) to do this;
    
*   your use of third party websites, where the information collected will be similar to that described in the bullet above (we may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (such as pixels/web beacons) to do this);
    
*   your mobile or desktop device and software (such as your IP address or unique device identifier (for example, mobile advertising identifier (MAID) or Android ID (SSAID)), location data (either derived from your IP address or if you choose to share your precise location with us for specified purposes, e.g. store locator), device brand and model, the display settings of your monitor, web browser type, operating system, (some of which may be used in “digital fingerprinting” (see for what purposes we use information about you, below)) and details of any cookies that we may have stored on your device);
    
*   your use of your PMI electronic device, if you choose to send this to us, which may include information about: (i) the device itself (holder serial number, charger serial number, firmware version, device errors); and (ii) use of the device (such as number of such as number of tobacco HEET sticks (for _IQOS_), number of cleans, battery use, puff count, and device life data (including cumulative values, and timestamps, for each of the foregoing)); and
    
*   if you return your PMI electronic device to us, or bring it to one of our stores, because it’s faulty, and choose to share with us the data it holds (as above), we may extract that data from the device.
    

Information that we collect from third parties will generally consist of publicly-available profile information (such as your preferences and interests), for example from public social media posts.

For what purposes do we use information about you, and on what legal basis?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this section, we describe the purposes for which we use personal information. However, this is a global notice, and where the laws of a country restrict or prohibit certain activities described in this notice, we will not use information about you for those purposes in that country.

Subject to the above, we use information about you for the following purposes:

*   To comply with regulatory obligations, such as verifying your age and status as a user of our products
    
*   To sell our products to you, including fulfilling your orders, processing your payments
    
*   To provide sales-related services to you, including dealing with your inquiries and requests, and providing warranty and support services
    
*   To market our products (where permitted by law), including administering loyalty programs, product improvement, market research, developing marketing strategies, administering marketing campaigns, and customizing your experiences at outlets that sell PMI products and at events
    
*   To understand whether you are still engaged with our marketing and whether you wish to continue to receive it
    
*   For us or our business partners to inform you of potential opportunities to get involved in marketing or promoting PMI products
    
*   To support all the above, including administering your accounts, enabling you to use PMI touchpoints, corresponding with you, managing your appointments with us or with someone supporting our products or services (for example, regarding a new product, or after-sales service), customizing your experiences of PMI touchpoints, fraud prevention (for example in the context of our promotions, competitions and surveys, to ensure that they are not taken more than once by the same person), and administration and troubleshooting
    
*   For business analytics, statistical or scientific purposes, including improving PMI products, outlets and events, and the information that we (or our affiliates) provide to our customers
    
*   For other purposes that we notify you of, or will be clear from the context, at the point information about you is first collected
    

The legal basis for our use of information about you is one of the following (which we explain in more detail in the “find out more” section):

*   compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject;
    
*   the performance of a contract to which you are a party;
    
*   a legitimate business interest that is not overridden by interests you have to protect the information;
    
*   where none of the above applies, or where law requires it, your consent (which we will ask for before we process the information).

Where might information about you be sent?
------------------------------------------

As with any multinational organisation, PMI affiliates transfer information globally. Accordingly, information about you may be transferred globally (for example, if you are in the European Economic Area ("EEA"), your information may be transferred outside the EEA; if you are in Australia, you information may be transferred outside Australia).

Find Out More

When using information as described in this notice, information about you may be transferred either within or outside the country or territory where it was collected, including to a country or territory that may not have equivalent data protection standards.

For example, PMI affiliates within the EEA may transfer personal information to PMI affiliates outside the EEA. In all such cases, the transfer will be:

*   on the basis of a [European Commission adequacy decision](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm);
*   subject to appropriate safeguards, for example the [EU Model Contracts](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/transfer/index_en.htm); or
*   necessary to discharge obligations under a contract between you and us (or the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken at your request) or for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in your interest between us and a third party, such as in relation to travel arrangements.

In all cases, appropriate security measures for the protection of personal information will be applied in those countries or territories, in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

Our service providers are located in many countries throughout the world, including in particular the EEA, Switzerland, the USA, Canada, India, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Australia.

How do we protect information about you?
----------------------------------------

We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect personal information that we hold from unauthorised disclosure, use, alteration or destruction. Where appropriate, we use encryption and other technologies that can assist in securing the information you provide. We also require our service providers to comply with strict data privacy and security requirements.

How long will information about you be kept?
--------------------------------------------

We will retain information about you for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes for which the information was collected. After that, we will delete it. The period will vary depending on the purposes for which the information was collected. Note that in some circumstances, you have the right to request us to delete the information. Also, we are sometimes legally obliged to retain the information, for example, for tax and accounting purposes.

Find Out More

Typically, we retain data based on the criteria described in the table below:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |How long will information about you be kept?
| **Type** | ****Explanation/typical retention criteria**** |
| *   marketing to you (including marketing communications) (if you use digital touchpoints and are contactable) | Most of the information in your marketing profile is kept for the duration of our marketing relationship with you; for example, while you continue to use digital touchpoints, or respond to our communications. However, some elements of your marketing profile, such as records of how we interact with you, naturally go out of date after a period of time, so we delete them automatically after defined periods (typically 3 years) as appropriate for the purpose for which we collected them. |
| *   marketing to you (including marketing communications) (if you are no longer in contact with us) | This scenario is the same as the above, but if we don’t have any contact with you for a long period (typically 2 years), we will stop sending you marketing communications and delete your history of responses to them. This will happen, for example, if you never click through to an invitation to an event, log on to a digital touchpoint, or contact customer care, during that time. The reason is that in these circumstances, we assume you would prefer not to receive the communications. |
| *   marketing to you (including marketing communications) (if you are not contactable) | If you have registered to receive marketing communications, but the information you give us to contact you doesn’t work, we will retain your details for a period of typically only 6 months to allow you to return and correct it. |
| *   marketing to you (including marketing communications) (incomplete registrations) | If you commence registering yourself in a database, but do not complete the process (for example, if you don’t complete the age verification process, or you don’t accept the touchpoint’s terms of use), we will retain your details for only 6 months to allow you to return and complete the process. |
| *   market research | If you are not registered with us for other purposes (e.g. marketing communications, warranty, customer care), and we use publicly available information about you in order to understand the market or your preferences, we will retain the information about you for a short period in order to perform the particular item of market research. |
| *   purchases and warranty | If you purchase goods, we will retain details of this for so long as required to complete the sale, and to comply with any legal obligations (for example, for tax and accounting record-keeping purposes). If you also register for a warranty for a device, we will retain details of this for so long as relevant to the warranty. |
| *   customer care | If you contact customer care, we will make a record of the matter (including details of your enquiry and our response) and retain it while it remains relevant to our relationship, for example if you need us to replace a device under warranty, or if your recent enquiries are relevant. Temporary records (for example, an automated recording of a telephone call in which you ask us to direct you to a retail outlet) may be relevant only until more permanent records are made, and will be retained only temporarily. |
| *   system audit logs | System audit logs are retained typically for a period of only a few months. |
| *   business analytics | Business analytics data is typically collected automatically when you use PMI touchpoints and anonymised/aggregated shortly afterwards. |

What rights and options do you have?
------------------------------------

You may have some or all of the following rights in respect of information about you that we hold:

*   request us to give you access to it;
*   request us to rectify it, update it, or erase it;
*   request us to restrict our using it, in certain circumstances;

| *   to request us to restrict our processing of it | This right applies, temporarily while we look into your case, if you:<br><br>*   contest the accuracy of the information we use; or<br>*   have objected to our using the information on the basis of legitimate interest<br>    <br>    (if you make use of your right in these cases, we will tell you before we use the information again).<br>    <br>    This right applies also if:<br>    <br>*   our use is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of the data; or<br><br>we no longer need the data, but you require it to establish a legal case. |

If you are in the Philippines, you may have rights in addition to those set out in this notice in accordance with the Philippine Data Privacy Act and its implementing rules and regulations, including the National Privacy Commission’s Privacy Policy Office Advisory Opinion No. 2018-031.

  

**_If you are in France, find out more..._**

*   If you are in France, you have the right to give us instructions regarding information we hold about you in the event of your death (specifically, whether we should store or delete it, and whether others should have the right to see it). You may:

1.  issue general instructions to a digital service provider registered with the French data protection supervisory authority (called “CNIL”) (these instructions apply to all use of information about you); or
2.  give us specific instructions that apply only to our use of information about you.

Your instructions may require us to transfer information about you to a third party (but where the information contains information about others, our obligation to respect also their privacy rights might mean that we can’t follow your instructions to the letter). You may appoint a third party to be responsible for ensuring your instructions are followed. If you do not appoint a third party in that way, your successors will (unless you specify otherwise in your instructions) be entitled to exercise your rights over information about you after your death:

*   in order to administer your estate (in which case your successors will be able to access information about you to identify and obtain information that could be useful to administer your estate, including any digital goods or data that could be considered a family memory that is transferable to your successors); and
*   to ensure that parties using information about you take into account your death (such as closing your account, and restricting the use of, or updating, information about you).

You may amend or revoke your instructions at any time. For further information on the processing of information about you in the event of your death, see Article 40-1 of the law 78-17 dated 6 January 1978. When you die, by default, you will stop using your account and we will delete information about you in accordance with our retention policies (see the paragraph “How long will information about you be kept?” for details).
