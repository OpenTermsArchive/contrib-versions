How do we collect information about you?
----------------------------------------

We may collect information about you in various ways.

* You may provide us with information directly (e.g. filling in a form, making a call to us, or uploading information to us via a mobile app).
* We may collect information from a PMI electronic device, if you choose to send information to us.
* We may collect information automatically when you interact with our systems or we communicate with you (e.g. when you use a PMI app or website or, where we use technologies to observe when you receive or open e-mails or receive SMS messages).
* We may also collect information from third parties (e.g. publicly-available information, information on social media platforms such as Meta and X). For example, where permitted by law, we may infer information about you from aggregated information we acquire from third parties. By way of example, this may include statistical information about people in certain geographical areas.

In this notice, we refer to all the methods by which you are in contact with us as “PMI touchpoints”. PMI touchpoints include both physical touchpoints (for example, retail outlets (these include both PMI owned and controlled retail outlets and third-party retail outlets), events (these include events arranged by PMI and third-party events at which PMI is present), consumer contact centres), and digital touchpoints (for example, apps, social media and websites).

We may collect information that you provide directly. Typically, this will happen when you:

* sign up to be a member of our databases (including loyalty programs), which will include performing age verification (this could be in person, via an app, or online, including AI analysis of your face);
* request information about our products, which may include age recognition (this could be in person, via an app, or online, including AI analysis of your face);
* purchase PMI products or services at a retail outlet;
* download, or use, a PMI digital touchpoint (e.g. an app or a website);
* contact us through a touchpoint, or by e-mail, social media or telephone;
* register a device with us;
* subscribe to a PMI panel portal;
* register to receive PMI press releases, e-mail alerts, or marketing communications or other promotional materials;
* participate in surveys or (where permitted by law) competitions or promotions; or
* engage with one of our sales representatives or attend an event that a PMI affiliate has organised.

We may collect information from an electronic device, if you choose to share the information with us. This may be shared with us through a direct connection to the internet, or via one of our apps that you have downloaded.

We may collect information about you automatically. Typically, this will happen when you:

* visit an outlet that sells PMI products (for example, by collecting your data at check-out, or through sensors at the outlet that connect with mobile technology);
* attend an event that a PMI affiliate has organised (for example, through purchases at the event or through sensors at the event that connect with mobile technology);
* communicate with us (for example, through a touchpoint, or social media platforms);
* use PMI digital touchpoints for example, through tracking mechanisms (such as cookies, web beacons/pixels and other tracking technologies such as device identifiers);
* use third party websites (for example, using technology similar to that described in the bullet above); 
* make public posts on social media platforms that we follow (for example, so that we can understand public opinion, or respond to requests concerning PMI products); or
* are referred to us by another consumer of PMI products. 

As mentioned above, we may collect information about you automatically through the use of cookies and similar tracking technologies if you agree to (or do not opt out of) their use when you visit PMI digital touchpoints. The specific cookies and other tracking technologies used will depend on the touchpoint in question. To learn about the mechanisms used on a particular PMI touchpoint, including how you can accept or refuse them, please see the information made available on or through that touchpoint. You should review the privacy notice of these providers to see how they process personal data about you. These mechanisms may include Google analytics cookies (see [https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites)).

We use these cookies and other tracking technologies to conduct digital personalized advertising that is relevant to you, using various partners. This may involve matching the email addresses and mobile phone numbers that we hold for you with the email addresses of our advertising partners, to show you the most relevant digital advertisements (where permitted by law). We only do this where you have given us consent (or have not opted out of data sharing according to applicable law). Sometimes we may also process information about you to build lookalike profiles. This allows us to generate similar audiences for prospective customers (who may have similar interests or demographics to you) through advertising platforms like Google, based on data that the advertising platform holds about other people. Usually this means sharing your email address with our advertising partners.

In addition, where permitted by law, we may acquire information about you from third parties. This may include information shared between PMI affiliates, publicly available profile information (such as your preferences and interests) on third party social media sites (such as Facebook and X), marketing lists and supplementary information acquired from third party agencies. For such data, PMI may act as an independent controller in certain cases, or a joint controller with the third party in relation to these processing activities. 

Where you log in to your account using a social media account (e.g. Facebook, Google, etc.) we have no control or influence over the data that social networking site collects via that plugin or link. For more information, please consult the relevant data privacy notice of these third parties.

We may also collect information in other contexts made apparent to you at the time.

What information about you do we collect?
-----------------------------------------

We may collect various types of information about you such as:

* information about your orders, including information necessary to fulfil them
* information necessary to provide warranty services
* information about the referrals you make
* information you give us in forms or surveys, and similar information that you give to third parties to be transferred to us
* information about your location, where you choose to share it with us (for example, on your mobile phone)
* information about your visits to our outlets or events (or outlets or events of others with whom we work)
* information you give us in communications (e.g. letters, calls, chats, e-mails, SMS and instant messages)
* information about your preferences and interests (including information that we infer from other information, for example from statistical information)
* information necessary to verify your age such as identification documents or using AI analysis of your face
* information generated by your electronic device (for example, IQOS), if you choose to share it with us
* information about your experience of using our products and services
* statistical information about you (for example, statistical information about people in certain geographical areas)
* information that may relate to adverse events (such as any unwanted health effect when using one of our products) when you report them to us
* information about you that we acquire from third parties, where you agreed that the third party can share your data with others.

Information that we collect from you directly will be apparent from the context in which you provide it. For example:

* if you order a product from us through a touchpoint, you provide your name, contact, billing details, payment methods, and the products you have chosen so that we can fulfil your order;
* you may provide information on your product preferences, interests and experience so that we can offer you products and services that will interest you, and to improve our products and services;
* if you make an appointment to see us (or someone supporting our products or services), we may collect your name and contact details;
* we may collect information that enables us to verify your age, for example a copy of an identity document or your facial image (either as a photograph or a video);
* if you have downloaded one of our apps, we may ask to use your location (even when the app is closed or not in use) for certain features. For example, the “find my IQOS” feature helps you find your device if lost, and it won’t work properly if you don’t share your location. We don’t keep the location data. It will only be used to allow these features and only if you agree to share this data by agreeing to the respective in-app disclosures;
* if you communicate with one of our contact centres, you may give us information, for example about your experiences using our products and services, to allow us to deal with your requests.

Information that we collect from an electronic device, if you choose to share the information with us. This may include, for a PMI electronic device, information about: (i) the device itself (such as holder serial number, charger serial number, firmware version, device errors); and (ii) use of the device (such as number of consumable items (e.g. for the IQOS device), number of cleans, battery use, puff count, usage patterns and device life data (including cumulative values, and timestamps, for each of the foregoing)).

Information that we collect automatically will generally concern:

* details of your visit or call (such as time, date, and duration);
* audio or video recordings (where permitted) of your calls or visits to PMI touchpoints, which we may transcribe to text format;
* your visits to sales outlets or participation at events (including areas in the immediate vicinity), how frequently you visit, which areas you visit and for how long, and which purchases you make;
* your use of PMI digital touchpoints (such as the pages you visit, the page from which you came, and the page to which you went when you left, search terms entered, or links clicked within the touchpoint, when you first open the touchpoint, for how long you use it, and how you interact with messages we send you or advertisements we show you); we may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (such as pixels/web beacons) to do this;
* your use of third-party websites, where the information collected will be similar to that described in the bullet above (we may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (such as pixels/web beacons) to do this);
* your mobile or desktop device and software (such as your IP address or unique device identifier (for example, mobile advertising identifier (MAID) or Android ID (SSAID)), location data (either your general location (derived from your IP address, in which case the information we have will be general, e.g. the town you are in), or your precise location (if you choose to share it with us for specified purposes, e.g. store locator)), device brand and model, the display settings of your monitor, web browser type, operating system, (some of which may be used in “digital fingerprinting” (see for what purposes we process information about you, below)) and details of any cookies (or similar technologies) that we may have stored on your device); 
* if you return your PMI electronic device to us, we may extract data from the device in order to check why that device has stopped working. If you take your device to one of our stores because it is faulty we will only extract data where you agree to share the data it holds with us;
* where permitted by law, we may infer information about you from information about you that we already have. For example, we may analyse your interactions with us to conduct segmentation and profiling to improve our products and services, customize our offers and communications to you, or we may use aggregated information about people in certain geographical areas, that we acquire from third parties, to infer your preferences.

Information that we collect from third parties will generally consist of publicly available information (such as your preferences, interests and experiences), for example from public social media posts.

For what purposes do we use information about you, and on what legal basis?

* For business analytics, statistical or scientific purposes, including improving PMI products (for data collected from PMI electronic devices, this will apply if you have chosen to send the information to us for these purposes or if you return a device to us) and services, outlets and events, and the information that we (or our affiliates) provide to you
* For other purposes that we notify you of, or will be clear from the context, at the point information about you is first collected

The legal basis for our use of information about you is one of the following (which we explain in more detail in the “find out more” section):

* compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject;
* the performance of a contract to which you are a party;

Where this is the case, we will provide a supplemental privacy notice that explains such use. You should read any supplemental notice in conjunction with this notice.

Do we use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

We may use artificial intelligence (AI) features to enhance your consumer experience. By way of example, the consumer portal may include a conversational chatbot supported by AI features that answers frequently asked questions and assists you with navigating the portal. The chatbot can help you search for products, manage your account, and provide support.

Additionally, we may use AI features, such as machine learning and statistical algorithms, to support the analysis of your behaviors and interactions with PMI touchpoints and conduct segmentation and profiling, where permitted by law. This helps us understand and enhance your experience, improve our products and services and tailor them to provide you a personalized experience. By way of example, these AI features analyze various data points, such as purchase history, browsing behavior, and demographic information, to determine, based on similarities between consumers’ patterns and behaviors, which segment you may belong to and allow our teams (human intervention) to use this information to undertake relevant and personalized actions that are most relevant to you. 

We may also use AI capabilities to assist us in preventing fraudulent actions. Other uses of AI features may be applied to assist you to conduct technical diagnostics, including firmware updates, regarding your device when you approach us in one of our touchpoints.

Lastly, we may also use AI features in our interactions with you to support customer care services, improve their efficiency (including your satisfaction with these services) and quality reviews of customer care interactions. This helps us to measure your customer experience, provide the best possible customer care support and identify areas for improvement. For example, by analyzing such interactions, we can better understand common issues and trends, leading to higher customer service and satisfaction.

Who do we share your information with, and for what purposes?
-------------------------------------------------------------

We may share information about you with:

* PMI affiliates;
* third parties who provide PMI affiliates or you with products or services;
* PMI affiliates’ carefully selected business partners and advertisers (in areas connected with our products) so that they can contact you with offers that they think may interest you, in accordance with your preferences; and
* other third parties, where required or permitted by law.

We share information about you with others only in accordance with applicable laws. Thus, where the law requires your consent, we will ask for it before sharing your data.

_Sharing data with other PMI affiliates_

Information about you will be shared with Philip Morris Products S.A. (based in Lausanne, Switzerland), which is the place of central administration of personal data processing for PMI affiliates. Philip Morris Products S.A. processes the information about you for the purposes described in this notice as a data controller, for example to improve our products and services.

Information about you will be shared with the PMI affiliate established in the country in which you live (if it wasn’t the PMI affiliate that first collected the information) for the purposes described in this notice.

Information about you may be shared with other PMI affiliates that you contact (for example, if you travel and you want to know where to buy PMI products in a new country, or where to find service or support for PMI products) in order to enhance our services to you.

Details of PMI affiliates and the countries in which they are established are available [here](https://www.pmiprivacy.com/global/en/consumer/affiliates/).

_Sharing data with Third Parties_

To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may share information about you with third parties who provide PMI affiliates or you with products or services (such as payment service providers, delivery providers, retailers, market research agencies, product coaches, advisers, information services providers and age verification providers).

To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may share information about you with carefully selected third party business partners and advertisers (in line with the kind of thing you might associate with our products, for example because they have similar or complementary image, style, or functionality) so that they can contact you with products, services and promotions that they think may interest you, in accordance with your preferences.

We may share information about you with other third parties, where required or permitted by law, for example: regulatory authorities; government departments; in response to a request from law enforcement authorities or other government officials; when we consider disclosure to be necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity; and in the context of organisational restructuring.

Where might information about you be sent?
------------------------------------------

As with any multinational organisation, we transfer information globally to our affiliates and service providers. Your data may therefore be transferred to other countries as part of our standard operations. Whenever we transfer your data abroad, we will limit access to your data only to those who need to see it, process your data in accordance with our internal data protection standards, protect it appropriately and only transfer information in compliance with applicable data privacy laws. When data is transferred, we will require the receiving party to keep your data confidential, delete it when it is no longer required and act in accordance with this privacy notice. Accordingly, information about you may be transferred outside of your jurisdiction. For example, if you live in the EEA, UK, Australia or Japan, your data may be processed in another country.

When using information as described in this notice, information about you may be transferred either within or outside the country or territory where it was collected, including to a country or territory that may not have equivalent data protection standards.

For example, we and other PMI affiliates within the EEA may transfer personal information to PMI affiliates, or to their service providers, outside the EEA. In all such cases, the transfer will be:

* on the basis of a [European Commission adequacy decision](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en);
* subject to appropriate safeguards, for example the [EU Standard Contractual Clauses](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en) or [binding corporate rules](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/binding-corporate-rules-bcr_en); or
* with your consent or as necessary to discharge obligations under a contract between you and us (or the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken at your request) or for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in your interest between us and a third party, such as in relation to travel arrangements.

For transfers from Switzerland and the UK, in accordance with the Federal Act on Data Protection and UK GDPR and guidance of the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner and Information Commissioner’s Office. In all cases, appropriate security measures for the protection of personal information will be applied in those countries or territories, in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

Our service providers are located in many countries throughout the world, including in particular the EEA, Switzerland, the USA, Canada, India, Turkey, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Australia.

How do we protect information about you?
----------------------------------------

We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect personal information that we hold from unauthorised disclosure, use, alteration or destruction. Where appropriate, we use encryption and other technologies that can assist in securing the information you provide. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we use reasonable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security or confidentiality.

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access any portal or account, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password(s) with anyone.

If you suspect any misuse or loss of or unauthorised access to your personal information, please let us know immediately. Please raise your concern by contacting us (using these [Details](https://www.pmiprivacy.com/global/en/consumer/affiliates/)), in the first instance, and we will investigate the matter and update you as soon as possible on next steps.

How long will information about you be kept?
--------------------------------------------

We will retain information about you for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes for which the information was collected in accordance with our internal data retention standards. After that, we will delete it. The period will vary depending on the purposes for which the information was collected. Note that in some circumstances, you have the right to request us to delete the information. Also, we are sometimes legally obliged to retain the information, for example, for tax and accounting purposes.

Typically, we retain data based on the criteria described in the table below. Where these periods conflict with legal obligations, for example, for tax and accounting purposes, to either retain the information for a set minimum period of time, or to delete it after a set maximum period of time, we apply those set periods instead.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Type** | **Explanation/typical retention criteria** |
| marketing to you (including marketing communications) (if you use digital touchpoints and are contactable) | Most of the information in your marketing profile is kept for the duration of our marketing relationship with you; for example, while you continue to use digital touchpoints, or respond to our communications. However, some elements of your marketing profile, such as records of how we interact with you, naturally date and may be inaccurate after a period of time, so we delete them automatically after defined periods (typically 3 years) as appropriate for the purpose for which we collected them. |
| marketing to you (including marketing communications) (if you are no longer in contact with us) | If we don’t have any contact with you for a long period (typically 3 years), we will stop sending you marketing communications and typically data are deleted or anonymised. This will happen, for example, if you do not click through to an invitation to an event, log on to a digital touchpoint, or contact customer care, during that 3-year period. The reason is that in these circumstances, we assume you would prefer not to receive communications from us. |
| marketing to you (including marketing communications) (if you are not contactable) | If you have registered to receive marketing communications, but the contact information no longer works, we will retain your details for a period of time (typically 1 year) to allow you to return and correct it. |
| marketing to you (including marketing communications) (incomplete registrations) | If you commence registering yourself in a database, but do not complete the process (for example, if you do not complete the age verification process, or you do not accept the touchpoint’s terms of use), we will retain your details (to allow you to return and complete the process) for up to 30 days, depending on the type of information that is missing. |
| market research | If you are not registered with us for other purposes (e.g. marketing communications, warranty, customer care), and we use publicly available information about you in order to understand the market or your preferences, we will retain information about you for a short period of time in order to perform the particular market research activity.<br><br>If we collect information about you in other market research contexts, we will retain that information:<br><br>* for the purposes of the individual item of market research for the period reasonably required (typically no longer than 1 year); and<br>* for the purposes of demonstrating fair practices, for so long as we need to be able to demonstrate that, and we will regularly review whether that purpose has been achieved to determine whether the retention is still required. |
| purchases, loyalty transactions and warranty | If you purchase goods or perform a loyalty transaction, we will retain details of this for so long as required to complete the sale, and to comply with any legal obligations (for example, for tax and accounting record-keeping purposes and fraud-prevention purposes). If you also register for a warranty for a device, we will retain details of this for so long as relevant to the warranty period. |
| customer care | If you contact customer care, we will maintain a record of the interaction (including details of your enquiry and our response) and retain it while it remains relevant to our relationship, for example if you need us to replace a device under warranty, or if your recent enquiries are relevant. Temporary records (for example, an automated recording of a telephone call in which you ask us to direct you to a retail outlet) may be relevant only until more permanent records are made and will be retained only temporarily. |
| system audit and fraud prevention | System audit logs are retained typically for a period of up to 6 months for system recovery and for up to 10 years for fraud prevention. |
| business analytics | We keep most business analytics data for the duration of our marketing relationship with you as described in the first line of the table above. However, some elements of it, such as some device information (if you choose to share it with us), naturally go out of date after a period of time, so we delete this automatically after defined periods as appropriate for the purpose for which we collected them. |
| device data | We keep data collected from your device (should you choose to share it with us or return a faulty device to us) for various periods, according to the purposes for which we use it:<br><br>* product improvement: 5 years (or earlier if you delete your marketing profile)<br>* business analytics: 5 years (or earlier if you delete your marketing profile)<br>* device care including device diagnostics and upgrades: 5 years <br>* demonstrating fair treatment of a consumer: 10 years |
| age verification | The details you submitted for us to verify your age are deleted once we have completed the process of verification. We operate several processes for doing this and the retention period varies according to the process that is followed, from a few minutes to six months. We also keep some details separately, for fraud prevention purposes – see above. |
| age recognition using AI (this may be used if you request information about our products) | Your image is deleted immediately following the analysis which only takes a few seconds. |
