Security Management System consists of appropriate technical, administrative, and organizational security measures to protect personal data against unauthorized access, disclosure, destruction, or other unauthorized processing.

Administrative and organizational measures:

* Role based access rights management

Technical measures:

* Firewalls
* Backups
* Access controls
* Monitoring of processing

* Encrypted network connections (HTTPS)

Nevertheless, considering the cyber threats in modern day online environment, we cannot give full guarantee that our security measures will prevent illegally and maliciously operating third parties from obtaining access to personal data or absolute security of the personal data during its transmission or storage on our systems.

All parties processing personal data have a duty of confidentiality in matters related to the processing of personal data. Access to personal data is restricted to those employees and parties who need it to perform their duties. We also require our service providers to have appropriate methods in place to protect personal data.

### **9\. USE OF COOKIES AND SIMILIAR TECHNOLOGIES**

The Epassi website uses cookies.

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer and contains information. Cookies are normally used to improve the website for you as a visitor. There are two types:

One type saves a file that remains on the visitor's computer. This file is used, for example, to make it easier for you to use the website according to your preferences and interests.

The second type is called session cookie. While a visitor is on a website, it is temporarily stored in the visitor's computer memory. Session cookies disappear when you close your browser. No personal information is stored about you, such as your email address and name.

Our website uses both types. When you visit the site, a session cookie is sent between your computer and our web server to facilitate navigation, among other things. Session cookies are also used when you use our e-services. The cookie disappears when you end your visit.

Our website also uses Google Analytics to collect anonymous data for service development purposes.

### **10\. AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING AND PROFILING**

Epassi does not use any automated decision-making nor any profiling pursuant to the Article 22 GDPR.

### **11\. RIGHT OF THE DATA SUBJECTS**

The data subject has certain rights in relation to the processing of personal data under applicable data protection laws.

**Right of access and right of inspection**

The data subject has the right to obtain confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning them is being processed.

The data subject has the right to inspect and view data concerning them and, upon a request, the right to obtain the data in a written or electric form. This applies to information that the data subject has provided to Epassi insofar the processing is based on a contract/consent.

Exercising this right is generally free of charge.

**Right to rectification and right to erasure**

The data subject has the right to demand the rectification of incorrect personal data concerning them and to have incomplete personal data completed.

The data subject has the right to require Epassi to delete or stop processing the data subject’s personal data, for example where the data is no longer necessary for the purposes of processing. However, please note that certain personal data is strictly necessary in order to achieve the purposes defined in this privacy policy and may also be required to be retained by applicable laws.

**Right to data portability**

The data subject has the right to receive the personal data that he or she has provided to Epassi in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and, if desired, transmit that data to another controller. The right to data portability applies on the processing of the personal data based on consent or a contract.

**Right to restriction of processing**

The data subject has the right, under conditions defined by data protection legislation, to request the restriction of processing of his or her personal data. In situations where personal data suspected to be incorrect cannot be corrected or removed, or if the removal request is unclear, Epassi will limit the access to such data.

**Right to object to processing**

The data subject has the right to object to the processing of your personal data where Epassi is relying on its legitimate interests as the legal ground for processing. For example, the data subject may object to his or her personal data being used for marketing purposes.

**Right to withdraw consent**

In cases where the processing is based on the data subjects’ consent, the data subject has the right to withdraw his or her consent to such processing at any time.

**Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority**

The data subject has the right to lodge a complaint with a competent data protection authority if the data subject considers that the processing of personal data relating to the data subject infringes current legislation.

However, we request that the matter will be dealt with Epassi in the first instance.

The relevant authority in Finland is the Data Protection Ombudsman ([http://www.tietosuoja.fi](http://www.tietosuoja.fi/))

In Sweden relevant authority is Swedish Data Protection Authority ([https://www.imy.se/](https://www.imy.se/)).

**Exercising rights**

Requests regarding the rights of data subjects shall be made in written or in electronic form, and the request shall be addressed to the controller, Epassi.

Identity will be checked before the information is given out, which is why we may have to ask for additional details. The request will be responded to within a reasonable time and, where possible, within one month of the request and the verification of identity.

If the data subject’s request cannot be met, the refusal shall be communicated to the data subject in writing. Epassi may refuse the request (for example erasure of data) due to a statutory obligation or a statutory right of the company, such as an obligation or a claim relating to our services. Please note that Epassi may charge a reasonable fee where requests from a data subject are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character.

The data subject may exercise the aforementioned rights by sending a written request by email or mail using the contact information provided in this privacy policy, including the following information: name, phone number, email address, user id and details of the products and services you have used.

If you have any questions relating to our data protection policies or wish to exercise your rights, please do not hesitate to contact us.

### **12\. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY**

Epassi may make changes to this privacy policy at any time by giving a notice on the website and/or by other applicable means. The data subjects are highly recommended to review the privacy policy on our website every now and then.

If the data subject objects to any of the changes to this privacy policy, the data subject should cease using the services, where applicable, and he/she can request that we remove the personal data, unless applicable laws require us to retain such personal data. Unless stated otherwise, the then-current privacy policy applies to all personal data we process at the time.
