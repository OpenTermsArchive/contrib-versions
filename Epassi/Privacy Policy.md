### Privacy Policy

### **Epassi Finland Oy, Epassi Sweden AB and Epassi Clearing Oy**

### **1\. GENERAL INFORMATION**

Epassi Finland Oy, Epassi Sweden AB, and Epassi Clearing Oy (together “Epassi” or “we” in all grammatical forms) respect your privacy and aim to maintain the protection of personal data of individuals using Epassi’s services. This Privacy Policy describes how Epassi processes personal data, including what types of personal data are collected, the purposes for which personal data is used, and to whom personal data may be disclosed.

This Privacy Policy applies when you use Epassi’s services, including services intended for Epassi end-users and our websites.  
It also applies in other situations listed in section 3 below, for example when we communicate about our services or manage customer relationships with our clients’ contact persons.

Personal data refers to any information relating to a natural person (“data subject”) that can identify the person directly or indirectly. Terms such as personal data, data subject, and controller are defined in the General Data Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679, “GDPR”), which applies to all processing of personal data by Epassi. Epassi complies with the GDPR and other applicable national data protection laws (“data protection legislation”) in all personal data processing.

Our services may also include links to external websites and services to which this Privacy Policy does not apply. These websites or services are operated by other organizations that Epassi does not control and therefore Epassi is not responsible for their processing of personal data. For this reason, we encourage you to review the applicable privacy policies of those websites or services.

Epassi uses tools that leverage artificial intelligence (AI), including large language models and machine learning models, in the delivery of its services. However, Epassi’s use of AI is strictly limited by contractual agreements, technical restrictions, and internal policies to ensure that personal data is never disclosed to AI models in a way that would compromise data protection, such as by training the AI. The use of these tools and applications within Epassi does not affect or hinder the exercise of data subject rights. You always have the option to refuse the processing of your personal data by AI by notifying Epassi as described in section 9, “Data Subject Rights.”

### 4\. Sources of Personal Data

Personal data is primarily collected directly from data subjects, for example, during registration for our services, while using them, or during the customer relationship.

Personal data concerning end-users is also collected from the end-user’s employer in connection with services provided jointly by the employer and Epassi under their service agreement. This data is collected to register the end-user as an Epassi consumer customer by creating a personal account and to report the use of employment benefits to the employer for tax purposes.

Personal data received from employers is used solely to identify the end-user for service access, and data about the end-user’s service usage is disclosed to the employer only to the extent necessary to provide benefits or as otherwise agreed for benefit tracking.

In connection with Epassi’s legal obligations regarding payment instruments and customer due diligence, Epassi may update and supplement related data from private and public sources.
