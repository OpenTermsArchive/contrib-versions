**I. Epassi Service**  

The Epassi service is a digital service where you can use the employee benefits provided by your employer to pay for the products and services of Service Providers, or the functionalities of the Epassi Wallet. The Epassi service, its content, and Services may include advertisements from Epassi, Service Providers, or third parties. Third-party services are subject to third-party terms and conditions.

Service Providers provide information in the Epassi service about the products and services they offer, including product descriptions and prices. If the user has any restrictions related to the use of the Service Provider’s products or services, the user must agree on those directly with the Service Provider.

Through the Epassi service, the user may enter into a contractual relationship with third parties, i.e., Service Providers and Partners. In such cases, an independent contractual relationship is formed between the user and the Service Provider or Partner. Epassi encourages all users to review the terms and conditions before committing to them.

**I.1. Deployment**

When you download the Epassi app from the application store and approve the Terms of Use in the app or log in to the Epassi Service and approve the Terms of Use, a contract on the Epassi Service deployment has been established between you and Epassi. For the deployment of Epassi Service, Epassi will provide you with a one time password. Use of Epassi’s services requires the user to confirms their identity through strong authentication and set-up of a personal PIN code.

Using the Epassi Service for professional or commercial activities is prohibited.

The deployment of Epassi Wallet requires further actions from the user (see section “II Epassi Wallet”).

**I.2. Epassi Service availability and technical conditions**

The Epassi service is available via a mobile application or as a web service at https://services.epassi.fi. The different usage methods of the Epassi service may have differing features from each other or its usage possibilities may be limited in relation to another usage method.

Using the Epassi service requires an Epassi account, a smart device and a compatible operating system or a computer and a functioning internet connection. The Epassi account is by default personal, unless otherwise agreed. You are responsible for the operation, data security, and compatibility of your device as well as arranging the internet connection. You must ensure that you are using the latest possible version of the Epassi application. Version updates are published in the application store. Not performing updates may prevent the use of the Epassi service or Services.

Epassi does not guarantee that the Epassi service or Services are continuously available. Epassi or the Service Provider may interrupt the provision or use of the Service without notifying the user in advance or according to the separate terms of each Service. Epassi strives to inform in advance within a reasonable time about known service interruptions and to schedule regular interruptions and updates during the service’s quiet usage hours. Epassi reserves the full right to interrupt the provision of the Service during maintenance and other such breaks.

**I.3 Customer’s responsibility and careful use**

You are responsible for ensuring that the user information you provide is correct and always up to date. Your PIN code, with which you log in to the Epassi Service, is personal. The PIN code must not be given to other individuals. The user is responsible for all use of their Epassi account related to the Epassi Service.

If you suspect that your device or Epassi account information has ended up in the hands of a third party, you must immediately report it to Epassi customer service. Merely closing the phone subscription provided by the operator is not sufficient to prevent the use of the Epassi service and the execution of payment transactions.

In cases of misuse and/or loss, you are responsible for the use of the Services and the payments made in the Services until you have made a loss report to Epassi, and your account has been closed.

Epassi is never responsible for any possible damages caused to a third party by your incorrect procedure.

**I.4. Service fees and compensations**  
  
The use of the Epassi service is free of charge, but requires data transfer over the network.

Your operator may charge fees related to mobile data transfer. You are responsible for the costs of data transfer or other telecommunication services charged for the use of the Epassi service and Services. Any possible fees or charges related to the use of the Services offered in the Epassi service are agreed separately with the Service Provider or Epassi at the time of the transaction.

Additional terms related to the use of the Epassi Wallet are in section “II Epassi Wallet”.

**I.5 Epassi’s right to close the Epassi Service**  
  
Epassi has the right to close the Epassi service and prevent its use entirely or partially if:

* you have provided false information during registration or later;
* you have become subject to international sanctions;
* the security of the use of the Epassi service has been compromised;
* there is reason to suspect that the Epassi service is being used unlawfully or fraudulently;
* there is reason to suspect that your mobile device compromises the security of the Epassi service;
* you have used the Epassi service in a manner that is likely to jeopardize the reputation of Epassi or its Service Provider (e.g., as a platform for communication that Epassi or its Service Provider does not consider appropriate or in accordance with good practice); or
* Epassi needs to change the Epassi service or its terms in such a way that continuing its use under the new terms or features requires your acceptance, and you have not given your acceptance.

Epassi will notify you of the closure and/or restriction of the Epassi service by email to the address you have provided or by a notice published in the application.

International sanctions refer to sanctions, economic sanctions, export or import bans, trade embargoes, or other restrictive measures imposed, administered, approved, or enforced by the Finnish state, the United Nations, the European Union, the United States of America, and the United Kingdom or their competent authorities or institutions.

If you believe that there is a defect in the Epassi service, you have the legal remedies available under applicable law. Epassi primarily strives to correct the defect. If you notice a defect, please contact Epassi customer service.

Epassi does not guarantee that the Service is error-free or available without interruption. If we cause damage by acting contrary to the agreement, we will only compensate for direct damage, unless we have caused the damage intentionally, through gross negligence, or unless otherwise provided by mandatory law.

Epassi or Clearing is not responsible for the content, terms, functionality, security, or user fees related to the services offered by the Service Providers or Partners included in the Epassi service or other third-party credit and/or payment institutions.

Epassi or Clearing is not responsible for the interruption of the Service or damage caused by force majeure or other similar reasons that unreasonably complicate Epassi's operations.

**I.7 Changes to the contract, terms of contract and service features**  
  
Epassi continuously develops the Service, and Epassi has the right to change these terms, the content of the Epassi service, and the requirements set for the devices intended for the use of the Epassi service. Epassi will notify you of significant changes either by a message to your mobile device, email, or a notice published in the application. Changes that do not increase your obligations or reduce your rights will take effect immediately. If a change increases your obligations or reduces your rights, the change will take effect no earlier than one month after the change notice or with your acceptance.

The agreement continues with the modified content unless you terminate your Epassi service before the change takes effect. You have the right to terminate the agreement immediately as described in section I.13 until the announced effective date of the changes. Please note that you must also promptly inform your employer about the termination of your Epassi service.

Epassi has the right to terminate this agreement to end two (2) months after the termination.

You can also file a lawsuit in the district court of your domicile in Finland or the Helsinki District Court. If you do not have a domicile in Finland, the jurisdiction is the Helsinki District Court.

**II. Epassi Wallet**  

In addition to the Terms of Use of the Epassi service presented above, the following special terms apply to the functionalities of the Epassi Wallet.

You can load money into the Epassi Wallet as an OwnMoney balance. With the OwnMoney balance, you can pay for products and services in the network of Epassi Service Providers, provided that the payment method and Service Provider's system allows the use of OwnMoney. If the payment method and the Service Provider's system allows the use of OwnMoney, you can also use the OwnMoney balance for payments of employee and fringe benefits where the employer-provided benefit balance is less than the price of the Service to be purchased (i.e., the employer-provided benefit balance alone is not sufficient for the purchase).

**Paying with Other Balances in the Epassi Service**

As an Epassi user, you can link the points and/or balances of an Epassi Partner (e.g., Finnair) loyalty membership to the Epassi Wallet. With the points and/or balances, you can pay for products and services in the network of Epassi Service Providers. When paying with points, the Epassi Wallet automatically converts the points into a euro amount for the execution of the payment order in the ratio defined by the Partner and Epassi.

The functionalities of the Epassi Wallet are only available as part of the Epassi service and always require the simultaneous acceptance of the terms of the Epassi service.

Epassi Clearing Oy has a payment institution license granted by the Financial Supervisory Authority. The Financial Supervisory Authority supervises the operations of Epassi Clearing Oy: Financial Supervisory Authority, Snellmaninkatu 6, P.O. Box 103, 00101 Helsinki (www.fiva.fi).

**Additional definitions only concerning the Epassi Wallet**

* **Customer** means you, who have accepted the terms of use of Epassi and have activated the functionalities of the Epassi Wallet.
* The Epassi Wallet may be used by persons over the age of 15 who have funds under their control in a bank account provided by a Finnish bank.
* **Wallet payment** means a payment made to the Service Provider using the functionalities of the Epassi Wallet (such as OwnMoney balance or Partner service balance).
* **OwnMoney/OwnMoney balance** means the monetary amount you have transferred from your bank account to the Epassi service.

**II.1 Deployment**  
  
The agreement for the Epassi Wallet service is formed when you have accepted these Epassi terms of use and activate the functionalities of the Epassi Wallet for the first time.

You activate each functionality of the Epassi Wallet in the Epassi service by following the instructions for that functionality. Epassi and Epassi Clearing Oy reserve the unilateral right to change the content of each functionality or to suspend their provision at any chosen time.

The use of OwnMoney requires you to fulfill the identification obligations related to payment services (so-called KYC obligations).

The Epassi Wallet and the funds contained in it are only available as long as the user has a valid employment relationship with the current employer.

To use Wallet payments, you need:

* a Finnish personal identification number
* a smartphone (currently Android and iOS) or another mobile device with a phone subscription or an internet connection to use the web service
* a mobile phone number
* a Finnish bank account
* a strong electronic identification tool
* a valid email address

**II.2 Preparing and performing the Wallet Payments**  
  
You can make Wallet payments with the Epassi mobile application, phone number, NFC tag, or in online and other stores via the Epassi web service or payment button, which have indicated that they accept Wallet payments.

With the Epassi Wallet, you can make payments at the locations of Service Providers cooperating with Epassi Clearing Oy. Before that, you must load funds into the Epassi Wallet as an OwnMoney balance. The minimum transfer amount is 20 euros, with a daily maximum of 1,000 euros and an annual maximum of 20,000 euros. Clearing reserves the right to limit the funds transferred to the application and to make changes to the minimum and maximum transfer amounts.

You can make payments up to the amount of funds or balances visible in the application.

You can also make payments with accumulated loyalty points or other approved payment methods from Epassi Clearing Oy’s Partners. The loaded balance or available Partner points are visible in your Epassi Wallet.

It is not possible to convert Partner loyalty points or balances into cash in advance and then transfer them out of the Wallet. Instead, they are used at the time of purchase for the corresponding value. Refunds for services paid with Partner points or balances are returned as equivalent Partner points or balances.

If you wish to stop using the Epassi Wallet, you can request the return of your OwnMoney balance to the same bank account from which it was loaded.

The Epassi Wallet cannot be used for other bank transfers or payments beyond those described above.

**II.3 Payment transaction and balance information**  
  
In the Epassi web service and mobile application, you can view your current balances and all payments made with your credentials. OwnMoney loads to the Customer Fund Account are also visible in the web service.

**II.4 Notification about an incorrect payment transaction and unauthorised payments**  
  
You must regularly check the made payments from the Epassi Service, Bank Account transactions or the Partner’s service.

If you have accidentally made an incorrect payment to a service provider, you must notify the service provider without delay and no later than 13 months from the date the transaction was charged from your bank account or through the Partner's service.  
If a third party has made unauthorized transactions from your Epassi account, you must contact Epassi customer service, the service provider, or Epassi's Partner.

You will lose your right to receive compensation if you fail to submit the notification within a reasonable time.

(B) you have lost the mobile device with the downloaded Epassi app and/or the access IDs, they have ended up in the possession of an unauthorised party or are used in an unauthorised manner due to you acting carelessly; or

(C) you have not submitted the notifications mentioned above in section I.3 concerning the loss of the mobile device or Epassi Service IDs or the notification to the Partner concerning the loss of the payment processing information, the payment instrument ending up in the possession of an unauthorised third party or other unauthorised use without undue delay after observing it or immediately after the unauthorised use should have been observed when you have received the information about the implemented payments.

In cases referred above in subsections A and B, you are responsible for unauthorised payments up to EUR 50. However, this limitations does not apply if you have acted intentionally or by gross negligence.

However, you are not responsible for unauthorised payments made using the functionalities after submitting the report of loss.

You are, nevertheless, fully responsible for the payments if you have intentionally submitted an incorrect notification or acted otherwise deceitfully.

**II.5 MyMoney Balance refunds and service fees**

If you wish to stop using the Epassi Wallet, you can request a refund of your OwnMoney balance to the same bank account from which it was loaded. Epassi charges a fee of five (5) euros per refund transaction. Refunds under five (5) euros are not processed.
