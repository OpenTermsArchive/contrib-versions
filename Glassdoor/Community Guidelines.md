Community Guidelines
====================

Updated 21 March, 2025

**Our Promise**
===============

Glassdoor strives to be the most trusted and transparent place for candidates to search for jobs, research companies, and engage with our communities of professionals. Our Community Guidelines and moderation policies take into consideration applicable laws in the different international markets in which Glassdoor operates.

* **Anonymity & Free Speech:** We believe in the principles of anonymity and free speech—everyone has a right to voice their opinion and be heard without fear of retribution, censorship, or other unwanted attention.
    
* **We Don’t Edit Content:** We never edit or alter content submitted on our services.
    
* **We Welcome Positive & Negative Content:** We never suppress, filter, or delete content simply because it is negative/lower-rated, or positive/higher-rated. 
    
* **Naming Executives:** We allow content that names individuals in the highest positions in a company who have broad influence over the work environment, as long as the content describes the individual’s behavior or performance at work. Individuals in this category include those who are the public face of the company (C-Suite, Executive Director, President, Owner, Founder, etc.) We believe this information is generally representative of a company’s culture and can be informative to job candidates. We do not allow content that includes negative comments about identifiable individuals outside of this group.
    
* **Active Moderation:** With the help of our community, we actively moderate content and suspend users who do not respect our community guidelines or the professional nature of our services.
    
* **Glassdoor Is Neutral:** Glassdoor is a neutral platform for the content submitted by our users. We cannot make judgments about disputes over facts or opinions amongst our users and their current or former employers. We don’t know what happened or who is telling the truth. Therefore, we limit our moderation practices to compliance with these Guidelines. We stay neutral in all cases of dispute; we don’t take sides and we don’t act as the finder of fact with respect to reviewing content.
    
* **Review Standards:** We apply the same standard of review for all content (whether or not the content involves a client of Glassdoor).
    
* **Verification of Account(s)**: We require email verification from a permanent, active email address or a valid social networking account for each user submitting content. In some cases, we may 1) require users to confirm their account using an employer email address, or 2) attempt to verify their employment history or status through various methods, including third-party integrations or services.
    
* **Moderation Process:** We moderate content using proprietary technology that analyzes multiple attributes of the content for compliance with these Guidelines. If the content does not pass technological review, it is rejected and not made visible on our services. Additionally, a human moderates certain content that is flagged for a secondary review by our users.
    
* **Preventing Abuse and Gaming:** We use proprietary technology filters & algorithms to detect attempted abuse and gaming.

**Employer Pages & Reviews**
============================

In addition to our overall guidelines detailed above, Employer pages and reviews have the following additional guidelines:

  
**Review-Specific Guidelines**
---------------------------------

Millions of job seekers rely on Glassdoor's reviews and other user-submitted content to find jobs and companies they love. Follow these guidelines to ensure everyone can benefit from a helpful, balanced, and authentic community. 

* **Honest and Opinion-based**: Your review should be honest and constitute your own personal opinion and experience with your current or former employer. We don’t take sides when it comes to factual disputes, so we expect you to stand behind your statements expressed in your content.
* **One Review, Per Employer, Per Year:** Each individual is allowed one review, per employer, per year, per review type. If a user updates a review within a year, the older review will be archived and the newer review will be listed. Your content should be related to jobs you have held (or interviews you have had) within the last five years so it’s relevant to today’s job seeker.
* **Balanced is Recommended:** We encourage you to think about work from a few perspectives and include both a pro and a con to provide a balanced review. While not required, we do believe balanced reviews make for a better community experience.
* **Extreme Language:** We realize talking about work can get emotionally charged, but we don't approve reviews that include certain profanities, threats of violence, or discriminatory language targeted at an individual or group. We may allow reviews that mention race, religion, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, and the like if we believe the comment is used to describe a workplace situation. General discussions of workplace misconduct are allowed, including most discussions of illegal activities, discrimination, and sexual harassment.
* **Originality Required:** All reviews should be original, without substantial quoted material from other sources, including (but not limited to) websites, e-mail correspondence, other reviews, etc.
* **Professionally Irrelevant or Spam:** We also reject content that does not relate to an employer, is only a review of the product or service, or is otherwise not relevant to understanding workplace culture.
* **Content Quality:** Your writing doesn't have to be perfect, but we need to be able to understand it. We reject reviews for excessive capitalization or filler words/characters. And remember, your review will be more credible if you use good grammar, spelling, and punctuation.
* **Privacy:** To safeguard privacy, we do not allow you to identify yourself or include any contact information (about yourself or others) in your reviews.
* **Links:** Advertising, self-promotion, and other irrelevant links are not allowed in reviews.
* **Photos:** Do not post: 
    * Screenshots (Videoconferencing photos are allowed but cannot contain employee names, locations, images of minors, or anything in our sole discretion that we deem inappropriate.)
    * Photos of marketing material, logos, or websites
    * Portraits of individuals
    * Photos of patients in a healthcare setting
    * Photos not relevant to the employment setting
    * Incriminating photos of workplace violations
    * Copyrighted photos that you do not own 

\*Photo captions must also comply with our Guidelines

**Employer Response Guidelines**
--------------------------------

Employers may respond to reviews on Glassdoor. Employer responses are also moderated using the Guidelines, with the exception that we do allow employers to include their contact information and relevant web links (e.g. links to internal company policies, ethics/compliance hotline sites, etc.)

* **Incentivized or coerced content:** We remove content if we have evidence that users were incentivized to or coerced into leaving the content.
* **Right to respond:** We believe each employer has the right to respond to a review left by a user, and that the employer be given the last word on a review.
* **How Glassdoor defines workers and employers:** Glassdoor uses the term ‘worker’ to describe any individual who has delivered work product for a company and/or is a significant part of an employer’s value chain. These workers can be full-time, part-time, contractors, freelancers, independent, 1099, interns, or similar. In addition, Glassdoor uses the term ‘employer’ to describe the entity that employs workers and/or provides the opportunity for workers to make a living. We may also use the term ‘employer’ to describe an official company representative; this may be someone in HR or recruiting, marketing, or a member of the senior leadership team.

**When responding, please:**

* Be courteous and professional.
* Do not include the name of the individual you believe wrote the review.
* Do not threaten the writer of a review with legal or other punitive damage.
* Note that Glassdoor moderates employer responses after they have posted. Therefore, if the response does not meet the guidelines, it may be shown for a short time before we remove it. (You will be notified by email if we remove your response.)

**Important Information**

* We love it when companies encourage their employees and job candidates to share honest reviews on Glassdoor, but do not offer incentives in exchange for reviews. We will remove positive reviews where we have evidence that employees were compensated and/or coerced into leaving a review. Glassdoor believes in anonymity, so we don’t allow employers to ask workers to show confirmation of posting on Glassdoor.
