MDN Plus Privacy Notice
=======================

Version 1.2, Effective November 1, 2023

At Mozilla, we design products with your privacy in mind.
---------------------------------------------------------

MDN Plus is a subscription service providing premium functionality. MDN Plus is aimed at providing developers with a customized experience on MDN, increasing their productivity and making their day to day more successful.

This privacy notice explains what data MDN Plus collects, shares, and why. We also adhere to the [Mozilla Privacy Policy](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/) for how we receive, handle, and share information.

Things you should know:
-----------------------

### Information we collect

**Mozilla account information.** This service requires a Mozilla account, which provides MDN Plus read-only access to your Mozilla account profile information, for example your user ID, display name, avatar, email address, locale, and active product subscriptions. Learn more about [Mozilla account data practices](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/firefox/#firefox-accounts-join-firefox).

**MDN Plus account information.** When you use MDN Plus features, we receive the data required to provide those features to you. For instance, if you set saved pages, we receive your saved pages.

**Location information.** MDN Plus receives your IP address when you sign up for and use the service. We use the IP address in order to approximate your location because MDN Plus is currently only available in certain countries.

**Payment information.** When you subscribe to MDN Plus, you will send payment through one of our third-party payment providers: Stripe, Apple, PayPal, or Google Pay. Mozilla receives a record of your account (including your billing address and the last four digits of your payment method) and the status of your account’s subscription. Mozilla does not store your full payment details.

**Interaction data.** Mozilla receives data about your interactions with MDN Plus, including when you log in and when you make changes to your Mozilla account like changing your email address or product subscriptions.

**Technical data.** Mozilla receives basic information from MDN Plus about the web browser you’re using and the operating system it’s running on. When MDN Plus connects to our servers to authenticate and update your MDN Plus account, your IP address is temporarily collected as part of our server logs.

We use the data to improve performance and stability for our users, and to measure MDN Plus' performance.

MDN Plus doesn’t share any of your data with third parties.
