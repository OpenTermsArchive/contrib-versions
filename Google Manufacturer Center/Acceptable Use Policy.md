Manufacturer Center policy requirements
=======================================

[Manufacturer Center](http://manufacturers.google.com/) allows you to provide more accurate information about your products for use in Shopping ads and listings, and across other Google services. After you've set up an account, you can submit data files, as well as enrich and curate your product data. Bear in mind that the use of data uploaded to Manufacturer Center can be restricted depending on the program it is used for.

There are several program requirements for using Manufacturer Center.

*   Only manufacturers may set up a Manufacturer Center account. We define manufacturers as brand manufacturers, brand owners or retailers of own-brand products who both manufacture products and own the licensing rights.
*   Manufacturer Center is not available to retailers who sell products exclusively from other manufacturers
*   The account requestor has to be verified as an employee of the parent company

If you are a retailer not selling your own brands and would like to list items for sale in Shopping ads, you may do so using the [Merchant Center](https://merchants.google.com/). Note that separate [policy requirements apply](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6149970) to use of the Merchant Center.
