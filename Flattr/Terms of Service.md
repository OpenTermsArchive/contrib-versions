**6\. FLATTR USERS’ USE OF SERVICE**

Flattring: To flattr a Site a Flattr User must click on a Button displayed on the Site, in on flattr.com or via a service offering flattr integration. (“flattring”, “flattred” or “flattr”). You can only flattr the same Button once per calendar month. Any additional clicks on a Button in the same calendar month will not be valid. To be eligible to flattr in a given calendar month, a Flattr User must:

(i) have a valid Flattr User Account;

(ii) place funds into his Flattr User Account following the relevant instructions on the Flattr Site (“Flattring Amount”).

(iii) allocate from the Flattring Amount the monthly contribution for flattring of Sites (“Monthly Contribution”);

(iv) at least once in that calendar month log onto the Flattr Site and click at least one Button on the Network.

Trust Account: Each Flattr User agrees that all Flattring Amounts are held on trust by Flattr for the benefit of Site Owners, charities and other non-profit organisations and authorises Flattr to allocate and disburse the Flattring Amounts according to these Terms. All Flattring Amounts will be disbursed to the Site Owners, in which case Flattr will take a Flattr Fee (defined below). Each Flattr User agrees that Flattr may act as a paid commercial agent of the Site Owners. Monthly Contribution: A Flattr User can change the Monthly Contribution at any time before the end of the calendar month provided that the Monthly Contribution is not less than €2. Individual Contribution: A Flattr User’s individual contribution to each Site Owner is determined by taking his Monthly Contribution and dividing it by the number of individual Buttons he has flattred during the calendar month (“Individual Contribution”).

Transaction Fees: Any fees, foreign exchange or penalties charged by any payment providers or processors in relation to the Flattring Amount are the Flattr User’s sole responsibility.

NO REFUNDS AND NO REDEMPTION: THERE ARE NO REFUNDS AND NO REDEMPTION OF THE FLATTRING AMOUNTS PLACED ON TRUST WITH FLATTR EXCEPT AS DETERMINED BY FLATTR AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION. ANY FLATTRING AMOUNTS PLACED IN A FLATTR USER ACCOUNT CANNOT BE WITHDRAWN.

Distributions: If during a given month a Flattr User has not flattred any Sites, their Monthly Contribution will remain on the users trust account. If the Flattr User has not flattred any Sites for six (6) months, Flattr has a right to take any Flattring Amount remaining on his Flattr User Account less the Trustee Fee and any other applicable fees and distribute it to one or more charities or other non-profit organisations of Flattr’s choice or otherwise dispose of it as permitted under applicable law. All Trustee Fees will be retained by Flattr and any other applicable fees will be paid as appropriate.

Termination of Flattr User Account: If a Flattr user terminates his account any Flattring Amount remaining on his Flattr User Account less the Trustee Fee and any other applicable fees and distribute it to one or more charities or other non-profit organisations of Flattr’s choice or otherwise dispose of it as permitted under applicable law.

Ability to Flattr: A Flattr User’s ability to Flattr will be suspended if the Flattring Amount in his Flattr User Account reaches €0. See our http://flattr.com/support/faq for details. If a Flattr User Ability to Flattr is suspended as described above the Flattr User can reactivate his Flattr User Account by adding more funds.Once the Flattr User Account is reactivated, the Flattr User can change the Monthly Contribution at any time before the end of the calendar month provided that the Monthly Contribution is not less than €2.

If the Flattr User has not reactivated his account after six (6) months, Flattr may distribute any Flattring Amount remaining on his Flattr User Account to one or more charities (or other non-profit organisations) of Flattr’s choice or otherwise dispose of it as permitted under applicable law.

Your Flattr User Account and Activity Will Remain Viewable: Even after a Flattr User Account has been terminated or suspended, any previous flattring activity will be viewable by all Flattr Users for historical financial tracking and other purposes. Flattr reserves the right to store and share all flattring activity subject to the Privacy Policy (defined in clause 8).

**7\. SITE OWNERS’ USE OF BUTTON**

Placement / Modification of Button: Each Button has a unique tracking code. A Site Owner may (i) duplicate and install it with the same tracking code either throughout his Site, which may include but is not limited to a website, blog or service, or across his Sites, or (ii) use separate Buttons with unique tracking codes for different pages or sections of his Site(s).

Commercial Agent: Each Site Owner authorises Flattr to be his commercial agent (as defined in regulation 2(1) of the Commercial Agents (Council Directive) Regulations 1993 SI 1993/3053) with the power to negotiate and collect Flattring Amounts on his behalf in accordance with these Terms and agrees to Flattr acting as a commercial agent of all other Site Owners in accordance with these Terms. Each Site Owner in his capacity as the principle of Flattr agrees that Flattr can act as a trustee pursuant to these Terms. No Misguiding: The name of a Site a Site Owner chooses to assign to a Button must be consistent with the actual webpage where the Button is displayed and must not be an attempt to mislead users or visitors into thinking the Site is a different site or that the Button is associated with a different site.

Licence and Restrictions: If a Site Owner submits a URL, connects a service or installs a Button on his Site, he warrants that he or the entity he is legally authorised to represent owns or has been granted the appropriate licence to all intellectual property rights relating to the URL submitted or used for the button and/or content on the connected service.

Button: All rights, titles and interests in and to any Button, including but not limited to all intellectual property rights, are the exclusive property of Flattr. Each Site Owner acknowledges and agrees that the Buttons are provided by a non-exclusive licence, and not sold or transferred, as part of the Service and that he will not use them for any use other than his permitted use of the Service. There is no cost to license Buttons but their use is subject to these Terms and a Site Owner may only use and display a Button if he has a valid Flattr User Account.

Flattring Proceeds: Each Site Owner who has been flattred at least once per calendar month will be eligible to receive funds in his Flattr User Account (“Flattring Proceeds”) for that calendar month based upon the following formula: Flattering Proceeds equal the sum of the Individual Contributions of each Flattr User who flattrs the Site Owner’s Site(s) during that calendar month (“Sum”) less 10% of the Sum (“Flattr Fees”). Flattr receives and retains Flattr Fees from Site Owners in consideration for providing the Service to them and for its services as their commercial agent.

AUTOMATIC TRANSFER OF FLATTRING PROCEEDS: IF A SITE OWNER’S FLATTRING AMOUNT (WHICH HE ALLOCATED IN HIS CAPACITY AS A FLATTR USER) FALLS BELOW HIS CHOSEN MONTHLY CONTRIBUTION, FLATTR WILL TRANSFER FROM HIS FLATTERING PROCEEDS THE AMOUNT NECESSARY TO INCREASE HIS FLATTRING AMOUNT TO HIS CHOSEN MONTHLY CONTRIBUTION. AS DESCRIBED IN CLAUSE 6 ABOVE, ANY FLATTRING AMOUNT, INCLUDING ANY TRANSFERRED FLATTRING AMOUNT, CANNOT BE REFUNDED OR REDEEMED. A FLATTR USER CAN CHANGE THE MONTHLY CONTRIBUTION AT ANY TIME BEFORE THE END OF THE CALENDAR MONTH PROVIDED THAT THE MONTHLY CONTRIBUTION IS NOT LESS THAN €2.

Breaching the Agreement: Flattr reserves the right to withhold the Flattring Proceeds (defined below) or other amounts due to a Site Owner if there is any suspected breach of these Terms by the Site Owner, pending reasonable investigation by Flattr.

Allocation of Flattring Proceeds: Flattring Proceeds for a calendar month will be allocated to Site Owners within ten (10) business days of the end of that calendar month by crediting them to the Site Owner’s Flattr User Account (“Allocation”). Flattr will not pay for any payment processing fees, including but not limited to the fees associated with collecting money from Flattr Users, disbursing the Flattring Proceeds and any currency conversion, and, if necessary, any such fees will be deducted from the relevant Flattring Proceeds prior to the Allocation. Flattr reserves the right to vary the Flattr Fees at any time.

Disbursement of Flattring Proceeds: Each month Site Owners will have three options for disbursing the Flattring Proceeds. They may either: (i) instruct Flattr to transfer the Flattring Proceeds to the Site Owner’s Designated Account. (ii) instruct Flattr to allocate the Flattring Proceeds as their Flattring Amount subject to the restrictions and obligations of Flattr Users as set out in these Terms. or (iii) do a combination of (i) and (ii) above. Any such instructions should be noted in the Flattr dashboard. If Flattr does not receive any disbursement instructions from a Site Owner before the end of a calendar month, Flattr will transfer the Site Owner’s Flattring Proceeds for that calendar month to the Site Owner’s Designated Account subject to these Terms and to any Automatic Transfer of Flattring Proceeds as described in this clause above.

ANY FLATTRING PROCEEDS A SITE OWNER INSTRUCTS FLATTR TO ALLOCATE AS A FLATTRING AMOUNT ARE NON-REFUNDABLE AND NON-REDEEMABLE.

Any movement of funds and any disbursements by Flattr may be subject to compliance, regulatory or anti-money laundering requirements and as such may be subject to delays. Flattr will try to ensure that the Site Owner’s Designated Account is credited with the Flattring Proceeds in accordance with these Terms within ten (10) business days of the date of the relevant Allocation.

In the event that a Site Owner’s Flattr User Account is terminated and subject to these Terms, Flattr will disburse to the Site Owner’s Designated Account all Flattring Proceeds accumulated in the Site Owner’s Flattr User Account that have not been allocated as Flattring Amounts less any amounts due to Flattr as Flattr Fees or otherwise.

Tax Obligations: Flattr is not responsible for the reporting, collection, calculation or payment of any taxes applicable to Flattr Users or Site Owners whatsoever. Each Flattr User and Site Owner is solely responsible for the collection and payment of any such taxes and for the provision and maintenance of all necessary information and records associated with their Flattr User Accounts.

Maintenance of the Designated Account: It is the sole responsibility of the Site Owner to maintain updated and correct contact information and provide a valid and active Designated Account for receiving disbursements. Failure to do so will relieve Flattr of any obligation to disburse the Site Owner’s Flattring Proceeds. If such information is not updated for a period of six (6) months or more, the Site Owner is deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that Flattr may without further notice disburse to one or more charities or other non-profit organisations of Flattr’s choice or otherwise dispose of it as permitted under applicable law any Flattring Proceeds accumulated in the Site Owner’s Flattr User Account that have not been allocated as Flattring Amounts less any amounts due to Flattr as Flattr Fees or otherwise and less any fees that may arise on disbursement.

Suspending or Canceling a Button by Site Owners: Buttons cannot be cancelled since they contain historical traffic and financial information that must be preserved. However, a Site Owner may remove a Button from any or all of his pages for any reason and at any time. This involves deleting the Button’s JavaScript, static HTML code or similar programming from the site. When a Site Owner removes a Button from his site, the listing and button on the Flattr Site may not be removed automatically. To ensure they are removed, the Site Owner must use the “delete thing” function found on the Flattr Site.

You understand and agree that any historical activity and information of any Site Owner’s Site will not be removed from the Flattr Site.
