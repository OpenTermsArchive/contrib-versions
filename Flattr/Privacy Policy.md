Privacy Information: Voluntary opt in to send anonymized data to us

We are continuously improving the Extension. If you want to support us in improving the Extension, you can allow the Extension to transfer the above mentioned data to Flattr and eyeo GmbH by explicitly opting in to such a transfer. Depending on the status of our improvement, we may need different data. Such data will be restricted to the data listed in the Declaration of Consent and will be only transferred if you opt in to provide us with beta feedback. Please find the respective Declaration of Consent here. You can opt out from this at any time in the settings of the Flattr extension.

Anonymization of your data when providing feedback

In order to protect your personal data, all URLs, page titles, domains (except the ones stated below) and authors of the content viewed on the respective domain will be replaced by an increasing series of numbers before sending the information to our servers, which are protected by TLS encryption. Thus, we do not know what you have been surfing, only the fact that you have been surfing.

Because we might develop customized solutions for multi-author platforms in order to pay out the respective author that has been flattered, the domains (and only the domains, not the URLs) of multi-author platforms, as but not limited to Youtube.com and Wordpress.com (full list here), will not be replaced by an increasing series of numbers.

We do not combine the collected data with any other information about you. The data we collect is statistical data, therefore we do not know who generated it.
