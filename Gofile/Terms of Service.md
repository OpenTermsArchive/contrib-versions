Terms of Service
================

1\. Introduction
----------------

The terms under which WOJTEK SAS / Gofile offers its services to users are described in this contract. By registering and using our services or accessing our websites, you accept these terms without reservation. We reserve the right to deny access to our services to anyone who could harm their integrity.

2\. Service Description
-----------------------

The Gofile Service is intended for users who wish to store digital content of any kind on Gofile servers. It offers a storage service that allows the public communication of content and is considered a hosting service under applicable legislation. Users can also store content in a private space. Gofile is then a simple storage service provider. Any content communicated to the public in violation of third-party rights may be removed in accordance with Gofile's terms and the laws in force.

3\. Service Registration
------------------------

In order to use the Service other than as a "guest," the user must provide an email address. They will receive a link to access the service. No other information is required.

4\. Offer and Payment
---------------------

Gofile offers a free and paid mode.  
The free offer is provided in the form of Freemium, which means that the user can use and test a deliberately degraded service for free, including displaying advertisements, and eventually decide to subscribe to a paid offer. Users can access the free offer as a guest or as a standard user, each with its own features. To access the services as a guest, the user does not need to identify themselves; a guest session is automatically created upon the first connection to the site. This session is ephemeral and mainly allows for quick sharing. To access the services as a standard user, the user must provide a valid email address on which they will receive a connection link. The user agrees that Gofile will keep their email (which serves as an identifier). The user agrees that the use of services as a guest and standard user involves displaying advertising offers.  
The user can choose to subscribe to the paid offer to access additional features and services described in the "subscription" tab of the profile page. They can customize their offer according to their specific needs and proceed with payment among the proposed modes. Once payment is made, the order is final and the user will receive a confirmation email containing the information mentioned during the order validation process.

5\. The User
------------

Gofile's services are available to any adult individual with legal capacity. The user guarantees that the information they provide is true, accurate, current, and complete and undertakes to update it to maintain its accuracy. If any of the information provided is false, inaccurate, expired, or incomplete, we reserve the right to suspend or close the user's account and cancel this agreement without the potential prejudice being able to be repaired. The user is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their identifiers and is responsible for any activity on their account. If the user notices any activity indicating that their account is being used in an unauthorized manner or that their data is being used without their permission, they should immediately contact us. Gofile, as a data controller, implements automated data processing for managing its website and providing the service. The data collected is necessary for this processing and is intended for the services provided by Gofile and, if applicable, by its subcontractors and providers. Any person using Gofile's services can consult the page relating to the use of personal data.

6\. Legal Provisions
--------------------

The user is responsible for the data stored on Gofile servers. We provide the user with methods of restricting and controlling access for better control of their data. We recommend for maximum security to encrypt the data before storing it on our servers. The user recognizes Gofile's hosting status and cannot hold Gofile responsible for the content stored by the user.

You agree not to use our services to:

*   Broadcast, send, or transmit any content that incites hatred or refers to torture or death.
*   Cause harm to minors, especially by disseminating child pornography.
*   Broadcast, display, or transmit any content that would violate patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, or any other property right belonging to a third party.
*   Send unsolicited commercial emails (“spam”).
*   Hide identity to perform illegal, fraudulent, or infringing activities on intellectual property rights of a third party; broadcasting harmful, illegal, or defamatory content.
*   Allow others to use our services illegally, invasively, prejudicially, defamatory, or fraudulently; to alter, steal, corrupt, disable, destroy, illegally access or violate any computer file, database, or network security or encryption; to interfere with the use of our network by other authorized clients or users; violate the use conditions of Gofile's infrastructure providers, provided that you are aware of these policies and that they are publicly available on the websites of the infrastructure providers; or in a manner that is contrary to generally accepted internet etiquette.
*   Try to gain access to an account or computer resource that does not belong to you, without the owner's permission.
*   Interfere with the use or enjoyment of our network or any other service by other authorized clients or users. This includes excessive use that damages fair use by other users and clients of Gofile.

We reserve the right to terminate any account that violates these rules, without notice, in accordance with the laws and policies established by Gofile as a hosting service. Furthermore, if the user violates these rules, we will fully cooperate with authorities by providing information about the user and content.

7\. Refund Policy and Legal Withdrawal Period
---------------------------------------------

\- Refund: As the services offered by Gofile are digital in nature, most of the time they cannot be refunded. However, each case will be evaluated on an individual basis, and a refund may be granted if the reason for the request is deemed legitimate (such as an error from Gofile, a technical problem, or a payment made by mistake).  
\- Legal Withdrawal Period: By accepting the terms and conditions as a consumer, the user acknowledges that the 14-day period for exercising the right of withdrawal does not apply when the services have already been provided.

8\. Delayed / Default Payment

--------------

12\. Modification of the Agreement or our Services
--------------------------------------------------

We reserve the right to modify the terms of use at any time and without notice. In addition, in case of force majeure, we reserve the right to modify or interrupt the service, temporarily or permanently, without notice. You acknowledge that we cannot be held responsible for any modification, suspension, or interruption of the service. In order to protect the integrity of the services, you acknowledge our right to establish conditions and limitations for the use of the service, including the maximum disk space allocated on our servers and the maximum number of times (and maximum duration) you can access the service within a given time period. The rates are freely fixed and can be modified without notice. These limitations may be reviewed in light of market changes imposed on Gofile.

13\. Termination
