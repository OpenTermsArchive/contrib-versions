Website Cookie Statement
========================

Last Updated: August 27, 2021

This Cookie Statement explains how Magnite and its affiliates (collectively “**Magnite**”, “**we**“, “**us**“, and “**ours**“) use cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our websites at magnite.com (“**Website**“).  It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

**What are cookies?**

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used in order to make websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.

Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Magnite) are called “first party cookies.”  Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies.”  Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the Website (e.g. like interactive content and analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the Website and also when it visits certain other websites.

**What cookies do we use?**

We use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites to operate. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Websites. We may also use cookies for analytics or other purposes.

The specific types of first and third party cookies set through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in the table below.

**What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?**

Cookies are not the only way to recognise or track visitors to a website.  We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called “tracking pixels” or “clear gifs”).  These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enables us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or opened an email that we have sent them.  This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns.  In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.

| **Types of cookies** | **Who sets these cookies** |
| **Essential website cookies:** These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our Websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. | Magnite |
| **Performance and functionality cookies:** These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our Websites but are non-essential to their use.  However, without these cookies, certain functionality may become unavailable. | [Sumo](https://sumo.com/tos) |
| **Analytics and customisation cookies:** These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our Websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customise our Websites for you. | [Marketo](https://documents.marketo.com/legal/privacy/)  <br>[Google Analytics](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en_US%5C)  <br>[Sumo](https://sumo.com/tos)  <br>[Wistia](https://wistia.com/privacy)  <br>[Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/privacy) |
| **Advertising cookies:** These cookies are used by third parties to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed for advertisers, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. | [Demandbase](https://www.demandbase.com/privacy-policy/) |

**Do you serve targeted advertising?**

We do not serve targeted advertising on our Websites. 

We do provide targeted advertising services to advertisers and publishers who use our Platform, however. Please see our [Platform Cookie Statement](https://www.magnite.com/legal/platform-cookie-statement/) for more information about targeted advertising served through our Platform and [Your Opt-Out Choices](https://www.magnite.com/legal/platform-cookie-statement/#Your-Opt-Out-Choices).

**How can I control cookies?**

You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.  You can exercise your cookie preferences by following the opt-out instructions below.

**Your Opt-Out Choices**

Because the effect of “Do Not Track” signals remains unclear, and there continues to be no consistent industry understanding of how to respond to such a signal, we do not alter our privacy practices when we detect a “Do Not Track” signal from your browser.

You can accept or refuse non-essential cookies from the Website through the cookie banner when you visit our Website or at any time by activating settings on your browser.  Information about the procedure to follow in order to enable or disable cookies through your browser can be found on your Internet browser provider’s website via your help screen.  You may wish to refer to [https://www.youronlinechoices.com/](https://www.youronlinechoices.com/) for information on commonly used browsers.  Please be aware that if cookies are disabled, some website features may not operate as intended.

Please note that opt outs operate by placing a cookie on your device that is unique to the browser and device you use to opt out. They may not function properly if you have configured your browser to reject certain cookies. If you change browsers or devices, or delete the cookies on your device, you will need to opt out again. You also can set your browser to notify you when a cookie is being set and to block most cookies, including ours.

**How often will you update this Cookie Statement?**

We may update this Cookie Statement from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.  Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Statement regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.

The date at the top of this Cookie Statement indicates when it was last updated.
