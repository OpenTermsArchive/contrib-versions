**1\. Using the Bolt app**

1.1 Bolt provides an information society service through Bolt app that enables mediation of the requests for transport services between the passengers and drivers and Bolt does not provide transport services. Transport Services are provided by Fleet Partners /Drivers, on the basis of a contract with you for the carriage of passengers (“Transportation Contract”). They provide transport services on an independent basis as economic and professional carriers. Bolt is not responsible in any way for the fulfilment of the contract entered into between the passenger (you) and the driver. Please note that all disputes arising from or in connection with the Transportation Contract will be resolved between you and Fleet Partners / Drivers as may be the case. The Transportation Contract enters into force with the acceptance of your order by the Fleet Partner via Bolt App according to the agreement between you and the Fleet Partner.

1.2 Data regarding the Fleet Partners, the Drivers and their Transport Service is available in the Bolt App and receipts for journeys are sent to the email address listed in passenger’s profile.

1.3 When using the Bolt App, you can choose whether to pay directly to the Fleet Partner / Driver for the Transport Service (in cash) or use Bolt in-App Payment. Payments for Bolt Business rides are handled by a separate agreement for Business journeys. Fares will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Fees may include other applicable fees, without limitation, tolls, and/or surcharges including a booking fee and cancellation fee, municipal tolls, airport surcharges or processing fees for split payments. If you wish, you may also choose to pay a tip to the driver directly or via the use of Bolt in-App Payment. We may limit the maximum value of a tip at our sole discretion.

1.4 The use of Bolt App requires the installation of the mobile application, the registration of a user account and the acceptance of these GTC. During the installation of Bolt App, the passenger’s mobile number is linked to the respective Bolt user account and added to our database. If you are no longer using this mobile number, you must notify Bolt Ireland within seven (7) days so we can anonymize your account data. If you do not notify us about any change to your number, your mobile operator might assign your previous mobile number to another person who later by using Bolt app will be able to see your data.

**2\. Promotional Codes**

2.1 Bolt Ireland, or Bolt Group Companies, may send you promotional codes on a per promotion basis. Promotional code credit can be applied towards payment on completion of a ride or other features or benefits related to the Transport Service and/or a Third Party’s service and are subject to any additional terms that are established on a per promotional code basis. Expiration dates of promotional codes will be reflected in-app once you have applied the promotional code to your account.

2.2 If your trip amount exceeds the redeemable credit allocated to your ride, the balance will be automatically deducted from your account’s payment method. Similarly, a promotional code credit only applies on a per ride basis and cannot be carried over to the next ride/ trip and therefore will be forfeited. Only one promotional code may be applied per trip.

2.3 Bolt Ireland reserves the right to cancel any promotional code at any time for any reason. This includes, but is not limited to, if Bolt Ireland deems that promotion codes are being used in an unlawful or fraudulent manner, those issued mistakenly, and those which have expired.

You, as a passenger are responsible for ensuring that the payment takes place and ensuring that sufficient funds are available.

3.2 When making payments by Bolt in-App Payment, your payments are received and forwarded to the Fleet Partner, and the Payment Agent forwards only the amounts to the Fleet Partner. Bolt Ireland may ask additional data from you to verify payment method. You may choose to pay a tip to the driver using the Bolt In-app Payment service. The tip can be paid via the In-app Payment by means authorised by Bolt for that purpose. Bolt will not hold a commission for the brokerage of the tip and the tip will be transferred to the driver in full amount, excluding any taxes, if applicable. Bolt reserves the right to withhold the Tip, if the payment of the tip is suspected as being fraudulent, illegal, for a purpose other than as a gratuity related to the service provided or used in conflict with Bolt’s Terms and Conditions.

3.3 When making payments by Bolt in-App Payment for transport services, Bolt Ireland, Bolt Group Companies, Bolt Partners are not responsible for possible third-party payment costs (mobile operators, bank fees etc). These service providers may charge you additional fees when processing payments in connection with the Bolt in-App Payment.

3.5 Upfront Fare. ​You may be offered to use a ride option that allows you to agree to a fixed Fare for a given instance of Transportation service provided by the Fleet Partner / Driver (i.e Upfront Fare). Upfront Fare is communicated to you via the Bolt App before the ride is requested. Upfront Fare shall not be applied if you change the destination during the ride, the ride takes materially longer than estimated due to traffic or other factors, or when other unexpected circumstances impact the characteristics of the ride materially (e.g a route is used where tolls apply).

**4\. Ordering and cancelling transport services**

4.1 If you order a Transport Service and the Fleet Partner has agreed to the request then the transport service is considered to be ordered, and you will enter into a separate Transport Contract with the Fleet Partner on such terms and conditions as you agree with the latter. Bolt Ireland does not provide journeys and is not a party to your Transport Contract with the relevant Fleet Partner.

4.2 Cancelling the use of an ordered Transport Service which has been accepted by the Fleet Partner is considered to be the situation where your request was accepted by the Fleet Partner and you subsequently reject, cancel or refuse the transport service. When a Transport Service is cancelled after certain time period determined in Bolt App, you are required to pay a cancellation fee.

4.3 If you cancel a Transport Service request on multiple successive instances within 24-hour we may temporarily block your account for warning. After multiple such warnings, we may suspend your account for longer period (eg: 6 month). After that period you could ask to reactivate your account and your application will be reviewed.

4.4 When the Driver / Fleet Partner notifies the Passenger about the arrival of the vehicle to its destination and the passenger or people for whom the transport was ordered do not arrive at the vehicle within certain time period as specified in the Bolt app, the request will be deemed cancelled. Sometimes your request may be cancelled by the transport service provider. Please note that Bolt Ireland is not responsible for such situations
