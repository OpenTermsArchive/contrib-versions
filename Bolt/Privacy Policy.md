| ****Geolocation Data**** | We collect data about your precise and/or approximate geolocation (including GPS, and IP address) from your mobile device depending on your app settings and device permissions, when you open and use the Bolt App. You may use the Bolt App without enabling collection of Geolocation Data from your mobile device. This may affect some features on the Bolt App and you may have, for example, to enter your pickup address. |
| ****App Usage Data**** | We collect personal data via the Bolt App about your use of the Bolt services. This includes: details of journeys (date and time, pick-up and drop-off addresses, journey distances and routes), payment history (including whether you used any coupons or promotional codes), cancellation history, dates and times you log-in and log-off the Bolt App and app features or pages viewed, browser type, app crashes and other system activity. |
| ****Communication Data**** | We collect communication and correspondence data when you engage with our Customer Support Team via the in-app chat function, report an incident, communicate via emails, web forms, or speak with our Customer Support agents, or communicate with Drivers via the Bolt App using the in-app chat function or via internet calls (where available). We record the date and time of the communications and its content and your phone number (where you use the call feature). We will record calls, only where you are notified in advance that the call may be recorded. In the markets where we facilitate phone calls and text messages between Drivers and Passengers without sharing either party’s actual phone number with the other, we protect your personal data by using a masked numbers application. |
| ****User Generated Data**** | We collect personal data when you use certain features. For example to provide recordings such as audio recordings generated during the trip (as part of our safety toolkit trip audio recording feature, where such feature is available - for more information, please visit https://bolt.eu/en-ie/blog/new-audio-trip-recording-feature), or to submit content like pictures, videos, files in connection with a Customer Support request or ratings or feedback about other users, including compliments that you have the option to give to Drivers, when you finish your ride, along with a 5 star review. This also includes metadata relating to the method you use to communicate with Bolt. |

For example, to remind you of scheduled rides and get alerts to order a ride for your upcoming trip. |
| ****Cookies, SDKs, Analytics, and Third-Party Technologies Data**** | We collect information through the use of cookies, tracking pixels, data analytics tools, SDKs, and other third-party technologies like advertising IDs to understand how you navigate through the Bolt App, to make your experience safer, to improve your site and Bolt App experience, to serve you better ads on other sites (according to your marketing preferences), and to save your preferences.

This includes your:<br><br>\- Full name<br><br>\- Email address<br><br>\- Phone number |
| ****Rider Rating Data**** | We collect ratings and feedback via comments about you from Drivers after each trip. Drivers are required to rate a Passenger from 1 to 5 stars, based on their trip experience and where a Driver assigns a low score to a Passenger (1-3 Stars), the Driver will be required to provide mandatory feedback for that Passenger. Your average Rider Rating is calculated based on the total sum of your ratings divided by the total number of journeys over a 365 day period and is accessible to you in the Bolt App. The rating will be linked to your account and only your average Rider Rating will be visible to Drivers in the Bolt App when they accept a journey. If we find out the rating or comment is not given in good faith, this rating or comment may not be included in the calculation of your rating |

4\. What purposes do we use your personal data for and what is our legal basis for processing?

The table below sets out:

* our purpose for processing your personal data;
* our legal grounds (known as a ‘legal basis’) under data protection law, for each purpose; and

Here is a general explanation of each ‘legal basis’ that Bolt relies on to process your personal data to help you understand the table below:

* ****Performance of a Contract****: When it is necessary for Bolt (or a third party) to process your personal data to provide you with the Bolt services we promised you and meet our obligations under the Terms and Conditions for Passengers. Where the legal basis for processing your personal data is performance of a contract, and you choose not to provide the information, you may be unable to use the Bolt services.

If you would like more information about this (including the balancing test), please contact us using the methods set out in Section 2 “__How do you contact us?__” above. In countries where legitimate interest is not an available lawful basis for Bolt’s processing activities, we will instead rely on an alternative valid legal basis.-

Withdrawal of the consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing which took place prior to you giving your consent to us.
* ****Compliance with Legal Obligations****: When we must process your personal data to comply with a law or regulation in the markets we operate in, such as to comply with our licensing conditions and our obligations under tax and accounting laws. Where the legal basis for processing your personal data is compliance with legal obligations, and you choose not to provide the information, you may be unable to use the Bolt services.

When we process your personal data for a new purpose different from the purpose your personal data was originally collected for and we haven’t asked for your consent, we will have to ensure that this new purpose is compatible with the initial purpose we collected it for. We will take into account any link between the two purposes and decide if the personal data can be used for this new purpose. Otherwise, we will take appropriate steps to ask for your consent or refrain from processing your personal data.### 5. Who do we share your personal data with?

We may share your personal data with the following categories of recipients.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ****Category of Recipients**** | ****Description**** |
| ****Bolt Group Companies and partners**** | We may share your personal data with our Bolt Group Companies (including Bolt local subsidiaries), third party partners, their affiliates and representatives, who may use your personal data in the manner described in this Notice. If Bolt local subsidiaries are responsible for processing your personal data, they may share your personal data with Bolt Operations OU as the main data controller for Bolt. |
| ****Drivers**** | Your personal data is only disclosed to the Drivers (whether acting on their own behalf as an independent service provider, or acting on behalf of another service provider (for example, acting on behalf of a fleet or another individual)) when you engage with a ride in the Bolt App; in such a case, the Driver will see your name, phone number (in many countries the number is masked), pickup, destination and geolocation data. Once the ride is finished, we also share ratings and feedback with the Driver. (We remove your identity associated with ratings and feedback when we share it with Drivers). After providing the transportation service, your name and the telephone number will remain visible to the Driver for 24-48 hours. This is necessary for Drivers to resolve any issues with you like getting something special back to you which might have been left in the car. Depending on your location, and if our audio recording safety feature is available, we may also share an audio recording initiated by a Driver with the Driver or law enforcement authorities. |
| ****Bolt Business Clients or other Passengers**** | Some rides you take may be requested or paid for by others. If you take one of those rides using the Bolt Business Profile account of your employer, a code or coupon, a corporate credit card linked to another account, or another user or entity otherwise requests or pays a ride for you, we may share your ride details with that other party, including your name, phone number, the date, time, charge, rating given, region of trip, and pick up and drop off locations of your ride. The data shared with Bolt Business Clients will be disclosed via reports they can access on their Business Accounts. Processing of personal data will occur under the same conditions as established in this Notice. |
| ****Referrers**** | If you refer someone to the Bolt App, we will let them know that you generated the referral. If another user referred you, we may share information about your use of the Platform with that user. For example, a referral source may receive a bonus when you join the Bolt App or complete a certain number of rides and would receive such information. |
| ****Promotional, marketing and strategic partners**** | We may share limited data like your email address with our promotional, marketing and strategic partners so that they can inform you about promotional events and provide you with information and marketing messages about products or services that may interest you. In addition, we may share your personal data with marketing platform providers, including social media advertising services, advertising networks, third-party data providers, to reach or better understand our users and measure the effectiveness of our ads on other platforms and with social media platforms, including Facebook and Google, for sign-in purposes. |
| ****Third-party service providers**** | Our third-party vendors and other service providers and contractors have access to your personal data to help carry out the services they are performing for us or on behalf of us. This may include vendors and providers who provide email or moreover electronic communication services, tax, legal and accounting services, product fulfilment, background checks and identity/verification processes, payment processing, customer support, fraud prevention and detection, data enhancement, web hosting and cloud storage, research, including surveys, analytics, crash reporting, performance monitoring and artificial intelligence, machine learning and statistical services. In addition, we will share data like your geolocation and the journey routes with Google in connection with the use of Google maps in our apps. |
| ****Insurers**** | We will share your data with insurers, where you, or a family member in your absence, request for a claim to be processed, for the purposes of facilitating the processing of insurance claims and for reporting purposes due to contractual requirements from the insurers. |
| ****Other third parties**** | In the event of a likely change of control of the business (or a part of the business) such as negotiations for a sale, an actual sell, a merger, and acquisition, or any transaction, or reorganisation, we may share your personal data with interested parties, including as part of any due diligence process with new or prospective business owners and their respective professional advisers. We may also need to transfer your personal data to that third party or re-organised entity after the sale or reorganisation for them to use for the same purposes as set out in this Notice. |
| ****Law Enforcement**** | We may disclose information under a court order or where we cooperate with a data protection supervisory authority in handling complaints or investigations. For example, we may also share your personal data with law enforcement or other public authorities, including responding to requests when the information is required by law or furthers a public interest task. In any scenario, we will take steps to ensure that we have a lawful basis on which to share the information, and we’ll make sure that we document our decision. |

Please note, that our websites and apps may contain links to other third-party websites. If you follow a link to any of those third-party websites, please be aware that those websites may have their own privacy notices and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for their notices or their processing of your personal data. Please check these notices before you submit any personal data to such third-party websites.

6\. Does Bolt transfer your personal data to other countries?

We operate internationally and as a result, your personal data may be transferred to, stored and/or processed by Bolt Group Companies, subcontractors and partners when undertaking the activities described in this Notice outside the country where you are located. Please see our Bolt Group Companies table for details of the countries where your personal data may be transferred to within the Bolt Group.

When we transfer your personal data outside of a country or region, such as the European Economic Area (“EEA”), we will make sure that we take steps necessary to comply with applicable legal requirements and rely on the following transfer mechanisms:

* ****Adequacy Decisions****: We will rely on decisions from the European Commission where they recognise that certain countries and territories outside of the European Economic Area ensure an adequate level of protection for personal information. Please click [here ↗](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en) to see the list of countries deemed ‘adequate’ by the European Commission and click [here ↗](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-approach-to-international-data-transfers/international-data-transfers-building-trust-delivering-growth-and-firing-up-innovation) to see the list of countries deemed ‘adequate’ by the UK Government. We rely on these adequacy decisions when we transfer personal data we collect from the EEA and the United Kingdom to the United States (where some of our third party service providers are based).
* ****Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)****: We will utilise standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission for transfers outside the EEA and by the UK Government for transfers outside of the United Kingdom. Please click [here ↗](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en) to see the EEA SCCs and click [here ↗](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/international-transfers/international-data-transfer-agreement-and-guidance/) to see the UK SCCs. We will rely on SCCs when we transfer personal data we collect from the EEA and the United Kingdom to the United States, Singapore and Nigeria where some of our third party service providers are based.

There may be certain situations (such as responding to law enforcement requests - see Section 4 “__What purposes do we use your personal data for and what is our legal basis for processing?__” above) where a transfer of personal data will take place on the basis of exemptions provided for under applicable data protection legislation. In these circumstances, we will take steps to minimise and protect the personal data transferred.

7\. How do we keep your personal data safe?

The security of your personal data is very important to us, and we have implemented appropriate technical and organisational controls to protect your personal data against unauthorised processing and against accidental loss, damage or destruction. We have implemented data encryption in transit and at rest, data privacy and security training, information security policies and controls around the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our data/systems.

Any personal data collected in the course of providing Bolt services is transferred to and stored in our data centres which are located within the EEA. Only authorised employees of ​Bolt Group companies and partners ​have access to the personal data and they may access the data only for the purpose of resolving issues associated with the use of the services (including disputes regarding transportation services and customer support services in the respective countries [https://bolt.eu/cities/](https://bolt.eu/cities/)).

For our research and scientific purposes, all data, like bulk Geolocation Data, is anonymised so you can never be identified from it. Regarding anonymised data, we will not attempt to re-identify your personal data that has been deidentified, in the course of sharing your data with other organisations.

You are responsible though for choosing a secure password when we ask you to set up a password to access parts of our sites or apps. You should keep this password confidential and you should choose a password that you do not use on any other site.

8\. How long do we retain your personal data for?

We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with our services and for the purposes described above in Section 4 “__What purposes do we use your personal data for and what is our legal basis for processing?__”.

This means that the retention periods will vary according to the type, the amount and sensitivity of your personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data and the reason that we have collected the personal data in the first place.

Here are the key criteria we use for determining our retention periods:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ****Retention Periods Criteria**** | ****Description**** |
| ****Personal data retained until you remove/delete it**** | It’s your right to request that we delete certain of your personal data. See Section 9 “What are your rights?” below for more information. |
| ****Personal data that expires after a specific period of time**** | We have set certain retention periods so that some data is not retained after a specific period of time. See table below for further details. After a retention period has lapsed, the personal data is securely deleted, unless it is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. |
| ****Personal data retained until your Bolt account is deleted**** | We keep your data until your Bolt account is deleted unless further retention of certain personal data are required for the purposes described in the second table below. |

We have listed below the specific retention periods that apply to the personal data we process about you:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ****Category of Retention Periods**** | ****Description**** |
| ****Tax, accounting and financial reporting purposes**** | We retain data for 10 years after the last journey if your personal data is necessary for tax, accounting and financial reporting purposes. |
| ****Provision of services purposes**** | We retain your data as long as you have an active passenger account. If your account is closed, personal data will be deleted (according to our retention schedule and rules), unless such data is still required to meet any legal obligation, or for accounting, dispute resolution or fraud prevention purposes. You may request deletion of your account at any time through the Bolt App. See Section 9 “What are your rights?” below for more information. |
| ****Formal investigations of a criminal offence, fraud or false information**** | We retain data for as long as necessary according to the internal, legal, and regulatory requirements, in the event that there are formal investigations of a criminal offence, fraud or false information having been provided. |
| ****Disputes**** | We retain data in the event of disputes, until the claim is satisfied or the expiry date of such claims. |
| ****Complaints**** | We retain a record of all complaints which we make available to an authorised officer of the licensing authority on request in the case of an investigation for 12 months. |
| ****Instant Messages**** | We retain data about instant messages between you and the Customer Support Team directly in the Bolt App for 90 days, except in cases where messages are related to a reported incident or in the event, they are related to a dispute, in which cases we will store them for 6 months. Instant messages between Passengers and Drivers are kept in the Bolt App only until the order is completed and for 3 months after in our systems. |
| ****Audio Trip Recording**** | We retain Audio Recording Data through our Audio Trip Recording Feature: 24 hours, while stored locally on the device of the person who generates the recording. The recordings are automatically deleted after 24 hours if a report to Bolt’s Customer Support team is not created and the recording is not explicitly shared with Bolt’s Customer Support team as part of the report. Recordings shared and investigated by Bolt will be automatically deleted after 7 days unless the retention period is manually extended for investigation/legal reasons. |
| ****Customer Support**** | We retain data in relation to support tickets, phone calls and chats for 3 years. |
| ****Rider Ratings**** | We retain Rider Rating Data for: 3 years for specific ratings and comments for the duration of Passenger or Driver account for the unmatching status |

Please note that the deinstallation of Bolt App in your device does not cause the deletion of your personal data. If the Bolt App has not been used for three years, we’ll get in touch and ask you to confirm whether you wish to keep your account active for future use. If no reply is received in a reasonable time, the account will be closed and personal data will be deleted unless such data is required for any purpose mentioned earlier in this Notice.

10\. How do we use your personal data for direct marketing?

Please be aware that you may from time to time receive updates about special offers and promotions related to our services. We send these communications based on our legitimate interests (soft opt-in) in providing you with information about opportunities that could be beneficial to you. In countries where soft opt-in is not an available lawful basis for Bolt’s processing activities, we will instead rely on an alternative valid legal basis. You have complete control over these communications, and if you decide at any time that you do not wish to receive them, you can stop them by clicking the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of our emails, typing “STOP” for messages and SMS, or updating your communication preferences in your account settings.

Additionally, we may seek your opt-in consent for specific direct marketing activities where this is required by law. For example, we might request your consent to send you information regarding third-party promotions and offers that we think might be of interest to you. You always have the ability to opt out by changing your communication preferences in your account settings. We also personalise direct marketing messages using information about how you use the Bolt services (for example, how often you use the Bolt App).

11\. How do we notify you of changes to this Notice?

We may make changes to this Notice from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify you (as required) via the Bolt App, website or via another method such as email.
