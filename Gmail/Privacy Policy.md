We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:

*   Google apps, sites and devices, such as Search, YouTube and Google Home
*   Platforms such as the Chrome browser and Android operating system
*   Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, such as ads and embedded Google Maps

You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content such as emails and photos, or to see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all; for example, searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web privately using Chrome in Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used.

To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos and definitions for [key terms](https://policies.google.com/privacy/key-terms?hl=en-GB#key-terms). And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can [contact us](https://support.google.com/policies?p=privpol_privts&hl=en_GB).

Information that Google collects
================================

We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services

We collect information to provide better services to all our users – from figuring out basic stuff such as which language you speak, to more complex things like which [ads you’ll find most useful](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-useful-ads), [the people who matter most to you online](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-people-online) or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.

When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information that we collect with [unique identifiers](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-unique-id) tied to the browser, application or [device](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-device) that you’re using. This helps us do things such as maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions.

When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as [personal information](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-personal-info).

Things that you create or provide to us
---------------------------------------

When you create a Google Account, you provide us with [personal information](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-personal-info) that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a [phone number](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-phone-number) or [payment information](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-payment-info) to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information – like an email address to receive updates about our services.

We also collect the content that you create, upload or receive from others when using our services. This includes things such as email you write and receive, photos and videos that you save, docs and spreadsheets you create and comments that you make on YouTube videos.

Information that we collect as you use our services
---------------------------------------------------

### Your apps, browsers & devices

We collect information about the apps, browsers and [devices](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-devices) that you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features such as automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.

The information that we collect includes [unique identifiers](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-unique-id), browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including operator name and phone number and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers and devices with our services, including [IP address](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-ip), crash reports, system activity, and the date, time and referrer URL of your request.

We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers – for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an [Android device with Google apps](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-android-device), your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things such as your device type, operator name, crash reports and which apps you’ve installed.

### Your activity

We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video that you might like. The activity information that we collect may include:

*   Terms that you search for
*   Videos that you watch
*   [Views and interactions with content and ads](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-content-views)
*   Voice and audio information when you use audio features
*   Purchase activity
*   People with whom you communicate or share content
*   Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
*   Chrome browsing history that you’ve [synced with your Google Account](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-chrome-sync)

If you use our [services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-calls-messages), we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information and types and volumes of calls and messages.

You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.

[Go to Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/?hl=en_GB)

### Your location information

We collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features such as driving directions for your weekend getaway or show times for movies playing near you.

Your location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by:

*   GPS
*   [IP address](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-ip)
*   [Sensor data from your device](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-sensor-data)
*   [Information about things near your device](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-near-device), such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers and Bluetooth-enabled devices

The types of location data that we collect depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can [turn your Android device’s location on or off](https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_location&hl=en_GB) using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on [Location History](https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_lochistory&hl=en_GB) if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices.

* * *

In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from [publicly accessible sources](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-sources). For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, including marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to [protect against abuse](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-against-abuse). We also receive information from [advertisers to provide advertising and research services on their behalf](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-ad-services).

We use various technologies to collect and store information, including [cookies](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-cookies), [pixel tags](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-pixel), local storage, such as [browser web storage](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-browser-storage) or [application data caches](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-application-data-cache), databases and [server logs](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-server-logs).

Why Google collects data
========================

We use data to build better services

We use the information that we collect from all our services for the following purposes:

### Provide our services

We use your information to [deliver our services](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-deliver-services), such as processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.

### Maintain & improve our services

We also use your information to [ensure that our services are working as intended](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-ensure-working), such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to [make improvements](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-make-improvements) to our services – for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.

### Develop new services

We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organised their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.

### Provide personalised services, including content and ads

We use the information we collect to customise our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalised content and [customised search results](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-customized-search). For example, [Security Check-Up](https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup?hl=en_GB) provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And Google Play uses information such as apps that you’ve already installed and videos that you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.

Depending on your settings, we may also show you [personalised ads](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-personalized-ads) based on your interests. For example, if you search for 'mountain bikes', you may see an ad for sports equipment when you’re browsing a site that shows ads served by Google. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings.

*   We don’t show you personalised ads based on [sensitive categories](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-sensitive-categories), such as race, religion, sexual orientation or health.
*   We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the 'tap to call' button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.

[Go to Ad Settings](https://adssettings.google.com/?hl=en_GB)

### Measure performance

We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyse data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimise product design. And we also use data about the ads with which you interact to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to [link information](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-link-info) about your activity from that site with activity from other sites that use our ad services.

### Communicate with you

We use information that we collect, such as your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, such as an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.

### Protect Google, our users and the public

We use information to help improve the [safety and reliability](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-safety-reliability) of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks and technical issues that could harm Google, our users or the public.

* * *

We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyse your content to provide you with things like customised search results, personalised ads or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyse your content to help us [detect abuse](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-detect-abuse) such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use [algorithms](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-algorithm) to recognise patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases that you ask it to translate.

We may [combine the information we collect](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-combine-info) among our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, [your activity on other sites and apps](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-other-sites) may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.

If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. For example, this helps people identify an email coming from you.

We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.

Your privacy controls
=====================

You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it’s used

This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services.

You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.

[Export your data](https://takeout.google.com/?hl=en_GB)

You can also [request to remove content](https://support.google.com/legal?p=privpol_remove&hl=en_GB) from specific Google services based on applicable law.

And finally, [Inactive Account Manager](https://myaccount.google.com/inactive?hl=en_GB) allows you to give someone else access to parts of your Google Account in case you’re unexpectedly unable to use your account.

* * *

There are other ways to control the information that Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:

*   Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a [cookie](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-cookies) in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services [rely on cookies to function properly](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-rely-on-cookies), for things such as remembering your language preferences.
*   Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can [modify location settings](https://support.google.com/websearch?p=privpol_locserp&hl=en_GB) on your Android device.

Sharing your information
========================

When you share your information
-------------------------------

Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.

When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in [ads, depending on your Shared Endorsements setting](https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_endorse&hl=en_GB).

When Google shares your information
-----------------------------------

We do not share your personal information with companies, organisations or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:

### With your consent

We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you [use Google Home to make a reservation](https://support.google.com/googlehome?p=privpol_homedata&hl=en_GB) through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any [sensitive personal information](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-sensitive-info).

### With domain administrators

If you’re a student, or work for an organisation that uses Google services, your [domain administrator](https://support.google.com/a?p=privpol_admin&hl=en_GB) and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:

*   Access and retain information stored in your account, such as your email
*   View statistics regarding your account, such as how many apps you install
*   Change your account password
*   Suspend or terminate your account access
*   Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request
*   Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings

### For external processing

We provide personal information to our [affiliates](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-affiliates) and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help us with customer support.

### For legal reasons

We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:

*   Meet any applicable law, regulation, [legal process or enforceable governmental request](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-legal). We share information about the number and type of requests that we receive from governments in our [Transparency Report](https://transparencyreport.google.com/user-data/overview?hl=en_GB).
*   Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
*   Detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
*   Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.

We may share [non-personally identifiable information](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-info) publicly and with our partners – such as publishers, advertisers, developers or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to [show trends](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-trends) about the general use of our services. We also allow [specific partners](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-specific-partners) to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.

If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

Keeping your information secure
===============================

We build security into our services to protect your information

All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.

We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorised access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we hold, including:

*   We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
*   We offer a range of security features, like [Safe Browsing](https://safebrowsing.google.com/?hl=en_GB), Security Check-Up and [2 Step Verification](https://www.google.com/landing/2step/?hl=en_GB) to help you protect your account
*   We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorised access to our systems
*   We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.

Exporting & deleting your information
=====================================

You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time

You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.

[Export your data](https://takeout.google.com/?hl=en_GB)

To delete your information, you can:

*   Delete your content from [specific Google services](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-delete-specific)
*   Search for and then delete specific items from your account using [My Activity](https://myactivity.google.com/?hl=en_GB)
*   [Delete specific Google products](https://myaccount.google.com/deleteservices?hl=en_GB), including your information associated with those products

[Delete your information](https://myaccount.google.com/delete-services-or-account?hl=en_GB)

Retaining your information
==========================

We retain the data that we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it and how you configure your settings:

*   Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as the content that you create or upload. You can also delete [activity information](https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity?hl=en_GB) saved in your account, or [choose to have it deleted automatically](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/465?authuser=0&hl=en_GB#auto-delete) after a set period of time.
*   Other data is deleted or anonymised automatically after a set period of time, such as [advertising data](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads?hl=en-GB) in server logs.
*   We keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services.
*   And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.

When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymised form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.

You can read more about Google’s [data retention periods](https://policies.google.com/technologies/retention?hl=en-GB), including how long it takes for us to delete your information.

Compliance & cooperation with regulators
========================================

We regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.

Data transfers
--------------

We maintain [servers around the world](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB#footnote-servers) and your information may be processed on servers located outside the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain [legal frameworks](https://policies.google.com/privacy/frameworks?hl=en-GB) relating to the transfer of data.

When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.
