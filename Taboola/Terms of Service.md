9\. General
-----------

The TOU and your use of the Sites shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of laws principles, unless otherwise stated by mandatory laws.

In no event shall any claim, action, or proceeding by you related in any way to the Sites be instituted more than one (1) year after the cause of action arose.  If any provision of the TOU (or part of such provision) is found to be invalid or unenforceable by any court having competent jurisdiction, then that provision (or part of that provision) shall be deemed severable from the TOU and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions — that invalid or unenforceable (part of the) clause will be replaced by a valid and/or enforceable, as the case may be, (part of the) clause which is as close to the intention of the parties as possible. The failure of Taboola to insist upon or enforce any of the provisions of these TOU, or to exercise any rights or remedies under these TOU, will not be construed as a waiver of Taboola’s right to assert or rely upon any such provisions, rights, or remedies in that or any other instance; rather, the same will be and remain in full force and effect.
