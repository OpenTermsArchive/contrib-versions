In order to provide our Services (as defined below) through our apps, services, features, software, or website, we need to obtain your express agreement to our Terms of Service ("Terms"). You agree to our Terms by registering, installing, accessing, or using our apps, services, features, software, or website.

### [](#)Our Services

If you live in a country in the European Economic Area (which includes the European Union), and any other included country or territory (collectively referred to as the ["European Region"](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/26000121/)), WhatsApp Ireland Limited provides the services described below to you; if you live in any other country except those in the [European Region](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/26000121/), it is WhatsApp Inc. (collectively, "WhatsApp," "our," "we," or "us") that provides the services described below to you (collectively, "Services"):

*   **Privacy And Security Principles.** Since we started WhatsApp, we've built our Services with strong privacy and security principles in mind.
    
*   **Connecting You With Other People.** We provide ways for you to communicate with other WhatsApp users including through messages, voice and video calls, sending images and video, showing your status, and sharing your location with others when you choose. We may provide a convenient platform that enables you to send and receive money to or from other users across our platform. WhatsApp works with partners, service providers, and affiliated companies to help us provide ways for you to connect with their services. We use the information we receive from them to help operate, provide, and improve our Services.
    
*   **Ways To Improve Our Services.** We analyze how you make use of WhatsApp, in order to improve all aspects of our Services described here, including helping businesses who use WhatsApp measure the effectiveness and distribution of their services and messages. WhatsApp uses the information it has and also works with partners, service providers, and affiliated companies to do this.
    
*   **Communicating With Businesses.** We provide ways for you and third parties, like businesses, to communicate with each other using WhatsApp, such as through order, transaction, and appointment information, delivery and shipping notifications, product and service updates, and marketing. Messages you may receive containing marketing could include an offer for something that might interest you. We do not want you to have a spammy experience; as with all of your messages, you can manage these communications, and we will honor the choices you make.
    
*   **Safety And Security.** We work to protect the safety and security of WhatsApp by appropriately dealing with abusive people and activity and violations of our Terms. We prohibit misuse of our Services, harmful conduct towards others, and violations of our Terms and policies, and address situations where we may be able to help support or protect our community. We develop automated systems to improve our ability to detect and remove abusive people and activity that may harm our community and the safety and security of our Services. If we learn of people or activity like this, we will take appropriate action by removing such people or activity or contacting law enforcement. We share information with other affiliated companies when we learn of misuse or harmful conduct by someone using our Services.
    
*   **Enabling Global Access To Our Services.** To operate our global Service, we need to store and distribute content and information in data centers and systems around the world, including outside your country of residence. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by our service providers or affiliated companies.
    
*   **Affiliated Companies.** We are part of the [Facebook Companies](https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678). As part of the Facebook Companies, WhatsApp receives information from, and shares information with, the Facebook Companies as described in WhatsApp's [Privacy Policy](/legal/?eea=1#privacy-policy). We use the information we receive from them to help operate, provide, and improve our Services.

### Special Arbitration Provision For United States Or Canada Users

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT CONTAINS ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE ONLY TO OUR UNITED STATES AND CANADA USERS. IF YOU ARE A WHATSAPP USER LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES OR CANADA, YOU AND WE AGREE TO SUBMIT ALL DISPUTES TO BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, EXCEPT FOR THOSE THAT INVOLVE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DISPUTES AND EXCEPT THOSE THAT CAN BE BROUGHT IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. THIS MEANS YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE SUCH DISPUTES RESOLVED IN COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY. THIS SECTION ALSO LIMITS THE TIME YOU HAVE TO BRING A CLAIM, INCLUDING THE TIME TO START AN ARBITRATION OR, IF PERMISSIBLE, A COURT ACTION. FINALLY, YOU MAY BRING A CLAIM ONLY ON YOUR OWN BEHALF, AND NOT ON BEHALF OF ANY OFFICIAL OR OTHER PERSON, OR CLASS OF PEOPLE. YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN, OR HAVE YOUR DISPUTE HEARD AND RESOLVED AS, A CLASS ACTION, A CLASS ARBITRATION, OR A REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.

"Excluded Dispute" means any Dispute relating to the enforcement or infringement of your or our intellectual property rights (such as copyrights, trademarks, domains, logos, trade dress, trade secrets, and patents). For clarity and notwithstanding the foregoing, those Disputes relating to, arising out of, or in any way in connection with your rights of privacy and publicity are not Excluded Disputes.

**Federal Arbitration Act.** The United States Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this "Special Arbitration Provision for United States or Canada Users" section, including any question whether a Dispute between WhatsApp and you is subject to arbitration.

**Agreement To Arbitrate For WhatsApp Users Located In The United States Or Canada.** For WhatsApp users who live in the United States or Canada, WhatsApp and you each agree to waive the right to a trial by judge or jury for all Disputes, except for the Excluded Disputes. WhatsApp and you agree that all Disputes (except for the Excluded Disputes), including those relating to, arising out of, or in any way in connection with your rights of privacy and publicity, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration. WhatsApp and you agree not to combine a Dispute that is subject to arbitration under our Terms with a Dispute that is not eligible for arbitration under our Terms.

The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is started, including the Optional Rules for Emergency Measures of Protection and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (together, the "AAA Rules"). The arbitration will be presided over by a single arbitrator selected in accordance with the AAA Rules. The AAA Rules, information regarding initiating a Dispute, and a description of the arbitration process are available at [](http://www.adr.org/)[www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/). The arbitrator will decide whether a Dispute can be arbitrated. The location of the arbitration and the allocation of fees and costs for such arbitration shall be determined in accordance with the AAA Rules.

**Opt-Out Procedure.** You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither we nor you can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify us in writing postmarked within 30 days of the later of: (i) the date that you first accepted our Terms; and (ii) the date you became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out:

WhatsApp Inc.  
Arbitration Opt-Out  
1601 Willow Road  
Menlo Park, California 94025  
United States of America

You must include: (i) your name and residence address; (ii) the mobile phone number associated with your account; and (iii) a clear statement that you want to opt out of our Terms' agreement to arbitrate.

**Small Claims Court.** As an alternative to arbitration, if permitted by your local "small claims" court's rules, you may bring your Dispute in your local "small claims" court, as long as the matter advances on an individual (non-class) basis.

**Time Limit To Bring Claim.** We and you agree that for any Dispute (except for the Excluded Disputes) we and you must bring claims (including commencing an arbitration proceeding) within one year after the Dispute first arose; otherwise, such Dispute is permanently barred. This means that if we or you do not bring a claim (including commencing an arbitration) within one year after the Dispute first arose, then the claim will be dismissed because it was started too late.

**No Class Actions, Class Arbitrations, Or Representative Actions For Users Located In The United States Or Canada.** We and you each agree that if you are a WhatsApp user located in the United States or Canada, each of we and you may bring Disputes against the other only on its or your own behalf, and not on behalf of any other person or entity, or any class of people. We and you each agree not to participate in a class action, a class-wide arbitration, Disputes brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated Disputes involving any other person or entity in connection with any Dispute.

**Severability.** If the prohibition against class actions and other Disputes brought on behalf of third parties is found to be unenforceable for a Dispute, then all of the provisions above under the caption "Special Arbitration Provision for United States or Canada Users" will be null and void as to that Dispute.

**Place To File Permitted Court Actions.** If you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, if your Dispute is an Excluded Dispute, or if the arbitration agreement is found to be unenforceable, you agree to be subject to the applicable provision in the "Dispute Resolution" section set forth above.
