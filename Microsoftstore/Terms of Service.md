Through the Microsoft Store, Microsoft provides you with access to a variety of resources, including the Website, information about software, services and other merchandise that may or may not be available for purchase, download areas, software and tools (collectively "Services"). The Services, including any updates, enhancements, new features, and/or the addition of any new Web properties, are subject to these Terms of Use and Sale ("Terms of Use and Sale" or "Contract"). By using the Website, purchasing products and services from the Microsoft Store or using any Services, you accept and agree to these Terms of Use and Sale, Microsoft's Privacy Statement (see the PRIVACY AND PROTECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION section below), and applicable terms and conditions, policies or disclaimers found in the Microsoft Store or referenced herein and accessible through the related hyperlinks (collectively the "Microsoft Store Policies"). We encourage you to read the Microsoft Store Policies carefully. YOU MAY NOT USE THE MICROSOFT STORE OR SERVICES IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE MICROSOFT STORE POLICIES.

    Any software made available to download or purchase from the Microsoft Store or Services is the copyrighted work of Microsoft and/or its suppliers.

Software licenses purchased at the Microsoft Store are subject to the license agreement that accompanies the software (the "License Agreement"). You will be required to agree to the terms and conditions of the License Agreement when you install the software.
    
    PLEASE CONTACT THE MICROSOFT STORE (AS DESCRIBED IN THE NOTICES AND COMMUNICATION SECTION BELOW) IF YOU WOULD LIKE A COPY OF THE APPLICABLE LICENSE AGREEMENT, AT NO COST, BEFORE YOU OPEN SOFTWARE.

Subject to the paragraph below, we usually store the download link and related digital key in your Microsoft account for 3 years following the purchase date, but do not promise to store them for any particular length of time. For ESD subscription products, different terms and storage rights may apply, which you will be able to review and agree to at the time of your subscription.
    
    You agree that we may cancel or modify our digital key storage program at any time. You also agree that we may stop supporting the storage of keys for one or more products at any time and for any reasons, including, by way of example, at the end of the product support life cycle, after which you will no longer have access to the download link or digital key. If we cancel or modify our program such that you will no longer have access to the download link or digital key(s) in your account, we will provide at least 90 days’ advance notice to you using the contact information for the related Microsoft account.
    
    OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    
    In addition to software and ESD products, other products and services available for purchase or trial on the Microsoft Store may also be offered to you subject to separate end user license agreements, terms of use, terms of service or other terms and conditions. If you purchase or use those products, you may be required to also accept those terms as a condition of purchase, installation or use.
    
8.  PRICE AND PAYMENT
    
    Prices at the Microsoft Store will be as stated on the Website. If we have a Microsoft Retail Store in your country or region, the prices, product selection and promotions offered there may be different from those on the Website. Microsoft does not guarantee that a price, product or promotion offered online will also be available or honored at a Microsoft Retail Store or vice versa.
    
    Pricing is for individual consumers. If you want to purchase for a commercial, educational or government organization, please ask for information about our volume licensing programs.
    
    The Microsoft Store does not have a price match guarantee. We will not match the advertised price other retailers offer for the same items.
    
    We may offer you the opportunity to pre-order a product from our Website before it is available for purchase.
    
      
    
    Terms Applicable to Pre-Orders of Non-Custom Products: We may place a hold on your credit or debit card at the time of pre-order but will not charge your card until the product is available for download or we ship it. If the advertised price of the product decreases between the date you pre-ordered and the date the product is available for download or shipping, we will charge you the lower price. You may cancel your pre-order before the product is shipped or available for download by calling our customer support number located on our Sales and Support page. Once your pre-order is shipped or available for download, our return policies apply. We will indicate on the Website if different pre-order terms apply to a specific product.
    
      
    
    Terms Applicable to Custom Products: Your payment method will be charged when your order is ready. Because we make custom products to your specifications, your order, once placed, cannot be cancelled or modified. Your products cannot be returned for a refund or credit unless they are defective, have a material or workmanship flaw, or as required under applicable law.
    
      
    
    Prices shown on the Website exclude all taxes or charges (“Taxes”) that may apply to your purchase. Prices shown on the Website also exclude delivery costs. Taxes and delivery costs will be added to the amount of your purchase and shown on the check-out page. You will have an opportunity to review the taxes and delivery costs before you confirm your purchase. Each item in your Shopping Cart is shown at the current price.
    
    The Microsoft Store offers different payment options as identified on our Website. We reserve the right to change our payment options at any time and for any reasons. If offers are made in your local currency and are payable in another currency with an international credit card, final price in your currency will depend on the foreign exchange rates, taxes and fees applied by your bank or the issuer of your international credit card issuer. These transactions may be subject to taxes and/or fees on international transactions not charged by Microsoft Store.
    
9.  AUTOMATIC RENEWAL PRODUCTS
    
    Provided that automatic renewals are allowed in your country, region, province, or state, you may purchase subscriptions from us that automatically renew.

(ii) authorize Microsoft to charge you for the services using your payment method. and (iii) authorize Microsoft to charge you for any paid feature of the services that you choose to sign up for or use while this agreement is in force. We will inform you by email before automatically renewing any subscription products. Once we have informed you that your subscription will be automatically renewed, we may automatically renew your services and charge you the then current price for the renewal term. We will also remind you that we will bill your chosen payment method for the services renewal, whether it was on file on the renewal date or provided later. We will also provide you with instructions on how you may cancel the services. You must cancel the services before the renewal date to avoid being billed for the renewal.

"Dispute" will be given the broadest possible meaning allowable under law.
        1.  **Notice of Dispute.** In the event of a dispute, you or Microsoft must give the other a Notice of Dispute, which is a written statement that sets forth the name, address and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the dispute, and the relief requested.

        4.  **Class Action Waiver. ANY PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE IN ANY FORUM WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. NEITHER YOU NOR MICROSOFT WILL SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. NO ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING WILL BE COMBINED WITH ANOTHER WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES TO ALL AFFECTED ARBITRATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS.**
        5.  **Arbitration Procedure, Costs and Fees.** Any arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and in many cases it is Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. For more information, see www.adr.org or call 1-800-778-7879. In a dispute involving $75,000 or less, Microsoft will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees. You and Microsoft agree to the terms governing procedures, fees, and incentives at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=279535. To commence arbitration, submit the form available at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=245497 to the AAA.

        6.  **Claims or Disputes Must Be Filed Within One Year.** To the extent permitted by law, any claim or dispute relating to the Microsoft Store, the Services, this Contract, or any product or service offered must be filed within one year in small claims court (Section 27.1.2), an arbitration proceeding (Section 27.1.3), or in court, if Section 27.1 permits the dispute to be filed in court instead of arbitration. The one-year period begins when the claim or Notice of Dispute first could be filed. If a claim or dispute is not filed within one year, it is permanently barred.
        7.  **Rejecting Future Arbitration Changes.** You may reject any change Microsoft makes to Section 27.1 (other than address changes) by sending us notice within 30 days of the change by U.S. Mail to the address in Section 27.1.1. If you do, the most recent version of Section 27.1 before the change you rejected will apply.
        8.  **Severability.** If the class action waiver in Section 27.1.4 is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then Section 27.1 will not apply to those parts. Instead, those parts will be severed and proceed in a court of law, with the remaining parts proceeding in arbitration. If any other provision of Section 27.1 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed with the remainder of Section 27.1 remaining in full force and effect.
    2.  Interpreting the Contract
        
        All parts of this Contract apply to the maximum extent permitted by the relevant law. you may have greater rights in your jurisdiction of residence. If it is determined that we can’t enforce a part of this Contract as written, we may replace those terms with similar terms to the extent enforceable under the relevant law, but the rest of this Contract won’t change. Section 27.1.8 says what happens if parts of Section 27.1 (arbitration and class action waiver) are found to be illegal or unenforceable, and prevails over this Section 27.2 if inconsistent with it. Other terms may apply if you purchase products or services from other Microsoft websites.
