Once logged into its Client Account, the Client selects the Service(s) it wishes to subscribe to and completes the Order by choosing a billing method and following the dedicated procedure available on the Platform.

Once the Order has been completed and validated by the Client, it shall be considered firm and final.

Article 5. FINANCIAL TERMS
--------------------------

**Price**. The price of the Services corresponds to a number of credits of space reserved for Resources, calculated according to the quantity and/or volume of Resources that the Client wishes to host on the Platform, as well as the duration of the Service subscribed.

The Services are invoiced on a per-consumer basis according to the rates and terms agreed between the Parties in the Order (the "**Budget Line**"). Prices are indicated in euros excluding tax. SCALINGO reserves the right to pass on, without delay, any tax or any increase in the rate of existing taxes. If required by applicable law, the Client will provide SCALINGO with its tax identification information.

**Consumption - Overruns - Not consumed credits**. The Client can manage its Budget Line directly from the dashboard available on its Client Account. The Client is thus continuously informed of its consumption. A consumption statement is made monthly and serves as the basis for billing the corresponding Service.

The Client is alerted to any overrun of the Budget Line. Depending on the payment method(s) chosen by the Client, the excess will be debited automatically or paid upon written notification of the invoice by SCALINGO. If necessary, the Client is invited to subscribe to a new Budget Line to benefit from additional space credits.

The Client expressly acknowledges that the Budget Line is fixed throughout the subscription period for the Service in question. If, at the end of the subscription period, the Client has not consumed all the credits, they will be deemed lost. The Client may not claim any compensation in this respect.

**Terms of payment**. Payment can be made by one or more of the following means:

(i) **Payment on the effective consumption by credit card debit**. The Services are invoiced on arrears. When placing an Order, the Client will enter the information relating to its payment card on the secure interface of the payment provider chosen by SCALINGO. It is specified that the bank data entered for the payment of the Services, do not transit on SCALINGO's servers. The amount consumed over the past month will be debited automatically at the beginning of the following month. (ii) **Payment on the effective consumption by SEPA debit**. This means of payment is open on the condition that the Client has a consumption of credits of a minimum of 100 € HT per month over three (3) consecutive months. The Client may make its request for SEPA debit by contacting SCALINGO at the address [sales@scalingo.com](mailto:sales@scalingo.com). The Client will then be invited to sign a SEPA mandate and by communicating to its bank the direct debit authorization that will be sent by SCALINGO. The amount consumed over the past month will be debited automatically at the beginning of the following month. (iii) **Prepayment by PayPal.** The Client may charge its Client Account with the amount of the Services with credits PayPal. The amount consumed over the past month will be debited automatically from the Client Account at the end of the month. In the absence of sufficient PayPal credits, the Client will be invited to recharge its Client Account with as many credits PayPal as necessary or, failing that, choose another means of payment (credit card or SEPA debit). Unless otherwise indicated when placing the Order, the Client is informed that the prepaid credits are valid for twelve (12) months from their purchase. If, at the end of the subscription period, the Client has not consumed all the credits, they will be deemed lost. The Client may not claim any compensation in this respect. (iv) **Payment by invoice, by bank transfer**. The Parties may agree on a payment on presentation of an invoice, issued on a monthly or quarterly basis, payable within sixty (60) days from the date of issue of the invoice. The Client can send its request to the contact address [sales@scalingo.com](mailto:sales@scalingo.com).

**Late payment.** In accordance with the provisions of Article L. 441-10 of the French Commercial Code, any delay in payment will incur, without notice and ipso jure, a lump sum recovery indemnity as determined by decree and penalties calculated on the basis of the statutory interest rate applied by the European Central Bank increased by 10 percentage points, without any reminder being necessary.

Notwithstanding the late payment interest calculated according to the above-mentioned conditions, SCALINGO reserves the right, after a payment reminder sent by email to the Client remained without effect more than ten (10) calendar days following the date of notification of the reminder, to suspend access to all or part of the Services, without this giving rise to the right to compensation or recourse for the benefit of the Client. The Client will only regain access to the Services upon payment of all sums due, in principal and interest.

In the event of outstanding payments, SCALINGO will have the right to terminate the Agreement, after notifying the Client by any means it deems appropriate, at the exclusive fault of the Client or to exercise any other legal remedy aimed at obtaining compensation for the damage it has suffered.

**Evolution of prices**. In the event of an increase in its price list, SCALINGO undertakes to inform the Client in advance so that the latter may, if necessary, unsubscribe or request the termination of the Services and/or the Agreement before undergoing the said price increase.

For Orders for Services without commitment of duration, SCALINGO will send, at the latest three (3) months before the date of application of the increase in the price of the Services, an email informing of said increase, its date of application and the possibility of unsubscribing.

For Service Orders with a duration commitment, the price of the Services may be increased only at the end of the commitment period. SCALINGO will inform the Client of the price increase no later than three (3) months before the end of the Order so that the latter may, if necessary, request the termination of the Order and/or the Agreement before undergoing said price increase.

Following this information and in case of continuation of the Services by the Client, the price of the Services will be increased to correspond to the new price in force and the amount of bank withdrawals will be adjusted in proportion to the changes in the price.

SCALINGO will take all necessary precautions to prevent the introduction by SCALINGO or its Subcontractors of any malicious program into the Client's information system and will take appropriate measures if it detects the existence of such malware.
