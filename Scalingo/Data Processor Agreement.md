The Customer as Data controller may request that Scalingo audit the Subprocessor or provide confirmation that such an audit has occurred (or, where available, obtain or assist Data Controller in obtaining a third-party audit report concerning Subprocessor’s operations) to ensure compliance with such obligations. The Controller also will be entitled, upon written request, to receive copies of the relevant terms of Scalingo’s agreement with Subprocessors that may process Personal Data, unless the agreement contains confidential information, in which case the Scalingo may provide a redacted version of the agreement.

The provisions relating to data protection aspects for subprocessing of the contract referred to in paragraph 1 shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the Customer is established.

10\. Technical and Organizational Measures
==========================================

When Processing Personal Data on behalf of Customer in connection with the Services, Scalingo shall ensure that it implements and maintains compliance with appropriate technical and organizational security measures for the Processing of such data. Accordingly, Scalingo will implement the following measures:

*   a) To prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to data processing systems in which Personal Data are Processed (physical access control), Scalingo shall take measures to prevent physical access, such as security personnel and secured buildings and factory premises.
    
*   b) To prevent data processing systems from being used without authorization (system access control), the following may, among other controls, be applied depending upon the particular Services ordered: authentication via passwords and logging of access on several levels.
    
    For Cloud Services hosted at the Scalingo: (i) logical access to the data centers is restricted and protected by firewall/VLAN; and (ii) the following security processes are applied: centralized logging and alerting, and (iii) firewalls.
    
*   c) To ensure that persons entitled to use a data processing system only have access to the Personal Data to which they have privilege of access, and that Personal Data cannot be read, copied, modified or removed without authorization in the course of Processing and/or after storage (data access control), Personal Data is accessible and manageable only by properly authorized staff, direct database query access is restricted, and application access rights are established and enforced.
    
    In addition to the access control rules set forth above, Scalingo implements an access policy under which Data Controller controls access to its Cloud Services environment and to Personal Data and other data by its authorized personnel.
    
*   d) To ensure that Personal Data cannot be read, copied, modified or removed without authorization during electronic transmission or transport, and that it is possible to check and establish to which entities the transfer of Personal Data by means of data transmission facilities is envisaged (transmission control), Scalingo will comply with the following requirements: Except as otherwise specified for the Cloud Services, transfers of data outside the Service environment are encrypted (HTTPS). The content of communications (including sender and recipient addresses) sent through some email or messaging services may not be encrypted once received through such services. Data Controller is solely responsible for the results of its decision to use non-encrypted communications or transmissions.
    
*   e) To ensure that it is possible to check and establish whether and by whom Personal Data have been entered into data processing systems, modified or removed (input control), Scalingo will comply with the following requirements: Personal Data source is under the control of the Customer, and Personal Data integration into the system is managed by secured file transfer (i.e., via web services or entered into the application) from the Customer.
    
*   f) To ensure that Personal Data is protected against accidental destruction or loss: backups are taken on a regular basis; backups are encrypted and are secured.
    
*   g) To ensure that Personal Data which is collected for different purposes may be Processed separately, data from different Data Controllers’ environments is logically segregated on Scalingo’s systems.
    

11\. Audit Rights
=================

The Customer may audit Scalingo’s compliance with the terms of the Agreement and this Data Processing Agreement up to once per year.

The Customer may perform more frequent audits of the Service computer systems that Process Personal Data to the extent required by laws applicable to the Customer. If a third party is to conduct the audit, the third party must be mutually agreed to by both parties and must execute a written confidentiality agreement acceptable to Scalingo before conducting the audit.

To request an audit, the Customer must submit a detailed audit plan at least 4 weeks in advance of the proposed audit date describing the proposed scope, duration, and start date of the audit.

Scalingo will seek the Data Controller’s written approval and agreement to pay any related fees before performing such audit assistance.

12\. Incident Management and Breach Notification
================================================

Scalingo evaluates and responds to incidents that create suspicion of unauthorized access to or handling of Personal Data.

The Customer is informed of such incidents and, depending on the nature of the activity, defines escalation paths and response teams to address those incidents. Scalingo will work with the Customer, with the appropriate technical teams and, where necessary, with outside law enforcement to respond to the incident. The goal of the incident response will be to restore the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Services environment, and to establish root causes and remediation steps.

Scalingo operations staff is instructed on responding to incidents where handling of personal data may have been unauthorized.

Scalingo shall notify the Customer without undue delay after becoming aware of a personal data breach. Scalingo shall promptly investigate any security breach and take reasonable measures to identify its root cause(s) and prevent a recurrence. As information is collected or otherwise becomes available, unless prohibited by law, Scalingo will provide Data Controller with a description of the security breach, the type of data that was the subject of the breach, and other information Data Controller may reasonably request concerning the affected persons. The parties agree to coordinate in good faith on developing the content of any related public statements or any required notices for the affected persons.

At Customer’s request, Scalingo will provide reasonable information in its possession that may be responsive to the demand and any assistance reasonably required for the Customer to respond to the demand in a timely manner.
