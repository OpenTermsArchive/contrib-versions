The Client is exclusively responsible for selecting the Services, ensuring that the Services are adapted to operate its activities and for processing of Personal Data. In this respect, it is the Client's responsibility to take all necessary security and insurance measures to protect the Personal Data it processes through the Platform, adapted to the risks incurred, due to the processing, on the fundamental rights and freedoms of the persons concerned.

### ARTICLE 18 - RESPONSIBILITY

It is reminded that SCALINGO is subject to an obligation of means in the provision of the Platform and Services to the Client. SCALINGO's responsibility towards the Client may only be sought, in accordance with article 15 of the GTC, in the case of direct damage suffered by the Client and caused by a proven contractual violation by SCALINGO committed in or during the performance of its obligations.

In any event, SCALINGO's responsibility will be capped, for all causes combined, at the amount of payments made by the latter over the last twelve (12) months of the Agreement.

Without prejudice to the foregoing, the Client expressly acknowledges and accepts that SCALINGO shall not be liable under any circumstances for the processing of Personal Data carried out by the Client through the Platform. The Client, as the Data Controller, is exclusively responsible towards third parties for compliance with the Data Protection Regulations and guarantees SCALINGO against any action, claim or recourse from third parties (data subjects, supervisory authorities or other third parties) in this regard.

According to Article 82 of the GDPR, the responsibility of SCALINGO, as a subcontractor, is strictly limited to the contractual obligations undertaken within the framework of the DPA, SCALINGO excluding any extended responsibility in this respect.
