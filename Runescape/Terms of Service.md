This website is owned and operated by Jagex Limited ("**Jagex**"), a company registered in England and Wales (registered number 3982706). Our registered office is at St John's Innovation Centre, Cowley Road, Cambridge, CB4 0WS, United Kingdom. Our VAT number is 791 951 784.

2\. Definitions

"**Jagex Product(s)**" is used as shorthand for our online games including all Jagex websites used to play those games and products published by Jagex on behalf of third parties. The ongoing supply of any particular Jagex Product is not guaranteed. Some Jagex Products have age restrictions.

References to "**Stopping**" or to "**Stop**" an account includes temporarily or permanently banning or muting an account. If your account is muted, you can continue to play but will not be able to use free text chat. If your account is banned, you will not be able to access your account and any licenses previously granted to you to use Jagex Products will be revoked. This means you will lose your account, characters and any in-game items or currency. Subscription credit continues to expire if accounts are Stopped.

More information about when Jagex may Stop your account can be found in section 12 of these terms and conditions.

"**Subscriber**" is used to describe a user of a Jagex Product who pays a fee to obtain enhanced features of that Jagex Product. More information about subscriptions can be found in section 13 of these terms and conditions.

"**User Content**" means all information of any kind (including text, images, video, information and messages) uploaded or sent by users on or in connection with Jagex Products. Jagex Products may include social elements which permit players to come into contact with and chat to other players. Messages exchanged between players, whether in private in-game messaging or public forums, are included within this definition of User Content.

"**Virtual Currencies**" is used to describe the in-game currencies that can be purchased in certain Jagex Products. More information about Virtual Currencies can be found in section 14 of these terms and conditions.

3\. Applicability of the terms and conditions

Please read these terms and conditions carefully. It is a condition of your use of a Jagex Product (whether or not you are a Subscriber) that you accept these terms and conditions in full. If you don't agree with any part, please do not use the Jagex Product.

If you have any questions about these terms and conditions, please contact us via email at and do not use the Jagex Product until you are satisfied with and can accept these terms and conditions in full.

4\. Changes to the terms and conditions

We may change these terms and conditions to reflect: (a) changes in applicable laws. (b) regulatory or security requirements. (c) relevant guidance or codes of practice. (d) technical alterations to Jagex Products. and (e) to improve clarity and consistency.

Please check the terms and conditions whenever you use a Jagex Product. If you are not a Subscriber, we will treat your continued use of a Jagex Product as acceptance of these changes from their effective date (as shown above). If you are a Subscriber, we will treat the first renewal date of your subscription after the changes as your acceptance of the changes. If you do not agree with the changes you should cancel your subscription (as explained below in section 13 of these terms and conditions) before the renewal date.

5\. Preteens and users under 18

Some Jagex Products may have age restrictions which prevent users under 13 creating an account. If a Jagex Product is not subject to age restrictions, a user under 13 may create an account. However, they must get consent from their parents/guardians to use the Jagex Product in accordance with our terms and conditions and privacy policy. We may Stop any account if we are not satisfied that such consent has been given or that such consent does not comply with local laws regarding users who are under 13 years of age.

We do not knowingly collect or store any personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we find out that any personally identifiable information we have collected is from someone under 13, we will automatically delete it, and we may Stop the account.

We recommend that parents/guardians should play together with their children who are under the age of 13.

If you are under 18, by using our website you are representing (i.e. making a promise) that you have consent from your parents/guardian to use Jagex Products in accordance with our terms and conditions and privacy policy. We may Stop any account if we are not satisfied that such consent has been given.

If we are told by a parent/guardian that their child has lied about their age when registering for Jagex Products, we will Stop the account provided we have information which satisfies us that the reporting person is indeed the parent or guardian of that child.

Parents can find more information about Jagex Products and how to contact us in the Parents' Guide.

6\. Safety and abuse

Before using any Jagex Product you should read the Online Safety Information. Parents of those under 18 should also review this information.

We are under no obligation to (and do not) monitor User Content. You should be aware of the potential risks of using a service which includes extensive User Content. User Content may be inaccurate, out of date or otherwise inappropriate. We cannot guarantee that users will comply with our terms and conditions, rules or otherwise behave appropriately. You should not assume that a person is who he or she claims to be. In your own interests, you should not attempt to contact any user outside a Jagex Product.

If you are the victim of offensive or inappropriate behaviour or receive any other unwanted communications, you should report such inappropriate behaviour to us via the in game "Report abuse" button as well as seeking appropriate external help, for example from parents or law enforcement authorities. If you continue to suffer problems, or are not satisfied, then you must stop using the relevant Jagex Product(s).

7\. Your account and license

To use many features of Jagex Products, we require you to create an account and, in relation to some Jagex Products, download client software. We grant valid account holders a non-exclusive, non-transferable, personal, limited license, which can be revoked at any time, to use Jagex Products, to download and use our client software and to connect to our servers solely to use Jagex Products for non-commercial purposes in accordance with these terms and conditions. The Jagex Products and any associated software are licensed, not sold. Your license confers no title or ownership to the Jagex Products or software.

When setting up an account for a Jagex Product, you may be asked to choose a username. You must not choose a username that infringes the rights of any third party, impersonates Jagex staff or other users, which is deliberately confusing, offensive, racist, obscene, hurtful, unlawful or otherwise inappropriate or which breaches the username requirements specified on the website or in the rules of the Jagex Product. We reserve the right to make such assessment in our sole discretion, change any username for any reason or take such other action as we believe appropriate.

You agree to keep your password safe at all times and not to disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for the activities of all persons who use your password to gain access to your account. To help ensure the safety of your password, you must keep your computer free of viruses and other malicious code including Trojans, worms, time bombs, malware and spyware. You must use your password in accordance with the password requirements specified on the website or in the rules of the Jagex Product. Real Jagex staff will never ask you for your password.

If you believe that someone has stolen your password or otherwise gained access to your account, you should submit an account recovery request via the website of the Jagex Product.

In such event, Jagex shall not be required to provide refunds, benefits or other compensation to users in connection with such discontinued elements of the Jagex Product.

9\. Rules

12\. Jagex Stopping your account

If, acting reasonably, we consider that:

1.  our terms and conditions or any Jagex Product rules - have or may have been breached;
2.  there has been fraudulent, unlawful or abusive activity. or
3.  it is necessary in order to prevent or stop any harm or damage to us, to any Jagex Product, to other players or the general public

we may at any time: (i) Stop (as defined above) any or all accounts for Jagex Products. (ii) restrict access to any content-uploading or other feature of our service. and/or (iii) restrict access to or delete virtual currency or anything acquired by means of virtual currency. These actions may result in loss of real money paid in prohibited transactions, such as account trading. If we take any of the above action, you may have a right of appeal.

We do not guarantee the ongoing supply of any Jagex Product. Upon reasonable notice to you, Jagex may deactivate any account and you acknowledge and agree that you are not entitled to any refund for any amounts paid in connection with the account.

13\. Subscriptions and cancellations

You need a subscription to use certain features of Jagex Products. If you apply for a subscription, you must ensure all the information that you submit is true and accurate (including, without limitation, your credit/debit card number and expiration date, and other payment details) and that you have appropriate parental or guardian consent if you are under 18 years of age. You agree to pay all subscription fees specified when you apply including all applicable taxes. Unless otherwise stated, all prices shown for EU countries include VAT.

By submitting your order you are making an offer to subscribe to the relevant part of the Jagex Product(s). Your offer is accepted and a binding contract occurs when: (i) we send a message to your account mail inbox confirming that your payment has been received, or (ii) you log into a subscribers-only part of a Jagex Product (whichever comes first).

All subscription payments will continue to be taken in advance at the relevant intervals (e.g. monthly in the case of monthly subscriptions) until you cancel your subscription (see below).

Payments by credit/debit cards are also subject to our credit card agreement which forms part of these terms and conditions.

We reserve the right to alter the amount or terms of our subscription fees at any time. This will only apply to those who, following the change, take out new subscriptions or re-subscribe (their previous subscriptions having expired) and specifically agree to the new fees/terms.

We reserve the right to charge you for any unauthorized use of your subscription by third parties.

13\. Cancelling your subscription

You may cancel your subscription at any time by clicking here or visiting the account management section on the website of the Jagex Product.

Upon cancellation you will not be charged any further subscription fees. No payments already made in respect of subscriptions or virtual currencies or items will be refunded (wholly or partly) but you can of course use up any unused subscription credit in the account.

14\. Virtual Currencies, micro-game credits and virtual items

In certain Jagex Products, we offer for sale (or in our sole discretion, as free promotions): (i) Virtual Currencies, and (ii) credits that can be redeemed to play micro-games ("**Micro-Game Credits**"). Virtual Currencies and Micro-Game Credits can be redeemed (i.e. used) to acquire certain digital goods/services, which we describe below as "**Items**". If you obtain Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits from Jagex, you must check that they have been correctly credited to your account and tell us immediately if not.

PLEASE TAKE NOTE that Virtual Currencies and Micro-Game Credits are subject to very important restrictions:

Virtual Currency and Micro-Game Credits may expire if they have not been redeemed within a certain period after acquisition, so you should redeem these as soon as possible. The expiry period is whatever we specify when you acquire the Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits or, if we haven't specified a time limit, twelve months from acquisition.

Unless we say otherwise on our website, Virtual Currency and Micro-Game Credits can only be redeemed within the world of the game where you acquired them. Each Jagex Product may contain one or more Virtual Currencies or Micro-Game Credits and unless otherwise stated, each Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credit is independent and is not exchangeable for any other Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credit in the same Jagex Product. We may at any time in our sole discretion change or remove any Item which can be acquired using Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits, as well as change the amount of Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits needed to acquire a particular Item. You may only redeem Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits for Items on offer at the time of redemption.

Virtual Currency and Micro-Game Credits do not have any inherent value and are not your own private property. When you purchase or receive Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits, you do not own the Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits. Instead they constitute a measurement of the extent of your license in a Jagex Product. Similarly, any Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits balance shown in your account does not constitute a real world balance or reflect any stored monetary value.

We do not provide any cash or refunds for Virtual Currency, Micro-Game Credits or Items (except as required by law) and Virtual Currency, Micro-Game Credits and Items do not have any real world monetary value. Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits are for your personal use only. You must not sell or transfer them or make them available to anyone else or attempt to do so, or encourage anyone else to do any of these things. Virtual Currency, Micro-Game Credits and Items can never be redeemed for real world money, goods or any other item of monetary value, and cannot be inherited. We may impose additional restrictions concerning the acquisition or redemption of Virtual Currency, Micro-Game Credits and Items. For example, we may cap the amount of Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits which can be acquired, held or redeemed in any particular period or we may impose restrictions based on your country of residence. Certain Items may also only be available to Subscribers.

For the avoidance of doubt, Virtual Currency and Micro-Game Credits have no cash value, do not accrue interest and, unless otherwise required by law, are not redeemable or refundable for any sum of money or monetary value from Jagex at any time.

Jagex reserves the right to restrict access to, delete, reduce or liquidate Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits: (1) if you have misused the Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits or breached any of these terms and conditions. (2) if the Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits were awarded in error. (3) if a payment for Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits is charged back or otherwise cancelled or reversed. or (4) if you have used Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits to conduct any fraudulent or illegal activity.

Jagex reserves the right to restrict access to or delete Items: (1) if you have misused the Items or breached any of these terms and conditions. (2) if the Items were purchased using Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits awarded in error. or (3) if a payment for Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits used to purchase the Items is charged back or otherwise cancelled or reversed. In addition, Items that have been acquired by the redemption of Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits may expire after a period of time, which by default shall be twelve months from acquisition. In addition, Items may have particular restrictions, or be consumed or extinguished in the course of your use of a Jagex Product.

We may at any time decide to end in part or its entirety the Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits program for all or any of our Jagex Products. Before we delete the unused Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits, we will endeavour to contact you to give at least four weeks to redeem them.

RuneScape Bonds

Within the Jagex Product RuneScape, users can purchase a RuneScape Bond from Jagex. If you obtain a RuneScape Bond from Jagex, you must check that it has been correctly credited to your account and tell us immediately if not.

RuneScape Bonds can be redeemed (i.e. used) to acquire RuneScape subscription, Virtual Currency, Micro-Game Credits and/or special promotional items that Jagex may decide to offer from time to time in its sole discretion - we describe these collectively as "**Redemption Items**", Alternatively, RuneScape Bonds can be traded in-game with other users in return for in-game items. More information about RuneScape Bonds can be found here.

PLEASE TAKE NOTE that RuneScape Bonds are subject to very important restrictions:

RuneScape Bonds can only be traded and redeemed within RuneScape.

We may at any time change or remove any Redemption Items which can be purchased using a RuneScape Bond, as well as change the amount of the RuneScape Bond needed to acquire a particular Redemption Item. You may only redeem the RuneScape Bond for Redemption Items on offer at the time of redemption.

RuneScape Bonds: (i) do not constitute a real world balance or reflect stored monetary value. (ii) cannot be redeemed for real world money and cannot be inherited. and (iii) are not your own private property. A RuneScape Bond is a measurement of the extent of your license in a Jagex Product.

We do not provide any cash or refunds for RuneScape Bonds (except as required by law). We may impose additional restrictions concerning the acquisition or redemption of RuneScape Bonds. For example we may cap the amount of RuneScape Bonds which can be acquired, held or redeemed in any particular period or we may impose restrictions based on your country of residence.

Jagex reserves the right to restrict access to, delete, reduce or liquidate RuneScape Bonds: (1) if you have misused the RuneScape Bond or breached any of these terms and conditions. (2) if the RuneScape Bond was awarded in error. (3) if a payment for a RuneScape Bond is charged back or otherwise cancelled or reversed. or (4) if you have used RuneScape Bonds to conduct any fraudulent or illegal activity.

Jagex reserves the right to restrict access to or delete Redemption Items: (1) if you have misused the Redemption Items or breached any of these terms and conditions. (2) if the Redemption Items were purchased using RuneScape Bonds awarded in error. or (3) if a payment for RuneScape Bonds used to purchase Redemption Items is charged back or otherwise cancelled or reversed. In addition, Redemption Items that have been acquired by the redemption of RuneScape Bonds may expire after a period of time, which by default shall be twelve months from acquisition.

Redemption Items may have particular restrictions, or be consumed or extinguished in the course of your use of Jagex Products.

We may at any time decide to end part of or the entirety of the RuneScape Bond program. Before we delete the unused RuneScape Bond, we will endeavour to contact you to give you at least four weeks to redeem it.

If your account for a Jagex Product remains dormant (i.e. is not used) for more than 12 months, and there is unredeemed Virtual Currency, Micro-Game Credits or RuneScape Bonds associated with your account, we may choose to credit your account with Items of equivalent value for this expired Virtual Currency, Micro-Game Credits or RuneScape Bonds.  We will endeavour to contact you by email prior to such action being taken.

15\. Refund policy

We are happy to review requests for refunds on a case by case basis. However, refunds are not always possible to give for many reasons.

Unless required by law, we will not refund any amounts paid in relation to subscriptions, Micro-Game Credits, RuneScape Bonds or Virtual Currency when:

*   You have been the victim of in-game scamming, as there are many warnings about avoiding this on the Jagex Products (however, we will do everything we reasonably can to assist you to recover your account).
*   You have been banned from a Jagex Product for violating these terms and conditions, any rules of a Jagex Product or the user content policy.
*   Jagex stops offering the Jagex Product or you decide to cancel your subscription or account.

If, after reading the above, you wish to request that we consider a refund, then please contact Billing Support for assistance, providing as much information as possible. Please note, refunds are given at the sole discretion of Jagex.

Please also review our "Cancellation Policy" which can be found by clicking here, which is incorporated into these terms and conditions.

"**Jagex Product(s)**" is used as shorthand for our online games including all Jagex websites used to play those games and products published by Jagex on behalf of third parties. The ongoing supply of any particular Jagex Product is not guaranteed. Some Jagex Products have age restrictions.

References to "**Stopping**" or to "**Stop**" an account includes temporarily or permanently banning or muting an account. If your account is muted, you can continue to play but will not be able to use free text chat. If your account is banned, you will not be able to access your account and any licenses previously granted to you to use Jagex Products will be revoked. This means you will lose your account, characters and any in-game items or currency. Subscription credit continues to expire if accounts are Stopped.

5\. Preteens and users under 18

Some Jagex Products may have age restrictions which prevent users under 13 creating an account. If a Jagex Product is not subject to age restrictions, a user under 13 may create an account. However, they must get consent from their parents/guardians to use the Jagex Product in accordance with our terms and conditions and privacy policy. We may Stop any account if we are not satisfied that such consent has been given or that such consent does not comply with local laws regarding users who are under 13 years of age.

We do not knowingly collect or store any personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we find out that any personally identifiable information we have collected is from someone under 13, we will automatically delete it, and we may Stop the account.

We recommend that parents/guardians should play together with their children who are under the age of 13.

If you are under 18, by using our website you are representing (i.e. making a promise) that you have consent from your parents/guardian to use Jagex Products in accordance with our terms and conditions and privacy policy. We may Stop any account if we are not satisfied that such consent has been given.

If we are told by a parent/guardian that their child has lied about their age when registering for Jagex Products, we will Stop the account provided we have information which satisfies us that the reporting person is indeed the parent or guardian of that child.

Parents can find more information about Jagex Products and how to contact us in the Parents' Guide.

12\. Jagex Stopping your account

If, acting reasonably, we consider that:

1.  our terms and conditions or any Jagex Product rules - have or may have been breached;
2.  there has been fraudulent, unlawful or abusive activity. or
3.  it is necessary in order to prevent or stop any harm or damage to us, to any Jagex Product, to other players or the general public

we may at any time: (i) Stop (as defined above) any or all accounts for Jagex Products. (ii) restrict access to any content-uploading or other feature of our service. and/or (iii) restrict access to or delete virtual currency or anything acquired by means of virtual currency. These actions may result in loss of real money paid in prohibited transactions, such as account trading. If we take any of the above action, you may have a right of appeal.

We do not guarantee the ongoing supply of any Jagex Product. Upon reasonable notice to you, Jagex may deactivate any account and you acknowledge and agree that you are not entitled to any refund for any amounts paid in connection with the account.

13\. Subscriptions and cancellations

You need a subscription to use certain features of Jagex Products. If you apply for a subscription, you must ensure all the information that you submit is true and accurate (including, without limitation, your credit/debit card number and expiration date, and other payment details) and that you have appropriate parental or guardian consent if you are under 18 years of age. You agree to pay all subscription fees specified when you apply including all applicable taxes. Unless otherwise stated, all prices shown for EU countries include VAT.

By submitting your order you are making an offer to subscribe to the relevant part of the Jagex Product(s). Your offer is accepted and a binding contract occurs when: (i) we send a message to your account mail inbox confirming that your payment has been received, or (ii) you log into a subscribers-only part of a Jagex Product (whichever comes first).

All subscription payments will continue to be taken in advance at the relevant intervals (e.g. monthly in the case of monthly subscriptions) until you cancel your subscription (see below).

Payments by credit/debit cards are also subject to our credit card agreement which forms part of these terms and conditions.

We reserve the right to alter the amount or terms of our subscription fees at any time. This will only apply to those who, following the change, take out new subscriptions or re-subscribe (their previous subscriptions having expired) and specifically agree to the new fees/terms.

We reserve the right to charge you for any unauthorized use of your subscription by third parties.

13\. Cancelling your subscription

You may cancel your subscription at any time by clicking here or visiting the account management section on the website of the Jagex Product.

Upon cancellation you will not be charged any further subscription fees. No payments already made in respect of subscriptions or virtual currencies or items will be refunded (wholly or partly) but you can of course use up any unused subscription credit in the account.

14\. Virtual Currencies, micro-game credits and virtual items

In certain Jagex Products, we offer for sale (or in our sole discretion, as free promotions): (i) Virtual Currencies, and (ii) credits that can be redeemed to play micro-games ("**Micro-Game Credits**"). Virtual Currencies and Micro-Game Credits can be redeemed (i.e. used) to acquire certain digital goods/services, which we describe below as "**Items**". If you obtain Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits from Jagex, you must check that they have been correctly credited to your account and tell us immediately if not.

PLEASE TAKE NOTE that Virtual Currencies and Micro-Game Credits are subject to very important restrictions:

Virtual Currency and Micro-Game Credits may expire if they have not been redeemed within a certain period after acquisition, so you should redeem these as soon as possible. The expiry period is whatever we specify when you acquire the Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits or, if we haven't specified a time limit, twelve months from acquisition.

Unless we say otherwise on our website, Virtual Currency and Micro-Game Credits can only be redeemed within the world of the game where you acquired them. Each Jagex Product may contain one or more Virtual Currencies or Micro-Game Credits and unless otherwise stated, each Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credit is independent and is not exchangeable for any other Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credit in the same Jagex Product. We may at any time in our sole discretion change or remove any Item which can be acquired using Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits, as well as change the amount of Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits needed to acquire a particular Item. You may only redeem Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits for Items on offer at the time of redemption.

Virtual Currency and Micro-Game Credits do not have any inherent value and are not your own private property. When you purchase or receive Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits, you do not own the Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits. Instead they constitute a measurement of the extent of your license in a Jagex Product. Similarly, any Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits balance shown in your account does not constitute a real world balance or reflect any stored monetary value.

We do not provide any cash or refunds for Virtual Currency, Micro-Game Credits or Items (except as required by law) and Virtual Currency, Micro-Game Credits and Items do not have any real world monetary value. Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits are for your personal use only. You must not sell or transfer them or make them available to anyone else or attempt to do so, or encourage anyone else to do any of these things. Virtual Currency, Micro-Game Credits and Items can never be redeemed for real world money, goods or any other item of monetary value, and cannot be inherited. We may impose additional restrictions concerning the acquisition or redemption of Virtual Currency, Micro-Game Credits and Items. For example, we may cap the amount of Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits which can be acquired, held or redeemed in any particular period or we may impose restrictions based on your country of residence. Certain Items may also only be available to Subscribers.

For the avoidance of doubt, Virtual Currency and Micro-Game Credits have no cash value, do not accrue interest and, unless otherwise required by law, are not redeemable or refundable for any sum of money or monetary value from Jagex at any time.

Jagex reserves the right to restrict access to, delete, reduce or liquidate Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits: (1) if you have misused the Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits or breached any of these terms and conditions. (2) if the Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits were awarded in error. (3) if a payment for Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits is charged back or otherwise cancelled or reversed. or (4) if you have used Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits to conduct any fraudulent or illegal activity.

Jagex reserves the right to restrict access to or delete Items: (1) if you have misused the Items or breached any of these terms and conditions. (2) if the Items were purchased using Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits awarded in error. or (3) if a payment for Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits used to purchase the Items is charged back or otherwise cancelled or reversed. In addition, Items that have been acquired by the redemption of Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits may expire after a period of time, which by default shall be twelve months from acquisition. In addition, Items may have particular restrictions, or be consumed or extinguished in the course of your use of a Jagex Product.

We may at any time decide to end in part or its entirety the Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits program for all or any of our Jagex Products. Before we delete the unused Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits, we will endeavour to contact you to give at least four weeks to redeem them.

RuneScape Bonds

Within the Jagex Product RuneScape, users can purchase a RuneScape Bond from Jagex. If you obtain a RuneScape Bond from Jagex, you must check that it has been correctly credited to your account and tell us immediately if not.

RuneScape Bonds can be redeemed (i.e. used) to acquire RuneScape subscription, Virtual Currency, Micro-Game Credits and/or special promotional items that Jagex may decide to offer from time to time in its sole discretion - we describe these collectively as "**Redemption Items**", Alternatively, RuneScape Bonds can be traded in-game with other users in return for in-game items. More information about RuneScape Bonds can be found here.

PLEASE TAKE NOTE that RuneScape Bonds are subject to very important restrictions:

RuneScape Bonds can only be traded and redeemed within RuneScape.

We may at any time change or remove any Redemption Items which can be purchased using a RuneScape Bond, as well as change the amount of the RuneScape Bond needed to acquire a particular Redemption Item. You may only redeem the RuneScape Bond for Redemption Items on offer at the time of redemption.

RuneScape Bonds: (i) do not constitute a real world balance or reflect stored monetary value. (ii) cannot be redeemed for real world money and cannot be inherited. and (iii) are not your own private property. A RuneScape Bond is a measurement of the extent of your license in a Jagex Product.

We do not provide any cash or refunds for RuneScape Bonds (except as required by law). We may impose additional restrictions concerning the acquisition or redemption of RuneScape Bonds. For example we may cap the amount of RuneScape Bonds which can be acquired, held or redeemed in any particular period or we may impose restrictions based on your country of residence.

Jagex reserves the right to restrict access to, delete, reduce or liquidate RuneScape Bonds: (1) if you have misused the RuneScape Bond or breached any of these terms and conditions. (2) if the RuneScape Bond was awarded in error. (3) if a payment for a RuneScape Bond is charged back or otherwise cancelled or reversed. or (4) if you have used RuneScape Bonds to conduct any fraudulent or illegal activity.

Jagex reserves the right to restrict access to or delete Redemption Items: (1) if you have misused the Redemption Items or breached any of these terms and conditions. (2) if the Redemption Items were purchased using RuneScape Bonds awarded in error. or (3) if a payment for RuneScape Bonds used to purchase Redemption Items is charged back or otherwise cancelled or reversed. In addition, Redemption Items that have been acquired by the redemption of RuneScape Bonds may expire after a period of time, which by default shall be twelve months from acquisition.

Redemption Items may have particular restrictions, or be consumed or extinguished in the course of your use of Jagex Products.

We may at any time decide to end part of or the entirety of the RuneScape Bond program. Before we delete the unused RuneScape Bond, we will endeavour to contact you to give you at least four weeks to redeem it.

If your account for a Jagex Product remains dormant (i.e. is not used) for more than 12 months, and there is unredeemed Virtual Currency, Micro-Game Credits or RuneScape Bonds associated with your account, we may choose to credit your account with Items of equivalent value for this expired Virtual Currency, Micro-Game Credits or RuneScape Bonds.  We will endeavour to contact you by email prior to such action being taken.

15\. Refund policy

We are happy to review requests for refunds on a case by case basis. However, refunds are not always possible to give for many reasons.

Unless required by law, we will not refund any amounts paid in relation to subscriptions, Micro-Game Credits, RuneScape Bonds or Virtual Currency when:

*   You have been the victim of in-game scamming, as there are many warnings about avoiding this on the Jagex Products (however, we will do everything we reasonably can to assist you to recover your account).
*   You have been banned from a Jagex Product for violating these terms and conditions, any rules of a Jagex Product or the user content policy.
*   Jagex stops offering the Jagex Product or you decide to cancel your subscription or account.
