References to "Stopping" or to "Stop" an account includes temporarily or permanently banning or muting an account. If your account is muted, you can continue to play but will not be able to use free text chat. If your account is banned, you will not be able to access your account and any licenses previously granted to you to use Jagex Products will be revoked. This means you will lose your account, characters and any in-game items or currency. Membership credit continues to expire if accounts are muted or banned.

"User Content" means all information of any kind (including text, images, video, information and messages) uploaded or sent by users on or in connection with Jagex Products.

3\. Applicability of the terms and conditions

Please read these terms and conditions carefully. Your accepting them in full is a condition of your use of a Jagex Product (whether or not you subscribe). If you don't agree with any part, please do not use the Jagex Product.

If you have any questions about these terms and conditions, please contact us via email at and do not use the site until you are satisfied with and can accept these terms and conditions in full.

4\. Changes to the terms and conditions

We may change these terms and conditions to reflect: (a) changes in applicable laws. (b) regulatory or security requirements. (c) relevant guidance or codes of practice. (d) technical alterations to Jagex Products. and (e) to improve clarity and consistency.

Please check the terms and conditions whenever you use a Jagex Product. If you are not a subscriber, we will treat your continued use of a Jagex Product as acceptance of these changes from their effective date as shown above. If you are a subscriber, we will treat the first renewal date of your subscription after the changes as your acceptance of the changes. If you do not agree with the changes you should cancel your subscription (as explained below) before the renewal date.

5\. A SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT Preteens And Users Under 18

Some Jagex Products may have age restrictions which prevent users under 13 creating an account. If a Jagex Product is not subject to age restrictions, a user under 13 may create an account. However, they must get consent from their parents/guardians to use the Jagex Product in accordance with our terms and conditions and privacy policy. We may Stop any account if we are not satisfied that such consent has been given or that such consent does not comply with local laws regarding users who are under 13 years of age.

We do not knowingly collect or store any personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we find out that any personally identifiable information we have collected is from someone under 13, we will automatically delete it, and we may Stop the source account for that information.

We recommend that parents/guardians should play together with their children who are under the age of 13.

If you are under 18, by using our website you are representing (i.e. making a promise) that you have consent from your parents/guardian to use Jagex Products in accordance with our terms and conditions and privacy policy. We may Stop any account if we are not satisfied that such consent has been given.

If we are told by a parent/guardian that their child has lied about their age when registering for Jagex Products, we will Stop the account provided we have information which satisfies us that the reporting person is indeed the parent or guardian.

Parents can find more information about Jagex Products and how to contact us in the Parents' Guide.

6\. Safety and abuse

Before using any Jagex Product you should read Heath and Safety information and Safety and Security information. Parents of those under 18 should also review this information.

We are under no obligation to (and do not) monitor User Content. You should be aware of the potential risks of using a service which includes extensive User Content. User Content may be inaccurate, out of date or otherwise inappropriate. We cannot guarantee that users will comply with our terms and conditions, rules or otherwise behave appropriately. You should not assume that a person is who he or she claims to be. In your own interests, you should not attempt to contact any other user outside a Jagex Product.

If you are the victim of offensive or inappropriate behaviour or receive any other unwanted communications, you should use the built-in blocking facilities (as detailed in the Chatting and staying safe online section) to block the messages. You should report all inappropriate behaviour to us via the in game "Report abuse" button as well as seeking appropriate external help, for example from parents or law enforcement authorities. If you continue to suffer problems, or are not satisfied, then you must stop using the relevant Jagex Product(s).

We grant valid account holders a non-exclusive, non-transferable, personal, limited license, which can be revoked at any time, for the period of membership to use Jagex Products, to download and use our client software and to connect to our servers solely to use Jagex Products in accordance with these terms and conditions. The Jagex Products and any associated software are licensed, not sold. Your license confers no title or ownership to the Jagex Products or software.

You must not choose a username that infringes the rights of any third party, impersonates Jagex staff or other users, which is deliberately confusing, offensive, racist, obscene, hurtful, unlawful or otherwise inappropriate or which breaches the username requirements specified on our site or in our Rules of Conduct. We reserve the right to make such assessment in our sole discretion, change any username for any reason or take such other action as we believe appropriate.

You agree to keep your password safe at all times and not to disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for the activities of all persons who use your password to gain access to your account. To help ensure the safety of your password, you must keep your computer free of viruses and other malicious code including Trojans. You must use your password in accordance with the password requirements specified on our site and our Rules of Conduct. Real Jagex staff will never ask you for your password.

You agree to pay all subscription fees specified when you apply including all applicable taxes. Unless otherwise stated, all prices shown for EU countries include VAT.

By submitting your order you are making an offer to subscribe to the relevant part of the Jagex Product(s). Your offer is accepted and a binding contract occurs when we send a message to your account mail inbox confirming that your payment has been received or if you log into a subscribers-only part of a Jagex Product (whichever comes first).

All subscription payments will continue to be taken in advance at the relevant intervals (e.g. monthly in the case of monthly subscriptions) until you cancel your subscription (see below).

Payments by credit/debit cards are also subject to our credit card agreement which forms part of these terms and conditions.

We reserve the right to alter the amount or terms of our subscription fees at any time. This will only apply to those who, following the change, take out new subscriptions or re-subscribe (their previous subscriptions having expired) and specifically agree to the new fees/terms.

1.  **a. Cancelling your subscription**
    
    You may cancel your subscription at any time by clicking here or selecting the "Cancel Subscription" link from the account management section on the website of any Jagex Product.
    
    Upon cancellation you will not be charged any further subscription fees. No payments already made in respect of subscriptions or virtual currencies or items will be refunded (wholly or partly) but you can of course use up any unused membership credit in the account.
    
2.  **b. Right to cancel under Distance Selling Regulations**
    
    If you are an EU consumer, you may cancel your order within 7 (English) working days of placing it, in which case we will refund your subscription payment in full.
    
    You may cancel for this purpose by emailing or by giving us written notice as specified in the UK's Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000. (You can find these regulations by searching on www.opsi.gov.uk).
    
    However, this right of cancellation does not apply once you have started to use our subscription services, such as by logging in to a member's only world in which case you agree to performance of the contract starting before the usual cancellation period has expired.
    

14\. Virtual Currencies, Micro-Game Credits and virtual items

In certain Jagex Products, we offer Virtual Currencies and/or credits that can be redeemed to play micro-games ("Micro-Game Credits") for sale or, in our discretion, as free promotions. Virtual Currencies and Micro-Game Credits can be redeemed (i.e. used) to acquire certain digital goods/services, which we describe below as "Items". If you obtain Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits from Jagex, you must check that they have been correctly credited to your account and tell us immediately if not.

PLEASE TAKE NOTE that Virtual Currencies and Micro-Game Credits are subject to very important restrictions:

Virtual Currency and Micro-Game Credits may expire if they have not been redeemed within a certain period after acquisition, so you should redeem it as soon as possible. The expiry period is whatever we specify when you acquire the Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits or, if we haven't specified a time limit, twelve months from acquisition.

Unless we say otherwise on our website, Virtual Currency and Micro-Game Credits can only be redeemed within the world of the game where you acquired them. Each Jagex Product may contain one or more Virtual Currencies or Micro-Game Credits and unless otherwise stated, each Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credit is independent and is not exchangeable for any other Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credit in the same Jagex Product. We may at any time change or remove any Item which can be purchased using Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits, as well as change the amount of Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits needed to acquire a particular Item. You may only redeem Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits for Items on offer at the time of redemption.

Virtual Currency and Micro-Game Credits do not have any inherent value and are not your own private property. When you purchase or receive Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits, you do not own the Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits. Instead they constitute a measurement of the extent of your license in a Jagex Product. Similarly, any Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits balance shown in your account does not constitute a real world balance or reflect any stored monetary value.

You can only use Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits to acquire those Items which we decide in our discretion to offer in return for Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits. We do not provide any cash or refunds for Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits or Items (except as required by law) and Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits and Items do not have any real world monetary value. Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits are for your personal use only. You must not sell or transfer them or make them available to anyone else or attempt to do so, or encourage anyone else to do any of these things. Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits and Items can never be redeemed for real world money, goods or any other item of monetary value, and cannot be inherited. We may impose additional restrictions concerning the acquisition or redemption of Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits and Items. For example we may cap the amount of Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits which can be acquired or held or redeemed in any particular period or we may impose restrictions based on your country of residence. Certain Items may also only be available to certain persons, such as those who have separately acquired a subscription.

For the avoidance of doubt, Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits have no cash value, do not accrue interest and, unless otherwise required by law, are not redeemable or refundable for any sum of money or monetary value from Jagex at any time.

Jagex reserves the right to restrict access to, delete, reduce or liquidate Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits: (1) if you have misused the Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits or breached any of these terms and conditions. (2) if the Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits were awarded in error. (3) if a payment for Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits is charged back or otherwise cancelled or reversed. or (4) if you have used Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits to conduct any fraudulent or illegal activity.

Jagex reserves the right to restrict access to or delete virtual Items: (1) if you have misused the Items or breached any of these terms and conditions. (2) if the Items were purchased using Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits awarded in error. or (3) if a payment for Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits used to purchase the Items is charged back or otherwise cancelled or reversed. In addition, virtual Items that have been acquired by the redemption of Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits may expire after a period of time, which by default shall be twelve months from acquisition. In addition, Items may have particular restrictions, or be consumed or extinguished in the course of your use of Jagex Products.

We may at any time decide to end in part or its entirety the Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits and Items program for all or any of our Jagex Products. Before we delete the unused Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits, we will endeavour to contact you to give at least four weeks to redeem them.

1.  **RuneScape Bonds**
    
    Within the Jagex Product RuneScape, users can purchase a RuneScape Bond from Jagex. If you obtain a RuneScape Bond from Jagex, you must check that it has been correctly credited to your account and tell us immediately if not.
    
    RuneScape Bonds can be redeemed (i.e. used) to acquire RuneScape membership, Virtual Currency and/or Micro-Game Credits. we describe these collectively as "Redemption Items", Alternatively, RuneScape Bonds can be traded in-game with other users in return for virtual items. More information about RuneScape Bonds can be found here.
    
    PLEASE TAKE NOTE that RuneScape Bonds are subject to very important restrictions:
    
    RuneScape Bonds can only be traded and redeemed within RuneScape.
    
    We may at any time change or remove any Redemption Items which can be purchased using a RuneScape Bond, as well as change the amount of the RuneScape Bond needed to acquire a particular Redemption Item. You may only redeem the RuneScape Bond for Redemption Items on offer at the time of redemption.
    
    RuneScape Bonds: (i) do not constitute a real world balance or reflect stored monetary value. (ii) cannot be redeemed for real world money, goods or any other items with monetary value, and cannot be inherited. and (iii) are not your own private property. A RuneScape Bond is a measurement of the extent of your license in a Jagex Product.
    
    We do not provide any cash or refunds for RuneScape Bonds (except as required by law). We may impose additional restrictions concerning the acquisition or redemption of RuneScape Bonds. For example we may cap the amount of RuneScape Bonds which can be acquired or held or redeemed in any particular period or we may impose restrictions based on your country of residence.
    
    Jagex reserves the right to restrict access to, delete, reduce or liquidate RuneScape Bonds: (1) if you have misused the RuneScape Bond or breached any of these terms and conditions. (2) if the RuneScape Bond was awarded in error. (3) if a payment for a RuneScape Bond is charged back or otherwise cancelled or reversed. or (4) if you have used RuneScape Bonds to conduct any fraudulent or illegal activity.
    
    Jagex reserves the right to restrict access to or delete Redemption Items: (1) if you have misused the Redemption Items or breached any of these terms and conditions. (2) if the Redemption Items were purchased using RuneScape Bonds awarded in error. or (3) if a payment for RuneScape Bonds used to purchase Redemption Items is charged back or otherwise cancelled or reversed. In addition, Redemption Items that have been acquired by the redemption of RuneScape Bonds may expire after a period of time, which by default shall be twelve months from acquisition.
    
    Redemption Items may have particular restrictions, or be consumed or extinguished in the course of your use of Jagex Products.
    
    We may at any time decide to end part of or the entirety of the RuneScape Bond program for all or any of our Jagex Products. Before we delete the unused RuneScape Bond, we will endeavour to contact you to give you at least four weeks to redeem it.
    
    If your account for a Jagex Product remains dormant (i.e. is not used) for more than 12 months, and there is unredeemed Virtual Currency, Micro-Game Credits or RuneScape Bonds associated with your account, we may choose to credit your account with Items of equivalent value for this expired Virtual Currency, Micro-Game Credits or RuneScape Bonds.  We will endeavour to contact you by email prior to such action being taken.
    

15\. Refund policy

We are happy to review requests for refunds on a case by case basis. However, refunds are not always possible to give for many reasons.

Unless required by law, we will not refund any amounts paid in relation to subscriptions, macro-game activities, RuneScape Bonds, virtual items or virtual currency when:

*   You have been the victim of in-game scamming, as there are many warnings about avoiding this on the Jagex Products (however, we will do everything we reasonably can to assist you to recover your accounts).
*   You have been banned from a Jagex Product for violating these terms and conditions, any Rules of a Jagex Product or the user content policy.
*   Jagex stops offering the Jagex Product or you decide to cancel your subscription or account.

5\. A SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT Preteens And Users Under 18

Some Jagex Products may have age restrictions which prevent users under 13 creating an account. If a Jagex Product is not subject to age restrictions, a user under 13 may create an account. However, they must get consent from their parents/guardians to use the Jagex Product in accordance with our terms and conditions and privacy policy. We may Stop any account if we are not satisfied that such consent has been given or that such consent does not comply with local laws regarding users who are under 13 years of age.

We do not knowingly collect or store any personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we find out that any personally identifiable information we have collected is from someone under 13, we will automatically delete it, and we may Stop the source account for that information.

We recommend that parents/guardians should play together with their children who are under the age of 13.

If you are under 18, by using our website you are representing (i.e. making a promise) that you have consent from your parents/guardian to use Jagex Products in accordance with our terms and conditions and privacy policy. We may Stop any account if we are not satisfied that such consent has been given.

If we are told by a parent/guardian that their child has lied about their age when registering for Jagex Products, we will Stop the account provided we have information which satisfies us that the reporting person is indeed the parent or guardian.

Parents can find more information about Jagex Products and how to contact us in the Parents' Guide.

All subscription payments will continue to be taken in advance at the relevant intervals (e.g. monthly in the case of monthly subscriptions) until you cancel your subscription (see below).

Payments by credit/debit cards are also subject to our credit card agreement which forms part of these terms and conditions.

We reserve the right to alter the amount or terms of our subscription fees at any time. This will only apply to those who, following the change, take out new subscriptions or re-subscribe (their previous subscriptions having expired) and specifically agree to the new fees/terms.

14\. Virtual Currencies, Micro-Game Credits and virtual items

In certain Jagex Products, we offer Virtual Currencies and/or credits that can be redeemed to play micro-games ("Micro-Game Credits") for sale or, in our discretion, as free promotions. Virtual Currencies and Micro-Game Credits can be redeemed (i.e. used) to acquire certain digital goods/services, which we describe below as "Items". If you obtain Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits from Jagex, you must check that they have been correctly credited to your account and tell us immediately if not.

PLEASE TAKE NOTE that Virtual Currencies and Micro-Game Credits are subject to very important restrictions:

Virtual Currency and Micro-Game Credits may expire if they have not been redeemed within a certain period after acquisition, so you should redeem it as soon as possible. The expiry period is whatever we specify when you acquire the Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits or, if we haven't specified a time limit, twelve months from acquisition.

Unless we say otherwise on our website, Virtual Currency and Micro-Game Credits can only be redeemed within the world of the game where you acquired them. Each Jagex Product may contain one or more Virtual Currencies or Micro-Game Credits and unless otherwise stated, each Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credit is independent and is not exchangeable for any other Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credit in the same Jagex Product. We may at any time change or remove any Item which can be purchased using Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits, as well as change the amount of Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits needed to acquire a particular Item. You may only redeem Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits for Items on offer at the time of redemption.

Virtual Currency and Micro-Game Credits do not have any inherent value and are not your own private property. When you purchase or receive Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits, you do not own the Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits. Instead they constitute a measurement of the extent of your license in a Jagex Product. Similarly, any Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits balance shown in your account does not constitute a real world balance or reflect any stored monetary value.

You can only use Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits to acquire those Items which we decide in our discretion to offer in return for Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits. We do not provide any cash or refunds for Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits or Items (except as required by law) and Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits and Items do not have any real world monetary value. Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits are for your personal use only. You must not sell or transfer them or make them available to anyone else or attempt to do so, or encourage anyone else to do any of these things. Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits and Items can never be redeemed for real world money, goods or any other item of monetary value, and cannot be inherited. We may impose additional restrictions concerning the acquisition or redemption of Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits and Items. For example we may cap the amount of Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits which can be acquired or held or redeemed in any particular period or we may impose restrictions based on your country of residence. Certain Items may also only be available to certain persons, such as those who have separately acquired a subscription.

For the avoidance of doubt, Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits have no cash value, do not accrue interest and, unless otherwise required by law, are not redeemable or refundable for any sum of money or monetary value from Jagex at any time.

Jagex reserves the right to restrict access to, delete, reduce or liquidate Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits: (1) if you have misused the Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits or breached any of these terms and conditions. (2) if the Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits were awarded in error. (3) if a payment for Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits is charged back or otherwise cancelled or reversed. or (4) if you have used Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits to conduct any fraudulent or illegal activity.

In addition, virtual Items that have been acquired by the redemption of Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits may expire after a period of time, which by default shall be twelve months from acquisition. In addition, Items may have particular restrictions, or be consumed or extinguished in the course of your use of Jagex Products.

We may at any time decide to end in part or its entirety the Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits and Items program for all or any of our Jagex Products. Before we delete the unused Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits, we will endeavour to contact you to give at least four weeks to redeem them.

    RuneScape Bonds: (i) do not constitute a real world balance or reflect stored monetary value. (ii) cannot be redeemed for real world money, goods or any other items with monetary value, and cannot be inherited. and (iii) are not your own private property. A RuneScape Bond is a measurement of the extent of your license in a Jagex Product.

    We may at any time decide to end part of or the entirety of the RuneScape Bond program for all or any of our Jagex Products. Before we delete the unused RuneScape Bond, we will endeavour to contact you to give you at least four weeks to redeem it.
    
    If your account for a Jagex Product remains dormant (i.e. is not used) for more than 12 months, and there is unredeemed Virtual Currency, Micro-Game Credits or RuneScape Bonds associated with your account, we may choose to credit your account with Items of equivalent value for this expired Virtual Currency, Micro-Game Credits or RuneScape Bonds.  We will endeavour to contact you by email prior to such action being taken.
