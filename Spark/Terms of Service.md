**Date:** November 7, 2025

Key Changes to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy for Spark
----------------------------------------------------------------

At Spark, we greatly care about our users. As Spark evolves, we update our [Terms of Service](https://sparkmailapp.com/legal/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://sparkmailapp.com/legal/privacy-app) to ensure they remain clear and aligned with how the product works. 

As part of our ongoing commitment to transparency and improving your experience, we have revised these documents for better readability and structure. While the language and layout have been modernized, the core terms of our agreement with you remain unchanged. 

Here is a summary of the most important updates:

**Terms of Service**

*   **Subscription Plans:** The Terms of Service have been revised to align with Spark’s expanded subscription model and evolving service offerings.
*   **Individual & Business Use**: The Terms now provide clearer guidance for both individual users and business customers, reflecting how each may use Spark.
*   **Updated Refund Policy**: The Terms now provide clearer details on refund eligibility and the steps to request a refund.

**Privacy Policy**

*   **More details on Data Processing:** We have made the Privacy Policy easier to understand by grouping personal data into clear categories and detailing why we process it, on what legal basis, and for how long.

We encourage you to carefully review the [Terms of Service](https://sparkmailapp.com/legal/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://sparkmailapp.com/legal/privacy-app) in full. The changes take effect as of the date above.

These Terms of Service (“**Terms**”) govern your access to and use of the “Spark” mobile and desktop application (the “**App**”) and related [website](https://sparkmailapp.com/) services (collectively, the “**Service**”) provided by Spark Mail Limited (“**Spark**,” “**we**,” “**our**,” or “**us**”).  
  
We have two Privacy Policies that you should know about. Our [Privacy Policy for the App](https://sparkmailapp.com/legal/privacy-app) describes how we collect, use, and protect personal data in connection with your use of the App. The second one – [Privacy Policy for the website](https://sparkmailapp.com/legal/privacy-web)– is for our [website](https://sparkmailapp.com/).  
  
By accessing or using the Service, you (“**User**,” “**you**,” or “**your**”) acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not access or use the Service.  
  
If you have any questions or concerns regarding these Terms, please [contact us](#aboutus).

In this case,  all references to “you” and “your” shall refer to that entity. If you do not have the authority to bind such entity or do not agree with these Terms, you (and the entity) are not authorized to access or use the App.

Service and Use License
-----------------------

**_In brief_**

*   We grant you a license to use the Service, subject to these Terms;
*   The App is intended for two types of use: personal, non-commercial use by individuals, and use by a Business Customer's authorised users for internal business purposes, in accordance with the principles of fair and reasonable use;
*   You must not misuse or interfere with the proper functioning of the Service;
*   We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Service if you violate these Terms.

### Software Licence

Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you, an individual user, a limited, temporary, personal, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, revocable, non-transferable, and worldwide license to access and use the Service in the manner outlined in these Terms.

We may, at our discretion, provide upgrades, modifications, updates, or additions to the Service during the term of this license. Unless otherwise accompanied by a separate license or agreement, the terms of this license will apply to any such upgrades, modifications, updates, or additions.

If we reasonably believe that you have violated or may violate these Terms in a manner that could disrupt the Service, we may suspend or terminate this license and your access to the Service accordingly, without any liability to us, in addition to any other remedies available to us. We reserve all rights not expressly granted in these Terms.

### Business Customers

If you represent a company or other legal entity and wish to obtain access to the App and/ or purchase several subscriptions for your organisation's authorised users (“**Authorised Users**”), the organization you represent will become our customer (“**Business Customer**”). 

Subject to the Business Customer’s and its Authorised Users’ compliance with these Terms, and, as applicable, payment of the subscription fees, we grant the Business Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable right for its Authorised Users to access and use the Service for the Business Customer’s internal business purposes in accordance with these Terms. You acknowledge and agree that you are fully responsible for the acts and omissions of your Authorised Users to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable law.

### Acceptable Use

This App is provided for the personal, non-commercial use by individual users and the Business Customer’s Authorised Users, subject to the principles of fair and reasonable use.

Under the license granted to you, you shall not:

*   sell, lease, rent, license, sublicense, or otherwise distribute the App software, including sharing your personal Account in the App with others;
*   copy, decompile, disassemble, translate, or reverse engineer the App software, in whole or in part;

*   use the App in any manner other than for personal, non-commercial or internal business purposes.

We may implement usage limits if we detect usage patterns that significantly exceed typical user behavior or that we believe are detrimental to the overall performance and availability of the Service. We reserve the right to define what constitutes excessive and detrimental use and to implement appropriate limits without prior notice, though we will endeavour to communicate such actions where feasible.

### Modification or Discontinuation of the Service

We reserve the right to modify, suspend or discontinue all or any part of the Service at any time and without notice or liability, at our sole discretion. We will, however, provide prior notice if such changes are expected to materially diminish your use of the Service under a paid subscription plan. You agree that we shall not be liable to you or any third party should any of the preceding occur concerning the Service.

### Specific Access Restrictions

Account and Subscriptions
-------------------------

**_In brief_**

*   To use the App, you have to connect at least one email account to Spark.
*   The App is free to download.
*   You may use the free functionality of the App or purchase a subscription subject to a recurring fee.

The App is available for free download in desktop and mobile versions through our website and the third-party app stores, namely: [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1176895641), [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spark-mail-email-by-readdle/id997102246), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.readdle.spark&hl=uk&gl=US), [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/xpfcs9qjbkthvz?hl=en-US&gl=UA), [Huawei AppGallery](https://appgallery.huawei.com/#/app/C103789413) and [Setapp](https://setapp.com/).

Spark basic email functionality is free to use. To fully utilise more powerful functionalities of the App, you may need to subscribe to any of the available paid plans. Please note that the scope of functionality and available subscription options may vary across different platforms and device types. 

### Spark for Individuals and Teams

Spark is designed for two primary uses:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Spark Individual** | For individuals using Spark for personal productivity and managing their own email accounts. |
| **Spark Teams** | For companies, organizations, and private groups using Spark's collaborative features within a team in Spark (“**Team**”).<br><br>When you create a Team, you become a Team owner (“**Team Owner**”), and the members you invite and authorize to join your Team are your Team members (“**Team Members**”).<br><br>The authority to manage your Team, add or remove Team Members, and take other binding actions on your behalf depends on the role assigned to each Team Member. As the Team Owner, you agree that your Team Members are authorized to act within the permissions granted to their specific role. To learn more, please review the detailed permissions for each role in our [Help Center](https://sparkmailapp.com/help/spark-for-teams/team-roles). |

### Account

To use the App, you must have a personal account (“**Account**”), which you can use across your different devices. You can provide your email address or sign in with your Google account, after which your Spark Account will be associated with the first email account you connect to Spark. 

If you sign in via your email or your Team’s invitation, please click the button in our email to the indicated email address to confirm it and instantly sign in.

To ensure you retain full control over your Account, sharing and transferring it are strictly prohibited. If you know or have any reason to suspect that someone has gained access to your Account without your authorisation, your credentials have been lost, stolen, misappropriated, or otherwise compromised, please immediately [](https://pdfexpert.com/legal/terms#aboutus)[notify us](#aboutus).

To terminate your Account, you may use the relevant functionality in the App or reach out to us at [dpo@sparkmailapp.com](mailto:dpo@sparkmailapp.com).

### Free Use

Once you connect your email account to Spark, you acquire a free-of-charge license to use the App, subject to certain limitations shown in the App. These may include, for example, restrictions on usage volume and the availability of specific features. Please note that these limitations and features available for free use may be modified by Spark at any time without prior notice. 

### Free Trial and Special Offers

You can explore additional features available under the subscription during a free trial, subject to the then-current terms of the free trial offer displayed in the App or on the Website. 

Please note that if you start your free trial via an in-app Apple App Store or Google Play mechanism, or provide your credit card details at checkout, your subscription fee will be automatically charged after the free trial expires. To avoid charges, you must manually cancel the subscription at least 24 hours before the billing date. Please refer to the [Help Center](https://sparkmailapp.com/help/billing-subscription/how-to-cancel-free-trial-in-spark) to learn more about free trial cancellation on different platforms.

Within special promotional campaigns, Spark reserves the right to offer special terms to select users. The terms and conditions and duration of such offerings shall be defined in a separate promotion description and/or in the App.

### Paid Subscriptions and Add-Ons

You may purchase one of the paid subscriptions to access the extended functionality of the App, subject to the then-current terms. Please refer to the [Pricing page](https://sparkmailapp.com/plans-comparison) for more details on the subscription plans currently available for new users. Users on legacy subscription plans not specified on the [Pricing Page](https://sparkmailapp.com/plans-comparison) may continue to use them as long as they are supported. 

Your subscription may include a standard monthly usage allowance for AI Features (as defined below) that resets at the beginning of each billing cycle. For extra usage, add-ons are available as one-time, non-renewable, and non-refundable purchases. Unlike your standard monthly allowance that resets, any unused portion of a purchased add-on automatically rolls over to the next month.

The purchase of a subscription or add-on is subject to the then-current fee (including value-added tax (“**VAT**”), if applicable) as indicated on the checkout screen. Please note that if you pay in a currency that is different from the currency in which the fees are quoted, your bank may apply its current exchange rate and/or add commissions and fees on top of our subscription fees.

We reserve the right to change the subscription plans, including the scope of functionality available. We will provide you with adequate notice if the changes significantly diminish your use of the App under a paid subscription plan. Your continued use of the App after the effective date of such change will constitute your agreement to the changes.

Spark reserves the right to revise the fees at any time, giving users adequate notice of changes before they become effective. Please note that if your subscription is billed through the Apple App Store or Google Play, the respective platform will notify you of any price adjustments in accordance with their own policies. Your continued use of the App after the effective date of such change will constitute your agreement to pay the updated fees. If you do not agree to pay the updated subscription fees, you can cancel your subscription, and after that, you can continue using the App’s free-of-charge functionality only.

### Payment Terms

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Spark Individual** | **Billing Frequency**<br><br>Subscription fees are billed in advance on a recurring schedule, with billing periods typically established as monthly or annual. |
| **Stripe Purchases**<br><br>We use Stripe as a third-party payment processor for certain transactions ("Stripe Purchases"). If you purchase a subscription through our website, or via checkout integrated in the desktop App version, as well as those distributed through the Microsoft Store, Huawei App Gallery, your transaction is facilitated by Stripe under the latest [Terms of Service](https://stripe.com/legal/consumer) (or equivalent) and [Privacy Policy](https://stripe.com/privacy). In no case shall Spark be responsible for any personal data processed by Stripe.<br><br>The subscription fee includes applicable VAT and/or other taxes imposed under the relevant tax laws based on your location. |
| **Apple App Store and Google Play Purchases**<br><br>If you purchase a subscription via the Apple App Store or Google Play, your payment details are processed, and you are charged through the respective platform. <br><br>Please note that your subscription fee will be automatically charged after the end of your then-current subscription period, unless you cancel it in your device settings at least 24 hours before the billing date. |
| **Setapp Store Subscription**<br><br>Certain Spark subscription plans may be available through your [Setapp](https://setapp.com/) subscription. If you access Spark through Setapp, please note that your payments, renewals and cancellations are processed by and subject to Setapp's own terms and policies. Your license to use Spark is valid only as long as you maintain an active subscription with Setapp. |
| **Spark Teams** | **Billing Frequency and Prorations**<br><br>Subscription fees are billed in advance on a recurring schedule, with billing periods typically established as monthly or annual.<br><br>The subscription fee is calculated on a monthly basis per the number of active Team Members in accordance with the rates specified on the checkout screen. An active Team Member is a person who has joined your Team via invitation or automatically (based on email domain name). If the number of active Team Members changes during a month, billing adjustments will be made in accordance with [Stripe’s prorations rules](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/prorations). Adding a Team Member will incur a prorated charge for the remainder of the subscription term, while removing a Team Member will result in a prorated credit to your Account balance that automatically offsets future subscription fees and/ or prorations. Please note that upon the deletion of your Team, termination or cancellation of your subscription, any outstanding credits on your Account will be forfeited. The payment for the number of active Team Members that has exceeded the original number as of the initial subscription start date will be charged once per month. If you have any questions regarding prorations, please contact our support at: [support@sparkmailapp.com](mailto:support@sparkmailapp.com). <br><br>Please note that each Team Member has the capacity to invite new Team Members. This action does not require approval from the Team Owner or other Team Member with administrative rights. <br><br>The Team Owner will be notified immediately via email when a new Team Member joins. It is the Team Owner’s responsibility to remove any unapproved Team Members to prevent future charges for that seat. |
| **Stripe Purchases**<br><br>All payments for Teams subscriptions are facilitated by our third-party payment provider, Stripe. Please note that Teams subscriptions can only be purchased and managed through our Website interface. This is the exclusive method for handling a Teams subscription, even if you have downloaded the App from the Apple App Store or Google Play. Please refer to our [Help Center](https://sparkmailapp.com/help/spark-for-teams/how-to-upgrade-spark-to-premium) for more details.<br><br>For Teams subscriptions, prices are listed exclusive of VAT or any other taxes. Any applicable taxes will be displayed at checkout depending on your location, and you will be responsible for paying all applicable indirect taxes as required by law. |

By purchasing a subscription via any of the abovementioned means, you agree to be charged for this purchase,  future renewals of your subscription, and, as applicable, Teams subscription prorations. Your payment card will be automatically charged at the applicable renewal rate unless you cancel your subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period.

Please note that if we record a chargeback or other rejection of payment of any due and payable subscription fees charged through Stripe, this will be considered a breach of payment obligations hereunder. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Services and/ or your Account at our sole discretion.

### Subscription Renewal and Cancellation

Your subscription will automatically renew, and you will be charged a subscription fee for the subsequent subscription period at the then-current rates unless you cancel it at least 24 hours before the billing date.

You may cancel your subscription at any time; however, cancellation will take effect at the end of the then-current subscription period. This will not terminate your Account, and you will retain access to the App's free-of-charge functionalities after the end of your subscription period.

|     |     |

However, if you subscribed through the Apple App Store or Google Play, you must cancel it manually to avoid future charges. <br><br>Please refer to the Refunds section below to understand the eligibility requirements for a refund. |
| **Spark Teams** | The Team Owner can cancel the Team subscription manually through the Team settings, or by notifying us at [billing@sparkmailapp.com](mailto:billing@sparkmailapp.com) at least 5 business days prior to the end of the then-current subscription period. |

### Refunds

If you have any problems with the functioning of the App, please contact us, and we will make every effort to help you.

**Apple App Store and Google Play Purchases**

Purchases made through the Apple App Store and Google Play may be refunded by contacting these platforms’ support directly and requesting a refund. 

Please note that the Apple App Store and Google Play process all refund requests according to their own policies and eligibility criteria. Spark has no control over Apple's refund decisions and cannot be held responsible if your request is denied.

**Stripe Purchases** 

An individual subscription purchased through Stripe may be cancelled and refunded **within 30 calendar days** from the date of purchase. To request a refund, please contact us.

We will initiate a full refund of the subscription fee paid by you to Spark without undue delay using the same means of payment you used for the initial transaction.

Please note, however, that if you cancel your subscription after the 30-day period, you will not receive a refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period at the time of cancellation, unless required by law.

You acknowledge and agree that any commissions, fees, or charges imposed by your bank or payment system in connection with a refund, including but not limited to transfer or withdrawal fees, are outside of our control and responsibility. We will refund the agreed-upon amount, and we shall not be liable for any reduction in that amount due to such third-party charges.

This refund policy does not apply to Business Customers. All fees associated with business subscriptions are non-refundable.
