Terms Of Service
================

_Last Updated: February 13, 2025_

OpenSea is owned and operated by Ozone Networks, Inc., doing business as OpenSea ("OpenSea," "we," "us," or "our"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of our technology and services, which include the OpenSea website(s), APIs, mobile applications, and all related tools, features, and functionalities (collectively, the "Platform").

For purposes of these Terms:

* "NFT" refers to a non-fungible token or similar digital item that is secured and authenticated on a public blockchain. NFTs are generally governed by smart contracts that define ownership and transferability.
* "Use" includes accessing, viewing, interacting with, or otherwise engaging with the Platform, whether passively or actively. This encompasses actions such as visiting the Platform, browsing content, creating an Account, conducting transactions, or utilizing any services or features.
* "You" refers to any user of the Platform. If you are using the Platform on behalf of an entity, "you" also includes the entity.

Important: Please Read Carefully

These Terms contain important information about your legal rights and obligations. Section 13 includes a mandatory arbitration agreement and a class action waiver, requiring most disputes to be resolved through individual arbitration rather than in court.

By clicking "Accept," signing up, or using the Platform, you confirm that you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, you may not use the Platform.

Contents

1. What OpenSea Is (and Isn't)
    
    OpenSea operates as a peer-to-peer web3 platform that helps users discover and directly interact with blockchain-based items, including NFTs and fungible tokens, as well as engage with other participants across public blockchains. OpenSea is not a wallet provider, exchange, broker, dealer, financial institution, payments processor, money services business, or creditor.
    
    We do not have custody or control over the digital tokens, blockchains, or third parties you engage with, nor do we execute or facilitate purchases, transfers, or sales of NFTs or other tokens.
    
2. [Updates to the Terms](#updates-to-the-terms)
    
    OpenSea reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time, at our sole discretion. If material changes are made, we will provide reasonable notice, such as updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of these Terms or providing a notice through the Platform. By continuing to use the Platform after changes are made, you confirm your acceptance of the revised Terms.
    
    It is your responsibility to periodically review the Terms to ensure you understand the latest terms and conditions that apply to your use of the Platform.
    
3. [Using the Platform](#using-the-platform)

    * OpenSea has no custody or control over your wallet or its contents, and we cannot retrieve or transfer its contents.
    * You are solely responsible for securing your wallet, including keeping your credentials and seed phrase confidential. If you encounter wallet issues, you must contact your wallet provider.
    
    By using your wallet in connection with OpenSea, you agree to abide by the terms and conditions of the wallet provider.
    
    **Account Security and Responsibility**  
    Your Account security is your responsibility. OpenSea is not liable for any actions or omissions by you or others that may compromise your Account. If you suspect any security issues related to your Account or the Platform, you agree to notify OpenSea immediately (contact us [here](https://support.opensea.io/)).
    
    **Electronic and Promotional Communications**  
    By creating an Account, you consent to receive electronic communications from OpenSea, including emails, push notifications, text messages, and other forms of communication. These communications may include:
    
    * Transactional and account-related notices (e.g., updates about your Account or activity on the Platform).
    * Promotional communications that we believe may be of interest to you.
    
    You understand that:

    * You are subject to sanctions imposed by the U.S. Government, any other government, or the United Nations.

    These representations must remain true for the duration of your use of the Platform. You further agree not to enable access to or use of the Platform for any natural or legal person that falls into any of the categories above.
    
    **Requests for Additional Information**  
    OpenSea may require you to provide additional information and documents in certain circumstances, such as upon request by the government or to comply with applicable laws or regulations. OpenSea may restrict or disable your Account until these requests are satisfied. Failure to provide complete and accurate information may result in permanent access restrictions.

4. [OpenSea's Ownership of the Platform](#openseas-ownership-of-the-platform)
    
    **OpenSea's Intellectual Property**  
    All proprietary elements of the Platform are owned by OpenSea. This includes:
    
    * The Platform's "look and feel," such as text, graphics, images, logos, page headers, button icons, URLs, scripts, and other design elements that make up the Platform.
    * Digital content, including the OpenSea logo, designs, text, graphics, pictures, data, software, sound files, and other files.
    * OpenSea's trademarks, service marks, and trade dress.
    * The selection, arrangement, and presentation of all such materials.
    
    OpenSea and its licensors retain all rights to these materials, including the exclusive right to create derivative works. You may not:
    
    * Copy, imitate, or use OpenSea's name, logo, trademarks, or service marks.
    * Use metatags or other hidden text that reference "OpenSea" or its intellectual property.
    
    **License to Use the Platform**  
    OpenSea grants you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, nonsublicensable, and personal license to access and use the Platform, subject to your compliance with these Terms. This includes:
    
    * Accessing and displaying any software, content, or materials made available by OpenSea solely for your personal, non-commercial use as permitted under these Terms.
    * Downloading a copy of the OpenSea mobile application to your device solely to enable your use of the Platform.
    
    This license is strictly limited to your lawful use of the Platform. OpenSea does not grant any ownership rights through this license, and your use of content linked to or associated with NFTs, NFT collections, or other digital items is subject to any applicable rights set forth by the seller or creator of the NFT or such other digital item.
    
    **Third-Party Intellectual Property**  
    All other trademarks and intellectual property mentioned on or integrated by the Platform are the property of their respective owners. This includes:
    
    * Trademarks, logos, and other intellectual property associated with third-party creators of NFTs or related content.
    * Smart contracts and other software code deployed by third parties.
    
    OpenSea does not claim ownership over such third-party intellectual property and disclaims responsibility for their operation, functionality, or legality. Reference to third-party products, services, or content on the Platform does not imply endorsement, sponsorship, or recommendation by OpenSea.
    
5. [Third-Party Content](#third-party-content)
    
    **Third-Party Content**
    
    The Platform may include links or access to third-party websites, applications, code, or other content ("Third-Party Content"). OpenSea uses the CoinGecko API, which is the property of Gecko Labs Pte. Ltd., to display its Third-Party-Content about fungible tokens on the Platform.
    
    OpenSea does not control, endorse, or review Third-Party Content and is not responsible for it. You are cautioned that third-party applications may be decentralized or "open" in nature, where no recourse is available.
    
    By using or relying on Third-Party Content, you do so entirely at your own risk. OpenSea provides access to Third-Party Content as a convenience and makes no warranties or representations regarding its functionality, availability, or reliability. You bear sole responsibility for verifying the legitimacy, authenticity, and legality of NFTs or other digital items you purchase.
    
    Additionally, we cannot guarantee that any NFT or digital item visible on OpenSea will remain visible or available for purchase, sale, or transfer. Creators, sellers, and buyers are solely responsible for the content and metadata associated with their NFTs or other digital items.
    
    **Public Blockchains**
    
    As a peer-to-peer web3 service, OpenSea helps you explore NFTs and other digital items created by third parties and interact with public blockchains and blockchain applications, which are not owned by OpenSea. Public blockchains facilitate the creation, transfer, and ownership of NFTs and other digital items, but OpenSea does not control or guarantee the availability, functionality, or permanence of these networks or the NFTs or other digital items existing on them.
    
    **Third-Party Transactions and Terms**
    
    These Terms govern only your use of OpenSea's Platform. NFTs and other digital items exist on public blockchains and are purchased, sold, and transferred outside of OpenSea.
    
    Sellers are responsible for determining and establishing the price of NFTs and other digital items, including applicable taxes, mint counts, and minting mechanics. OpenSea does not control or set these terms.
    
    For its services, OpenSea may receive certain fees. However, OpenSea does not set, collect, enforce, or determine other costs or fees associated with buying or selling NFTs or other digital items, including but not limited to:
    
    * Creator earnings or royalties.
    * Blockchain transaction fees (commonly referred to as "gas fees").
    * Payment processor or other third-party fees.
    
    These fees are paid directly to third parties, such as creators, sellers, or blockchain validators, and OpenSea cannot refund these amounts.
    
    NFTs and other digital items may also be subject to specific terms and conditions set by their creators, sellers, or buyers (referred to as "NFT Terms"). These terms, which may include rights and obligations associated with NFT content, are not established or enforced by OpenSea. For example:
    
    * When you view NFT metadata or additional details on OpenSea, you may encounter third-party links to NFT Terms.
    * Buyers, sellers, and creators are solely responsible for communicating, agreeing to, and enforcing any such NFT Terms.
    * It is your responsibility to review and comply with any applicable NFT Terms.

    * You are responsible for the content and metadata associated with your NFTs and digital items, including ensuring that they do not contain infringing material unless you have obtained the required permissions or are otherwise legally entitled to post the material.
    
    **Grant of License to OpenSea**  
    By using the Platform in conjunction with creating, submitting, posting, promoting, or displaying content (including compliance with OpenSea's metadata standards), you grant OpenSea a worldwide, non-exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-free license to:
    
    * Use, copy, modify, and display your content for current and future business purposes, including providing, promoting, and improving the Platform.

    **Note:** OpenSea does not claim ownership of your content, other than Feedback as defined below. The license you grant allows us to use and display your content to operate and improve our Platform, but ownership remains with you.
    
    **Your Feedback**
    
    OpenSea welcomes feedback, comments, and suggestions for improving the Platform (“Feedback”). By providing Feedback, you:
    
    * Acknowledge that it does not grant you any ownership or rights in the Platform or the Feedback itself.
    * Assign to OpenSea all rights, title, and interest in the Feedback, including intellectual property rights such as patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets.

7. [Intellectual Property Violations and Ownership Disputes](#intellectual-property-violations-and-ownership-disputes)
    
    **Illegal Content and Disputed Items**  
    OpenSea complies with applicable laws regarding illegal content, including intellectual property violations and stolen NFTs. To report illegal content or submit DMCA and DSA takedown notices, review and follow the instructions in our **Illegal Content and Disputed Items Policy**.
    
    OpenSea facilitates the discovery of and interactions with blockchain-based items, including NFTs. However, OpenSea does not adjudicate disputes regarding the ownership, authenticity, or legality of any item listed or transacted on the platform. If a dispute arises concerning an item, such disputes will be handled in accordance with our Illegal Content and Disputed Items Policy, which may include restricting the visibility or transferability of the item on the platform.
    
    Users acknowledge and agree that OpenSea's actions to address disputes are based solely on our internal policies and are not determinations of ownership or legal rights.
    
    OpenSea reserves the right to restrict or remove visibility of NFT collections, individual NFTs, related metadata, or other digital assets or related content at its discretion, including for legal compliance, policy enforcement, or other reasons. You acknowledge that such restrictions may impact the accessibility and perceived value of an NFT or other digital item.
    
8. [User Conduct](#user-conduct)
    
    OpenSea values openness and inclusivity, aiming to provide users from diverse backgrounds with a vibrant way to explore web3 and blockchain-based assets. However, to ensure a safe and lawful environment, we reserve the right to take action, with or without prior notice, if we determine at our sole discretion that you have violated these Terms or may be using the Platform for unlawful activities. Such actions may include:

    * Not to use or attempt to use another user's account without their authorization.

9. [Promotional Programs](#promotional-programs)
    
    Subject to your ongoing compliance with these Terms and any applicable Rewards Program Terms (defined below), OpenSea may, at its sole discretion, offer you the opportunity to participate in a limited points-based program (the "Rewards Program").
    
    Through the Rewards Program, OpenSea may allocate digital points ("Points" or "XP") to users for completing specific tasks or interactions within the Platform. Points are provided as an enhancement to Platform users to incentivize participation in our community.

    The Rewards Program is intended for personal use only; commercial or automated participation is prohibited. Your participation in the Rewards Program constitutes your acceptance of these Terms, any additional terms applicable to the Rewards Program ("Rewards Program Terms"), as may be modified or updated by OpenSea in its sole discretion.
    
    **Modifications**. OpenSea reserves the right to modify, suspend, or terminate the Rewards Program, in whole or in part, at any time, with or without notice. Such changes may affect the distribution or calculation of Points, changes to the tasks required to earn Points, the ways in which the Points can be redeemed (if at all), the ability to earn, use, or retain previously accumulated Points, and the leaderboard. OpenSea makes no representations or warranties regarding the continued availability of Points, the ability to use or redeem Points, or the existence of any associated benefits.
    
    **Leaderboard**. A leaderboard will be available on the Platform, showcasing users who have accumulated the most Points. You can track your Points and progress by logging into your Account.
    
    **Points**

    * Points are not a currency, asset, or property right; they have no cash or cryptocurrency value; and they cannot be redeemed for cash or any cash equivalent.

    * OpenSea does not guarantee that you or any participant will receive or be eligible to receive any minimum amount of Points by participating in the Rewards Program.

    * OpenSea does not guarantee or control any third-party initiatives, including any potential use of Points by third parties. Any allocation of third-party tokens or benefits based on Points is at the discretion of the third party and is not the responsibility of OpenSea. OpenSea disclaims all liability for the actions or decisions of any independent organizations in relation to the Rewards Program.
    
    **Special Offers and Promotions**. From time to time, OpenSea may introduce special offers, bonuses, or challenges that allow you to earn additional Points. Each special offer may be subject to separate terms and conditions, which will be made available at the time of the offer. These terms may differ from the general Rewards Program Terms, so be sure to review them before participating. OpenSea reserves the right to modify, restrict, or terminate any special offers at any time.
    
    **Expiration**. Points accumulated in the Rewards Program are subject to expiration, reset, or modification at OpenSea's discretion. OpenSea reserves the right to determine when and how Points expire, are adjusted, or are reset, including but not limited to expiration at the end of designated time periods ("Waves").
    
    **Termination of Participation**. OpenSea reserves the right to terminate your participation in the Rewards Program at its discretion, including for any breach of these Terms, misuse of or fraudulent activity within the Rewards Program, or for any other reason deemed appropriate by OpenSea.

    * Disputes over ownership or validity of NFTs and other digital items visible on OpenSea.

    **Disclaimers**  
    Your use of the Platform is at your own risk. The Platform is provided on an AS IS and AS AVAILABLE basis, and OpenSea expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express or implied, including but not limited to:

    * Vulnerabilities, failures, or abnormal behavior of other software (e.g., smart wallets).
    
    Note: Some jurisdictions may not allow certain disclaimers, so these limitations may not apply to you.
    
    **Assumption of Risk**  
    By using the Platform, you acknowledge and accept the following risks, in addition to risks described elsewhere in these Terms:
    
    1. NFT and Crypto Volatility: The value of NFTs and other digital items (such as fungible tokens) is subjective and highly volatile. You understand that you may lose money.
    2. Blockchain and Transaction Fees: You are responsible for all blockchain-related fees, which are final and non-refundable.
    3. Disputed Ownership: NFTs and other digital items visible on OpenSea may be subject to ownership disputes.
    4. Ecosystem Risks: The utility and value of NFTs and other digital items depend on the adoption and growth of blockchain ecosystems, which may fail to develop as anticipated.
    5. Regulatory Risks: The regulatory landscape for NFTs, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technologies is uncertain and may negatively affect the Platform or the utility of NFTs and other digital items.
    6. Tax Obligations: You are solely responsible for determining, withholding, reporting, and remitting any applicable taxes arising from your transactions on the Platform, including your NFT and token sales, purchases, swaps, transfers, or other digital item transactions, and you agree to indemnify OpenSea in connection with any such taxes. This responsibility extends to any taxes that may be associated with other activities on the Platform, such as those related to any promotional programs or any other benefits you may receive related to your use of the Platform. OpenSea does not provide tax advice and does not determine the taxability of any rewards or transactions. OpenSea will not be liable for any of your tax obligations.
    7. Internet and Security Risks: Using the Platform may expose you to risks such as internet disruptions, malicious attacks, or unauthorized access to your wallet or Account.
    8. Third-Party Dependencies: The Platform relies on third-party vendors and services, and any disruptions with these providers may negatively impact your experience.
    9. Content Visibility: OpenSea reserves the right to hide or make inaccessible collections, contracts, or items affected by these risks or other issues. This includes items that become unviewable or inaccessible due to blockchain-related issues.
    
    **Limitation of Liability**  
    To the fullest extent permitted by law:
    
    * OpenSea, its affiliates, and its service providers shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages, including but not limited to lost profits, revenue, data, or goodwill, arising out of or related to your use of the Platform.
    * OpenSea's and its affiliates' total liability for any claims arising out of or related to these Terms or your use of the Platform shall not exceed the greater of:
        * $100, or
        * The amount OpenSea directly received from you in connection with the transaction that gave rise to the claim.
    
    The limitations above apply even if the stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.
    
    Exceptions: Some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for certain damages, so these limitations may not apply to you.
    
13. [Arbitration Agreement](#arbitration-agreement)
    
    Please read this section, setting forth the Arbitration Agreement carefully. It affects your legal rights by requiring that you and OpenSea resolve any and all disputes with OpenSea through binding arbitration rather than in court, subject to the limited exceptions described below. This section applies to disputes between you and OpenSea and does not govern disputes between users or third parties. OpenSea does not provide dispute resolution services for disagreements between users or third parties, which must be resolved independently.
    
    **Agreement to Arbitrate**  
    You agree that any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or related to your use of the Platform, products sold or distributed through the Platform, or your relationship with OpenSea will be resolved on an individual basis exclusively through binding arbitration, except:
    
    1. Small Claims Court: Claims that qualify may be resolved in small claims court, provided they remain on an individual basis.
    2. Intellectual Property Claims: Claims involving intellectual property infringement or misuse may be resolved in a court of proper jurisdiction.
    
    Both you and OpenSea agree to make good-faith efforts to resolve disputes informally before initiating arbitration or other legal proceedings.
    
    **Informal Dispute Resolution**  
    Before commencing arbitration, you must initiate an informal dispute resolution process by sending a written notice describing your claim and desired resolution to:
    
    OpenSea, Attn: Legal Department  
    66 W Flagler St, Suite 929,  
    Miami, FL 33130, USA
    
    Both parties agree to meet and confer (via telephone, videoconference, or in person) to attempt to resolve the dispute in good faith. The statute of limitations and any filing deadlines will be tolled during this process. If the dispute is not resolved within 30 days, either party may proceed with arbitration, small claims court, or legal claims for intellectual property issues.
    
    **Delegation**  
    Any dispute between OpenSea and you regarding the construction, interpretation, or application of this Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, severability, revocability, scope, or validity of this Arbitration Agreement, shall be decided by an arbitrator and not by a court or judge.
    
    **Arbitration Process**
    
    * Rules and Forum: Arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider, under its Streamlined Arbitration Rules (for claims under $250,000) or Comprehensive Arbitration Rules (for claims above $250,000). JAMS rules are available at jamsadr.com or by calling 800-352-5267.
    * Filing and Costs: If JAMS is unavailable, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. OpenSea will pay JAMS filing and administrative fees for claims under $10,000, unless (a) your claim results in a judgment smaller than OpenSea's prior settlement offer or (b) the arbitrator deems the claim frivolous.
    * Hearing Format: Arbitration may be conducted via telephone, videoconference, written submissions, or in person at a mutually agreed location.
    
    The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration agreement. Judgments rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court with proper jurisdiction.
    
    **Arbitrator Authority**  
    The arbitrator has the exclusive authority to:
    
    * Determine the scope and enforceability of this arbitration agreement.
    * Resolve disputes related to the interpretation, applicability, or formation of this agreement.
    
    The arbitrator may award the same relief on an individual basis that a court could award, including monetary damages and injunctive relief. All decisions are final and binding.
    
    **Waiver of Jury Trial and Class Actions**
    
    * Jury Trial Waiver: By agreeing to this arbitration agreement, you waive your constitutional and statutory rights to sue in court and have a trial before a judge or jury.
    * Class Action Waiver: All claims must be brought on an individual basis. Claims of more than one party cannot be arbitrated or consolidated without written consent from all parties. Class arbitrations are expressly prohibited.
    
    If a court finds that this class action waiver is unenforceable for a specific claim, that claim must be litigated in court, while other claims proceed in arbitration.
    
    **Severability and Survival**
    
    * If any part of this arbitration agreement is found invalid or unenforceable, that part will be severed, and the remainder will remain in effect.
    * This arbitration agreement survives termination of your relationship with OpenSea.
    
    **Modification of Arbitration Terms**  
    If OpenSea makes material changes to this arbitration agreement, you may reject the changes within 30 days of their effective date by notifying OpenSea in writing at:
    
    OpenSea, Attn: Legal Department  
    66 W Flagler St, Suite 929,  
    Miami, FL 33130
    
    If you reject the changes, the prior version of this arbitration agreement will remain in effect.
    
14. [Governing Law and Venue](#governing-law-and-venue)
    
    These Terms and your access to and use of the Service shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (without regard to conflict of law rules or principles of the State of New York, or any other jurisdiction that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction). The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply.
    
    Any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration as set forth in Section 13 or cannot be heard in small claims court, shall be resolved in the state or federal courts of New York County in the State of New York, and the United States, respectively, sitting in the State of New York.
    
15. Termination
    
    OpenSea reserves the right to suspend, restrict, disable, terminate, or delete your Account or your access to the Service (in whole or in part) at any time, with or without notice, and for any or no reason. If your Account is terminated, you will not be entitled to any refunds for amounts already paid to OpenSea.
    
    All licenses granted to you under these Terms will terminate automatically if you breach these Terms. OpenSea shall not be liable for any damages or obligations arising from such termination.
    
    All provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination, including but not limited to ownership, indemnification, disclaimers, limitations of liability, dispute resolution, and export compliance, will remain in effect.
    
16. [Miscellaneous Terms](#miscellaneous-terms)
    
    **Severability**  
    If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be severed, and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.
    
    **Remedies for Breach of Terms**  
    You agree that any breach of these Terms may result in irreparable harm to OpenSea, for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy. OpenSea is entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunctive relief, without the need to post a bond or provide additional security.
    
    **California Residents**  
    If you are a California resident, in accordance with Cal. Civ. Code § 1789.3, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112 Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.
    
    **Entire Agreement**  
    These Terms, along with any policies incorporated by reference, constitute the entire agreement between you and OpenSea regarding your use of the Service and supersede all prior agreements or understandings.
    
    **Assignment**  
    You may not assign or transfer your rights under these Terms without OpenSea's prior written consent. OpenSea may freely assign its rights and obligations.
    
    **Waiver**  
    The failure of either party to assert any right or enforce any provision shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.
    
    **Interpretation**  
    Section headings are for reference only and do not affect the interpretation of these Terms. For purposes of this these Terms, (a) the words "include," "includes," and "including" will be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation"; (b) the word "or" is not exclusive; (c) the words "herein," "hereof," "hereby," "hereto," and "hereunder" refer to these Terms as a whole; and (d) unless the context otherwise requires, defined terms in the singular shall include their plural forms, and defined terms in the plural shall include their singular forms. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in these Terms: (x) to "Sections" refer to the sections of these Terms; (y) to an agreement, instrument, or other document means such agreement, instrument, or other document as amended, supplemented, and modified from time to time to the extent permitted by the provisions thereof; and (z) to a statute means such statute as amended from time to time and includes any successor legislation thereto and any regulations promulgated thereunder. These Terms will be construed without regard to any presumption or rule requiring construction or interpretation against the party drafting an instrument or causing any instrument to be drafted.
    
    **Third-Party Beneficiaries**  
    Except as explicitly provided in these Terms or Apple's EULA (e.g., Apple as a third-party beneficiary for App Store-related terms), these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and do not create rights for third parties.
