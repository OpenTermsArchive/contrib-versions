By accessing, using, registering for or receiving any of the Services, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of these TOU and to the Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy, which are incorporated herein by reference.

-------------------------------------------------------------

If you are a minor, that means under the age of legal majority in your country, and are not an emancipated minor (in countries that permit this), you must have your parents’ or guardian’s consent to enter into these TOU and to use the Services, and by using the Services you are confirming that you have received that consent.

4F. Do you check my account and my posts?
-----------------------------------------

You acknowledge that we have no obligation to monitor your access to or use of the Services for violations of the TOU or to review or edit any content. However, we have the right to do so for the purpose of operating and improving the Services (including without limitation for fraud prevention, risk assessment, investigation and customer support purposes), to ensure your compliance with the TOU and to comply with applicable law or the order or requirement of a court, consent decree, administrative agency or other governmental body. We can also block or respond to content that we determine is otherwise objectionable or as set forth in the TOU. In addition, you acknowledge that we have your consent to monitor and block content that we consider to be harassing or bullying.

4G. Can you block any content I posted if I broke the rules?
------------------------------------------------------------

We reserve the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any content for any reason or no reason. Some of the reasons we may remove or disable access to content may include finding the content objectionable, in violation of the TOU or otherwise harmful to the Services or our users.

We are aware that some people may use harsh language when communicating with friends during informal conversation, so we consider this and such forms of casual speech when assessing if content is intended to cause offence, or not. We also have to think about whether the question is open or anonymous, if the content is within a shoutout, what a recipient’s reaction is or could be, any user reports on the content or user reports about any profile. We try to take a full view of any situation, meaning we also consider the full context, and the age of the users involved.

We may also send warnings before disabling any content or profile, to give you a chance to improve your behaviour on ASKfm.

If you find your content has been removed, or your profile has been blocked or banned, you can contact our support team via the contact form or email for an explanation. It is important to learn from negative behaviour and our support team may, in certain situations, be able to advise you why your content or profile has been removed, blocked or banned. We respect your right to express yourself freely on the Internet, which is why we believe that you deserve to know why certain actions may have been taken by us against your account or your content, if we are able to tell you. Sometimes, it may not be possible for us to tell you why we have taken action against your content for legal or security reasons. If content has been removed by us, even if we have had discussions with you and agree to reinstate the content, unfortunately we cannot restore the exact post, picture or video. If your profile has been blocked, we have the discretion to restore the whole profile only within the first 90 days after the profile termination, so if you don’t agree with your profile removal, it is important to contact us and explain why you think we have made a mistake. It is our platform and our responsibility to try and make it as safe as possible, so remember that although you can contact us to discuss things, the final decision about what is allowed or not on ASKfm is ours.

4H. Who can see what I post?
----------------------------

When you post or upload anything on the Services, it can be seen or accessed by the general public (not just registered members) as further described in our [Privacy Policy](https://about.ask.fm/legal/en/privacy.html). An important thing to remember is that we may access, preserve or disclose any of your information, if we are required to do so by law or if we believe in good faith that it is reasonably necessary to (i) respond to claims asserted against us or to comply with legal process (for example, subpoenas or warrants), including those issued by courts having jurisdiction over us or you, (ii) enforce or administer our agreements with users, such as these TOU; (iii) for fraud prevention, risk assessment, investigation, customer support, providing the Services or engineering support, or (iv) protect the rights, property or safety of ASKfm, the users of the Services, or members of the public.

4I. Can I report bad content and what will ASKfm do about it?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Anyone can report potential violations of our policy. ASKfm users can report the exact post from the feed, question from inbox, visible chat message or the whole profile. If the moderation team receives a user report for things including but not limited to violence, extremism, self-harm, sexual exploitation of minors, child human trafficking, grooming and other serious illegal offenses, we report these cases to Law Enforcement and/or NCMEC (National Center for Missing and Exploited Children). Please check the list of our Safety Tools here.

Profiles which are created only for the prohibited activities or for distribution of prohibited content and spam will be banned straight away and are not welcome on ASKfm. We have an internal violation counter and special algorithms helping to define offending profiles and ban them from using ASKfm.

5\. Content and features
========================

5A. Does ASKfm own my content once I post it online?
----------------------------------------------------

If you submit material to the Services, unless we indicate otherwise, you grant us a perpetual (for questions you ask only), non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully-paid-up, and fully sub-licensable right to access, view, use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, copy, and display such material throughout the world in any form, media, or technology now known or hereafter developed. You also permit any other user to view, copy, access, store, or reproduce such material for that user’s personal use.

You represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the material that you submit; that the material you submit is truthful and accurate; and that use of the material you supply does not violate these TOU, the rights of any third party, or any applicable laws.

Upgrades or updates of the Ask coins Deduction may be made available from time to time.

7\. Can you ever change these terms of use?
===========================================

We may, at any time and for any reason make changes to these TOU. We may do this for a variety of reasons, including to reflect changes in or requirements of the law, new features, or changes in business practices. The most recent version of the TOU will be posted on the Services, and you should regularly check for the most recent version. The most recent version is the version that applies. If the changes include material changes that affect your rights or obligations, we will notify you of the changes by reasonable means, which could include notification through the Services or via email. If you continue to use the Services after the changes become effective, then you shall be deemed to have accepted those changes. If you don’t agree to these changes, you must end your relationship with us (without penalty) by ceasing to use the Services and leaving the Services. Additionally, if we update or upgrade the Services, you may be required to accept the most recent version of the TOU to access the updated or upgraded Services.

8\. How can I or ASKfm deactivate or terminate my account?
==========================================================

(a) How do I deactivate my account?
-----------------------------------

If you are a registered user of the Services, you can deactivate your membership at any time by going to the Settings control when you are logged in and choosing the “deactivate profile” link. By deactivating your account, it will no longer be visible to other users of the Services, but we will save your profile information in case you change your mind later and want to reactivate your account. Many members deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and in doing so expect us to maintain their information until they return to the Services. You should, therefore, be able to restore your account and the whole of your profile within 12 months of deactivating it, but we cannot guarantee that this will always be the case.

(b) How do I actually terminate my account, not just deactivate it?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Should you choose to leave the Services, rather than deactivate your account, you may do so by selecting the “I want to leave ASKfm” tab on the [Contact Us](http://support.ask.fm/) page. Once received, we will process your request to leave as soon as practicable. Once processed, your profile data will be removed from the Services and your questions to friends will be converted to anonymous questions (in other words, questions you have asked will remain visible but will appear to be from an anonymous user). You will be able to reactivate your account by logging back in for a period of 30 days after your request to leave the Services is processed. At the end of that period, your account will be deleted and all “likes” which you have added to questions will be removed. We will delete your data as soon as reasonably practicable, but in certain cases, limited types of data, including log files and backups, may take up to 90 days to be fully deleted.

Warning: After you have deactivated your account or left the Services, questions may still appear on the Services, but will be anonymized and no longer associated with you directly (in other words, a question you asked on your friend’s profile will still be visible, but will not include your username). Please note also that even after you remove information from your profile or deactivate your account, copies of such content may still be visible and/or accessed on the Internet to the extent such information has been previously shared with others, or to the extent such information has been shared with, indexed by or cached by search engines. Similarly, if you have given third-party applications or websites (e.g., social networks) access to your personal information, they may keep that information. We cannot control this, nor do we accept any responsibility or liability for this.

(c) Can you suspend or terminate my account if you want to?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Yes, we can. We may suspend or terminate a user’s access to the Services or a member’s account for any reason, including if we believe a user has violated these TOU. We also reserve the right to at any time block users from accessing and using the Services by using IP blockers or other technological solutions we deem appropriate. If we have grounds to terminate your access to the Services due to a violation of these TOU (including your breach of the Rules of Conduct), we reserve the right to terminate your access to the Services without notice. Otherwise, we will provide you with reasonable notice, if your access to the Services and/or your profile is going to be suspended or terminated.

(d) What are the effects of termination?
----------------------------------------

Upon termination or expiration of your rights to use the Services or any portion thereof, you authorize us to delete any files, programs, data and messages associated with your account for the Services, or applicable portion thereof, without notice to you.

9\. What’s the important legal stuff I need to know?
====================================================

9A. We give you a limited licence to use the Services
-----------------------------------------------------

We grant you a personal, limited, revocable, non-exclusive and non-transferable license to access and use the Services only as expressly permitted in these TOU. You shall not use the Services for any illegal purpose or in any manner inconsistent with the provisions of these TOU.

9B. We make changes to the Services or update it if we choose to
----------------------------------------------------------------

We reserve the right to change or discontinue any aspect of the Services or all the Services at any time without notice to you. Upgrades or updates of the Services may be made available from time to time. We do this to improve the quality of the Services that we provide to you and other users. The software or the software application store that makes the software available for download may include functionality to automatically check for updates or upgrades to the software. Unless your device, its settings or computer software does not permit transmission or use of upgrades or updates, you agree that we or the applicable software application store may provide notice to you of the availability of such upgrades or updates and automatically push such upgrade or update to your device or computer from time to time. You may be required to install certain upgrades or updates to the software in order to continue to access or use the Services or portions thereof (including upgrades or updates designed to correct issues with the Services). Any updates or upgrades provided to you by us under the TOU shall be considered part of the Services.

9C. What if I participate in Surveys or Features/Product Testing
----------------------------------------------------------------

From time to time, ASKfm may offer you the opportunity to participate in a user survey or feature/product test (“Evaluation”). If you agree to participate in an Evaluation, you agree that ASKfm may collect your ideas, feedback, answers, suggestions, comments, designs and other materials in any medium (collectively “Materials”). You further agree that ASKfm owns the Materials in perpetuity and exclusively throughout the world, and you assign to ASKfm all rights you have or may have in the Materials as well as any ideas or information the Materials may generate in the future. You represent and warrant that ASKfm’s ownership and use of the Materials do not and will not violate the rights of any third party or any applicable laws. You unconditionally waive in favor of us all moral rights in respect of the Materials.

9D. Intellectual Property Rights
--------------------------------

(a) The Services are proprietary and are protected by copyright laws, international treaty provisions, trademarks, service marks, and other intellectual property laws and treaties. The Services are also protected as a collective work or compilation under copyright and other laws and treaties. You agree to abide by all applicable copyright and other laws as well as any additional copyright notices or restrictions contained in the Services. You acknowledge that the Services contain original works and have been developed, compiled, prepared, revised, selected, and arranged by ASKfm and others through the application of methods and standards of judgment developed and applied through the expenditure of substantial time, effort, and money and constitutes valuable intellectual property of ASKfm and such others. You agree to protect the proprietary rights of ASKfm and all others having rights in the Services during and after the term of this agreement and to comply with all reasonable written requests made by ASKfm or its suppliers and licensors of content or otherwise to protect their and others’ contractual, statutory, and common law rights in the Services. ASKfm neither warrants nor represents that your use of materials displayed on the Services will not infringe rights of third parties not owned by or affiliated with ASKfm. You agree to immediately notify us upon becoming aware of any claim that the Services infringe upon any copyright, trademark, or other contractual, statutory, or common law rights by following the instructions contained below. All present and future rights in and to trade secrets, patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, know-how, and other proprietary rights of any type under the laws of any governmental authority, domestic or foreign, including rights in and to all applications and registrations relating to the Services shall, as between you and ASKfm, at all times be and remain the sole and exclusive property of ASKfm.

(b) The trademarks, logos, taglines and service marks (collectively, the “Trademarks”) displayed on the Services are registered and unregistered Trademarks of ASKfm and others. Nothing contained in the Services should be read as granting any Trademark without the written permission of ASKfm or such third party that may own the Trademarks. Other than as provided in the TOU, in particular, this section, your use of the Trademarks or any other ASKfm content is strictly prohibited. You are also advised that ASKfm will enforce its intellectual property rights to the fullest extent of the law.

9E. How do you handle Copyright Claims? 
----------------------------------------

It is our policy to respond to clear notices of alleged copyright or other IP rights infringement, and in appropriate circumstances and at our discretion, to disable and/or terminate the accounts of users who may infringe or repeatedly infringe the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of ASKfm and/or others.

(a) Notice for Claims of Intellectual Property Violations and Agent for Notice.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This process is for copyright and intellectual property matters only and is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to ASKfm as straightforward as possible, while also providing ASKfm with the necessary information for notice verification. If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement or that your intellectual property rights have been otherwise violated, please provide ASKfm’s Copyright Agent with a written communication containing the following information in English (your “Notice”):

Note: If you are asserting infringement of an intellectual property right other than copyright, you should specify the intellectual property right at issue.

1\. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;

2\. A detailed description sufficient to identify the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed, or if multiple works have been infringed, a representative list of such works on the ASKfm site;

3\. A description of the material that you claim is infringing and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate this material on the ASKfm site (as part of this information, you must provide us with the specific URL where the material is located);

4\. Information sufficient for ASKfm to contact you, including your username (if applicable), address, telephone number, and/or email address;

5\. A statement by you that you have a good-faith belief that the disputed use of the material is not authorized by the copyright or intellectual property owner, its agents, or the law;

6\. A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury (if you are located in the US) or made truthfully (if you are located elsewhere) that the information in this notice is accurate and that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner for the material or that you are authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual property owner’s behalf.

(b) What happens to my copyright claim notice?
----------------------------------------------

In some circumstances, in order to notify the subscriber, account holder or host who provided the allegedly infringing content to which ASKfm has disabled access (or intends to disable access), ASKfm may forward a copy of your notification including your name and contact information to the subscriber or account holder. The individual may choose to file a counter-notification explaining why the content does not infringe an IP right following receipt of our notice. We may also, in our sole discretion, post a notice or a copy of your complaint on our site. By providing us with a complaint, you are consenting to your complaint being forwarded to the subscriber, account holder or host who provided the allegedly infringing content, and/or to our posting a notice or copy of your complaint on our site.

(c) What if I change my mind or make a false copyright claim?
-------------------------------------------------------------

After submitting a copyright or other IP right, infringement notification, you may realize that you misidentified content or you might otherwise change your mind. ASKfm will honour retractions of copyright or other IP claims from the party who originally submitted them. It is important that you do not make false claims. Submitting a claim of copyright or other IP right infringement is a serious matter with legal consequences. Before you report a claim of copyright or other IP right infringement to us, you may wish to reach out to the individual posting the content. You may be able to resolve the issue simply by bringing it to their attention without contacting us at all. If you are unsure whether the content you are reporting is infringing your legal rights, you may wish to seek legal guidance. Keep in mind that submitting intentionally misleading reports of infringement may be punishable under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in the United States or similar laws in other countries.

(d) Who is the ASKfm copyright agent for DMCA purposes?
-------------------------------------------------------

For the purpose of the DMCA, ASKfm’s Agent for notice of claims of copyright or other intellectual property infringement can be reached as follows:
