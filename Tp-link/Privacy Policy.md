The term “Services” means the Sites, Web Apps, Mobile Apps, and Subscription Services, which may be used in conjunction with Products and in other ways provided by TP-Link. Some Products and Services of TP-Link can be used together or in ways that integrate with products and services from third parties.

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully as it explains how we collect information, how we use the information we collect, and with whom we disclose such information.
