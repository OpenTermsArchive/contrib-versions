Last Updated: Feb 28, 2022

TP-Link Corporation Limited and its affiliates (collectively, “TP-Link,” “we” “us,” or “our”), takes your privacy seriously. TP-Link provides:

(1) TP-Link branded hardware, firmware, and software products (“Products”), (2) website(s) that may be accessed at [https://www.tp-link.com](https://www.tp-link.com/) , [https://www.kasasmart.com](https://www.kasasmart.com/) , [https://www.tapo.com](https://www.tapo.com/) and [https://www.vigi.com](https://www.vigi.com/) (“Sites”), (3) services, including on and through the Products, and technical support and services accessible through the Site(s) (“Web Apps”), (4) software that may be downloaded to your smartphone or tablet to access services (“Mobile Apps”), and (5) subscription services, including services that can be accessed using the Web Apps and Mobile Apps (“Subscription Services”). The term “Services” means the Sites, Web Apps, Mobile Apps, and Subscription Services, which may be used in conjunction with Products and in other ways provided by TP-Link. Some Products and Services of TP-Link can be used together or in ways that integrate with products and services from third parties.

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully as it explains how we collect information, how we use the information we collect, and with whom we disclose such information. By using or accessing our Products and Services in any matter, you consent to the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy incorporates herein the Terms of Use; both statements should be read in conjunction with each other.

### **1\.** **INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

You have the right to request: access to your data, data portability, erasure of your data, the rectification of any errors, to place restrictions on processing and you can also object to the processing of your data. Where you have given consent to any data processing, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.

1.1 Personal Information

**Geolocation Data**

This includes a broad geographic location (e.g. country or city-level location). We collect this information directly from your device.

**Financial Information**

We will collect your payment information when you buy our products or a subscription to use one of our Software Services or a warranty replacement programs. We collect this information directly from you.

**Video/Audio Storage**

When you subscribe to Cloud Services that include storage of audio and video captured by your Products, we will store your audio and visual data for your reference and use. The length of storage is dependent on your Products and/or Services.

You may also provide other information that potentially could be used to identify you, such as the names and images that you associate with account users, devices, scenes, device configuration details, certain demographic information, third-party account credentials, and schedules.

Further, we may also collect information when you upload, post, or share your information on our Products and Services, or through our Sites. For example, you may post information in a public space on our Sites.

1.2 Usage Statistics

We collect information about you when you access or use our Products and Services. For example, when you connect hardware devices or third-party services to your account, those hardware devices may report usage information to the Services, and the Services may read, process, and store this information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Such information is usually associated with the usage of the particular hardware device or third-party service, such as when a motion sensor senses motion. The Services will receive information about the device activation, as well as the information that you have chosen to associate with the Product or Service such as device name, group name, and location name. The type of the Product or Service from which information is received will change the types and quantities of information that is received.

We also collect the information about how you interact with our Site and Services, which may include the pages accessed and links clicked on our site, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, MAC address, access times, location, mobile device information, operating system, browser type, certain demographic information, application information, and other information associated with how you interact with the Site and Services. We will collect a device’s browser history and access time when the device is under the control of the Parental Control feature, such as the Parental Control feature on the Deco Products, in order to better monitor the device which is under control. We will record and analyze a device's attempted URL connections and block access to malicious websites (such as phishing / fraud / fake websites) only when the device has the Real-Time Protection feature enabled. Data will no longer be collected after you turn off this feature.

**Internet or Other Network Activity Information**
