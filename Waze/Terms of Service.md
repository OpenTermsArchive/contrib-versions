These Terms constitute a fully binding agreement between you and Waze Mobile Ltd. including its Google affiliates and subsidiaries (“Waze” or “We”), the proprietor of all rights in and to the Service, and you. It is therefore recommended that you carefully read these Terms.

In addition, we also publish a [Privacy Policy](https://support.google.com/waze/answer/12075406). Although it’s not part of these Terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand what information we collect about you when you are using the Service and how we use your information.

### KEY POINTS 

The following key points of the Terms are highlighted here for your convenience only. These key points are not made in lieu of the full Terms and their presence in this section does not mean that they are intended to supersede or override any other terms or conditions provided by Waze.

Road information prevails. The information provided by the Service is not intended to replace the information provided on the road, such as travel direction, time based restrictions, lane restrictions, road blockades, traffic signs, traffic lights, police instructions, etc.

Cautious driving. Always drive vigilantly according to road conditions and in accordance with traffic laws. It is strictly forbidden to hold a mobile device in hand, to send traffic updates (such as updates on road accidents and traffic congestion), or to non-verbally interact with the Service or use the Service in a non-verbal manner for any purpose other than navigation while driving. Traffic updates or non-verbal reports you want to submit to the Service may only be sent after you have stopped your vehicle in an appropriate location permitted by law. Alternatively, such updates may be sent by a passenger other than the driver, provided it does not interfere with the due course of driving and does not distract the driver’s attention to the road.

Non-continuous updates. The information provided by the Service originates from other users of the Service. Such information is intrinsically fluctuant and may be inaccurate, incomplete or outdated. Waze does not provide any warranties to such information’s credibility or reliability.

Location-based Service. Some features of the Service make use of detailed location and route information, for example in the form of GPS signals and other information sent by your mobile device on which the Waze application is installed and activated. These features cannot be provided without utilizing this technology. For more details, please see our [Privacy Policy](https://support.google.com/waze/answer/12075406).

Waze allows you to use the Service whether or not you choose to set up a username for yourself. If you choose to use the Service without setting up a username you may do so by skipping the username setup stage of the application installation process. However, please note that Waze will still link all of your information with your account and a unique identifier generated by Waze in accordance with the [Privacy Policy](https://support.google.com/waze/answer/12075406). Note that in order to access certain features of the Service (for example map editing, ranking, moods) you will need to set up a username.

Advertisements. Third party advertisements may appear on the Service from time to time. Waze does not endorse these advertisements, and the advertisements are not intended to be, nor should they be, viewed by drivers unless and until their vehicle has come to a complete stop.

The Internet connection required to use the Service, and any associated charges (e.g. mobile data expenses) incurred by your use of the Service are your exclusive responsibility and made solely at your expense. Transmitting and receiving real-time updates to and from the Service, requires an online (e.g. Wi-Fi, 3G, 4G) connection between your cellular device and the Internet. The expenses of such connection are as prescribed by the agreement between you and your communication service provider (such as your cellular company), and according to its applicable terms of payment.

Your age. The Service is intended for use by users who are of the legal age required to hold a driving license. In any case, to use our Service you must be 16 years of age or older. If you are under 16, you may not download or use the Service. If Waze is notified or has a reasonable reason to believe that an account belongs to a user who is under the age of 16 years, the account  will be deleted without further notice.

Privacy. Your privacy is important to us. The [Privacy Policy](https://support.google.com/waze/answer/12075406) explains our practices pertaining to the use of your personal information and we ask that you read such Privacy Policy carefully.
