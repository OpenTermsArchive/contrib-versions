### KEY POINTS

The following key points of the Terms are highlighted here for your convenience only. These key points are not made in lieu of the full Terms and their presence in this section does not mean that they are intended to supersede or override any other terms or conditions provided by Waze..

*   **Road information prevails**. The information provided by the Service is not intended to replace the information provided on the road, such as travel direction, time based restrictions, lane restrictions, road blockades, traffic signs, traffic lights, police instructions, etc.
    
*   **Cautious driving**. Always drive vigilantly according to road conditions and in accordance with traffic laws. It is strictly forbidden to send traffic updates (such as updates on road accidents and traffic congestion), or to non-verbally interact with the Service or use the Service in a non-verbal manner for any purpose other than navigation while driving. Traffic updates or non-verbal reports you want to submit to the Service may only be sent after you have stopped your vehicle in an appropriate location permitted by law. Alternatively, such updates may be sent by a passenger other than the driver, provided it does not interfere with the due course of driving and does not distract the driver’s attention to the road.
    
*   **Non-continuous updates**. The information provided by the Service originates from other users of the Service. Such information is intrinsically fluctuant and may be inaccurate, incomplete or outdated. Waze does not provide any warranties to such information’s credibility or reliability.
    
*   **Location-based Service**. Some features of the Service make use of detailed location and route information, for example in the form of GPS signals and other information sent by your mobile device on which the Waze application is installed and activated. These features cannot be provided without utilizing this technology. Please note, as described in detail in the [Privacy Policy](https://www.waze.com/legal/privacy):
    
    *   Waze uses your location and route information to create a detailed route history of all of your journeys made when using the Service.

    *   Waze allows you to use the Service whether or not you choose to set up a username for yourself.
