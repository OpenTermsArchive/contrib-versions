==================

This policy explains how Waze Mobile Limited and its affiliates (“Waze”) uses cookies and your related choices. For more information on other ways we collect and use information from you and your use of our services, please see our [Privacy Policy](https://www.waze.com/legal/privacy). In this policy we use the term “cookies” to refer to any applicable tracking technologies described herein.

WHAT ARE COOKIES?
-----------------

*   **A cookie** is a small piece of text sent to your browser by a website you visit. It helps the website to remember information about your visit, like your preferred language and other settings. That can make your next visit easier and the site more useful to you. Cookies play an important role. Without them, using the web would be a much more frustrating experience.
*   **A pixel tag** is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
*   **Single Sign-on** allows you to log in to certain of websites or mobile applications using sign-in services provided by third parties, such as Facebook or Google. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our [sign-up form](https://www.waze.com/signin?redirect=%2F).

HOW WE USE COOKIES?
-------------------

**Below you can see a list of the types of cookies used by Waze. You can also find out how Waze and our partners use cookies in advertising.**

### Processes

Process cookies help the website to work and deliver services that the website visitor expects, like navigating around web pages or accessing secure areas of the website. Without these cookies, the website cannot function properly.

### Preferences

These cookies allow our websites to remember information that changes the way the site behaves or looks, such as the region you are in. For instance, by remembering your region, a website may be able to provide you with relevant language preferences. These cookies can also assist you in changing text size, font, and other parts of web pages that you can personalize.

Loss of the information stored in a preference cookie may make the website experience less functional but should not prevent it from working.

### Authentication

We use these cookies to help us show you the right information and settings when you are logged-in to our website.

### Security

We use security cookies to authenticate users, prevent fraudulent use of login credentials, and protect user data from unauthorized parties.

### Session State

Websites often collect information about how users interact with a website. This may include the pages users visit most often and whether users get error messages from certain pages. We use these so-called ‘session state cookies’ to help us improve our services, in order to improve our users’ browsing experience. Blocking or deleting these cookies will not render the website unusable.

### Advertising

Depending on your setting, we permit third-party ad partners (see a list below) to use cookies and other technology from this site to market our services to you on other websites and online services you visit. These cookies also may help to limit the number of times that you see an ad and help us measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.

### Analytics

Google Analytics is Google’s analytics tool that helps website and app owners to understand how their visitors engage with their properties. It may use a set of cookies to collect information and report website usage statistics without personally identifying individual visitors to Google. The main cookie used by Google Analytics is the ‘\_\_ga’ cookie.

In addition to reporting website usage statistics, Google Analytics can also be used, together with some of the Advertising cookies described above, to help show more relevant ads on Google properties (like Google Search) and across the web and to measure interactions with the ads we show.
