* **A cookie** is a small piece of text sent to your browser by a website you visit. It helps the website to remember information about your visit, like your preferred language and other settings. That can make your next visit easier and the site more useful to you. Cookies play an important role. Without them, using the web would be a much more frustrating experience.
* **A pixel tag** is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
* **Single Sign-on** allows you to sign in to certain of websites or mobile applications using sign-in services provided by third parties, such as Google. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our [sign-up form](https://www.waze.com/signin?redirect=%2F).

HOW WE USE COOKIES?
-------------------

**Below you can see a list of the types of cookies used by Waze.**

### Processes

Process cookies help the website to work and deliver services that the website visitor expects, like navigating around web pages or accessing secure areas of the website. Without these cookies, the website cannot function properly.

### Preferences

These cookies allow our websites to remember information that changes the way the site behaves or looks, such as the region you are in. For instance, by remembering your region, a website may be able to provide you with relevant language preferences. These cookies can also assist you in changing text size, font, and other parts of web pages that you can personalize.

Loss of the information stored in a preference cookie may make the website experience less functional but should not prevent it from working.

### Authentication

We use these cookies to help us show you the right information and settings when you are signed in to our website.

### Security

We use security cookies to authenticate users, prevent fraudulent use of Sign in credentials, and protect user data from unauthorized parties.

### Session State

Websites often collect information about how users interact with a website. This may include the pages users visit most often and whether users get error messages from certain pages. We use these so-called ‘session state cookies’ to help us improve our services, in order to improve our users’ browsing experience. Blocking or deleting these cookies will not render the website unusable.

### Analytics

Google Analytics is Google’s analytics tool that helps website and app owners to understand how their visitors engage with their properties. It may use a set of cookies to collect information and report website usage statistics without personally identifying individual visitors to Google. The main cookie used by Google Analytics is the ‘\_\_ga’ cookie.
