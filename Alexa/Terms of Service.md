**1.1. Alexa.** An Alexa Enabled Product and internet connection are required to access and use Alexa. Some Alexa services may not be available in all areas or on all Alexa Enabled Products and may require separate subscriptions.

**1.2 Use of the Software.** You may use the Software only on or through an Alexa Enabled Product or Auxiliary Product, and you may only make personal and non-commercial use of Alexa. For additional terms that apply to the Software, see the software terms contained in the Amazon.com Conditions of Use and the terms contained in the Legal &. Compliance section in the Help menu of your Alexa App.

**1.3 Alexa Interactions.** You control Alexa with your voice. Alexa streams audio to the cloud when you interact with Alexa. Amazon processes and retains your Alexa Interactions, such as your voice inputs, music playlists, and your Alexa to-do and shopping lists, in the cloud to provide, personalize, and improve our services. Learn more about these voice services including how to delete voice recordings associated with your account.

**1.4 Voice Purchasing.** Alexa allows voice purchasing of physical and digital products and services, including subscriptions, from Amazon and other sellers using your default Amazon payment and shipping settings (an “Amazon-Processed Purchase”). You can require a speakable confirmation code, turn off all voice purchasing or turn off voice purchasing only in kid skills, and see product and order details for Amazon-Processed Purchases in your Alexa App. Learn more. By default, your approval will be required for each voice purchase from Amazon through a kid skill. You consent to receive automated text messages from us requesting those approvals. To opt out of these automated text messages, you may change your voice purchasing settings for kid skills in your Alexa app. Your voice purchasing settings may not apply to purchases that are not Amazon-Processed Purchases (such as when you provide a credit card directly to the provider of a Third-Party Service), and we are not a party to, and have no responsibility for, those purchases. Amazon-Processed Purchases are subject to the Amazon.com Privacy Notice, Amazon.com Conditions of Use, and, in the case of a subscription, the terms for the applicable service.

If you make an Amazon-Processed Purchase of, or start a free trial for, a subscription, your subscription will automatically continue at the applicable subscription price at the end of the free trial period (if any) and each renewal period, unless you notify us before a charge that you want to cancel or do not want to automatically renew your subscription. You authorize us (without notice to you, unless required by applicable law) to collect the subscription price and any taxes using any payment method we have on record for you. For any subscription to an Amazon service, please see the terms of use for that service for applicable cancellation, pricing, and refund terms. For any Amazon-Processed Purchase that is a subscription to a Third Party Service, (i) we or the third party may cancel the subscription at any time, for example, if the applicable service is no longer available, in which case you will receive a prorated refund, and(ii) terms and prices may change from time to time, effective as of the beginning of the next subscription term.

Alexa also allows you to make donations to eligible charities by voice. When you make a donation, Amazon Pay will process the donation using your default Amazon payment settings and will share your name, address, and email with the charity.

You can find more information about Amazon-Processed Purchases and donations in our Alexa and Alexa Device FAQs, including applicable terms, return and refund policies, and how to cancel subscriptions.

**1.5 Automatic Voice Recognition &. Voice Profiles**. Alexa can automatically recognize the voices of users in your household over time to improve personalization of certain Alexa features. You can also create a voice profile, so Alexa can call you by name and do more to personalize your experience. When Alexa recognizes your voice automatically, or when you create a voice profile, Alexa uses recordings of your voice to create an acoustic model of your voice characteristics. If Alexa recognizes your voice when you are using a third-party skill, that skill may receive a numeric identifier that allows it to distinguish you from other users in your household to better personalize your experience. You can turn off automatic voice recognition, turn off personalization of third-party skills based on recognized voices, or delete any voice profile you’ve created.  Learn more about voice profiles.

AMCS LLC (“AMCS”), an affiliate of Amazon, may offer you certain Alexa-related communication services, such as the ability to send and receive messages and calls and connect with other Alexa users, and the ability to place outbound calls to phone numbers (collectively, “Alexa Communication”). This schedule is part of the Alexa Terms of Use and you agree to these terms when you register for or use Alexa Communication. Your use of Alexa Communication is also subject to the Alexa Communication Usage Guidelines, which are part of this schedule. AMCS and its affiliates may offer services other than Alexa Communication, which are not covered by this schedule and may be subject to other terms.

**1.1 General.** Your messages, communications requests (e.g., “Alexa, call Mom”), and related interactions are “Alexa Interactions,” as described in the Alexa Terms of Use. Amazon processes and retains your Alexa Interactions and related information in the cloud in order to respond to your requests (e.g., “Send a message to Mom”), to provide additional functionality (e.g., speech to text transcription and vice versa), and to improve our services. We also store your messages in the cloud so that they’re available on your Alexa App and select Alexa Enabled Products. You or other call participants may be able to ask Alexa to help with certain functions during a call, such as “Alexa, volume up” and “Alexa, hang up.” Certain Alexa Communication services are provided by our third party service providers, and we may provide them with information, such as telephone numbers, to provide those services. Alexa Communication is only available on select Alexa Enabled Products, and features may vary. Learn more.

Your phone number also may be displayed as a caller ID on your outbound calls to phone numbers.

**1.3 Contacts.** Amazon will periodically import and store your contacts to improve your Alexa Communication experience. Amazon uses information about your contacts and connections, including who you communicate with the most, to provide and improve our services. For example, we use this information to identify most likely call recipients (e.g., when you ask “Alexa, call Bill,” Alexa can better identify which Bill you want to contact).

You should ensure you can contact your relevant emergency services providers through a mobile, landline telephone, or other service.

**1.5 Drop In.** The optional Drop In feature allows permissioned users to instantly connect to your Alexa Enabled Products for a voice or video chat without you needing to take any action. If you grant Drop In permission to yourself, anyone in your household also receives Drop In permission. and if you grant Drop In permission to a contact, anyone in that contact’s household also receives Drop In permission. Users with Drop In permission may see an indicator to let them know if your device has been recently active. This indicator is based on your Alexa Interactions, and motion sensors on Echo Show. Learn more.

**1.6 Fees.** AMCS does not currently charge fees for Alexa Communication, but reserves the right to place limitations on use of certain services or features, including subscription or other fees. You and/or the recipient of your calls or messages may be required to pay carrier fees for data usage. AMCS has no responsibility for such fees.
