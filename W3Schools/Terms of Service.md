Domains
-------

We provide a domain purchasing service that seamlessly integrates with the W3Schools web hosting and development platform ("Spaces"). It allows you to search, select, and purchase a domain that automatically links to your Spaces.

When you buy a domain, you become its sole owner and must follow all related terms and conditions.

W3Schools works with third-party providers, such as Amazon and its Route 53 services, for domain registration and distribution. You can review their terms here:

* [Amazon Route 53 Domain Registration Agreement](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/domain-registration-agreement/)
* [Amazon Registrar Policy Page](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/amazon-registrar-policies/)
* [Gandi Contract Page](https://www.gandi.net/en/contracts/terms-of-service)

As the distributor, W3Schools handles purchasing and billing. If you have any complaints, claims, or concerns about these third-party products, please contact us at [support@w3schools.com](mailto:support@w3schools.com).

The mutual agreement for a domain renews automatically each year. If you don't want to continue with a domain purchase from us, you must cancel the renewal before the end of the current agreement. See the [Billing and Account Information](#billing_and_account_information) section for more billing information.

We are not liable for any harm, errors, or omissions caused by the domain registry administrator's actions, including domain registration or renewal requests. Before purchasing a domain, please review all associated third-party policies and practices to ensure you understand their terms.

If we need to change or cancel an order, we will email you using the email address you provided at the time of purchase.

Please know that you agree to provide current, complete, and accurate purchase and account information for all orders made through our website. You must keep your account details updated at all times, including your email address and payment method, so we can process your transactions and contact you if needed.
