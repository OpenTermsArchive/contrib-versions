We maintain the right to cancel and withhold the refund if you do not accept the related requirements.

W3Schools are responsible for the purchasing and billing related to the distribution. The domain gets renewed automatically every year and agree that you have understood that you have to actively cancel the renewal to opt out of the service. You can read more about billing in the section Accuracy of Billing and Account Information.
