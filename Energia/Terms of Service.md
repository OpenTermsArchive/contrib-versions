5.6 Energia will notify you if your Energy consumption is in excess of what we reasonably deem to be appropriate for a domestic customer. In the event that your consumption exceeds the threshold for a reasonable domestic customer, Energia reserves the right to change you to a Tariff that would be more appropriate for your consumption.

#### 

6\. Terms Of Payment

6.1 Except where otherwise specified in the Product Terms Sheet, Energia will send you an invoice on a bi-monthly basis (the “**Invoice**”) setting out the Charges payable and any other amounts due under this Agreement, together with any applicable VAT or replacement or other tax and you will pay such amounts by cleared funds within 14 days of the date of the Invoice.

6.2 The Invoice shall contain a breakdown of the amount of Energy consumed on the Premises.

6.3 Invoices shall be paid by the method set out in the Product Terms Sheet or by one of the methods set out on the back of the invoice, on Energia’s website or as described in Energia’s Code of Practice on Billing. If you do not provide a direct debit instruction; withdraw a direct debit instruction; or do not pay by one of the agreed payment methods, Energia may change the frequency of your bills and alter the Tariff accordingly, and/or may require you to pay a security deposit in accordance with Clause 7.

6.4 You shall not deduct or set-off any payments to be made under this Agreement against any amounts due to you for other services provided.

6.5 If any amount payable by you is in genuine dispute, you must pay to Energia the amount that is not in dispute. When the matter has been settled, the amount owed by you may be adjusted as a result. If you also have an account with Energia at another premises, any credit or debit may be transferred between your accounts by Energia, in order to recover any money owed to Energia.

6.6 In the event that any part of an Invoice remains unpaid where the part that remains unpaid is not due to a legitimate dispute as set out in Energia’s Code of Practice on Billing Energia may disconnect the supply of Energy to the Premises, in accordance with Energia’s Code of Practice on Disconnection, and may proceed in any manner for recovery of the amount due.

6.7 In the case of Dual Fuel Customers, Energia will issue two separate Invoices, one in respect of gas and one in respect of electricity.  In the event that you make a part-payment of an Invoice, the part that has been paid will be applied against that Invoice relating to the relevant fuel consumed.  In the event that it is not possible for Energia to determine which fuel payment has been made in respect of, Energia will apply the payment received towards discharging the Invoice with the older debt. In the event of non-payment, Energia will only disconnect the fuel against which the debt is unpaid. The Product Terms Sheet will contain supplementary conditions for Dual Fuel Customers.

6.8 Energia may charge (i) interest on overdue invoices on a daily basis from the due date until the date of payment at a default rate that is 3% per annum above EURIBOR; (ii) reasonable costs of trying to recover overdue payments. Energia may also charge you for the costs of collecting late payments, which may include cost associated with:

(a) Energia visiting the Premises;

(b) your bank rejecting a direct debit, because there is not sufficient money in your bank account or returns a cheque to Energia unpaid; or

(c)  Any third party costs incurred by Energia in recovering or collecting the late payment.

In addition, if any amount due is not paid by the due date, Energia shall be entitled to draw down the amount due under the Security.

6.9 Some Tariffs are calculated based on estimated consumption over a 12 month (or shorter) period. If you pay an equal amount each month for your Energy by direct debit or by any other payment method agreed by Energia (as appropriate), we may change the monthly amount payable by you and/or the number of months for which you will pay the equal amount following (for example) a review of your actual Energy usage or change in the Charges. You will be liable for any costs associated with this following recalculation of your bills or statements.

#### 

7\. Security

7.1 Energia may request a security deposit from you in advance of the provision of the Energy supply. The decision to request a security deposit is taken on an account by account basis and can be influenced by security requirements and credit history of the Customer. The value and duration of the security requirement is based on all information available to Energia at the time of the decision. Security deposits may be applied to new and existing customers and, during the term of supply, Energia may increase an existing security deposit or request a new security deposit from you if:

(a) you don’t meet Energia’s credit criteria;

(b) you fail to pay or are late in paying any amount due to us (including the security deposit); or

(c) as a result of your conduct.

7.2  In the event that Energia’s security requirements are not met, your Energy supply may be disconnected. Any costs reasonably incurred by Energia may be recovered from you and you shall pay the cost of disconnection and of subsequent reconnection (if any), provided that Energia has complied with our Code of Practice on Disconnection in connection with disconnection.

7.3  In addition to any rights Energia may have under this Agreement, any security deposit held may be used to offset any unpaid monies due to us.

7.4  If you close your account with Energia while Energia holds a security deposit from you then the amount of the security deposit will be used to offset your final Invoice.

7.5  Energia shall return the balance of any security deposit to you:

(a) within 1 month upon the closure of your account; or

(b) after one year if you have met Energia’s credit terms for this period,

In either case by cheque if you have provided Energia with a forwarding address or by bank transfer if Energia holds your bank details.

7.6  In the event that Energia’s credit terms are not met after one year Energia will continue to hold the security deposit in respect of your account.  In this instance, Energia will inform you of the steps which must be taken to satisfy Energia’s credit terms so that the security deposit will no longer be required. The security deposit will thereafter be kept until such time as Energia’s credit terms have been met for a continuous 12 month period, and the security deposit will be returned to you in the month following a determination by Energia that the credit terms have been met.

#### 

8\. Change Of Supplier

8.1 You will not be charged for changing supplier.

8.2 If you switch to another supplier, your account with Energia will be closed only when the new supplier starts to supply you. You must pay, in full, the outstanding balance on your account at this time. The total outstanding balance will include all charges associated with the supply of energy and any other charges deemed by Energia to reasonably apply to your account; such charges may from time to time include an early termination fee for termination in advance of the agreed contract end date.

8.3 If you are a Dual Fuel Customer and you move your electricity supply to another supplier but Energia continue to supply you with gas, Energia will charge you the gas only Tariff that Energia considers is most appropriate (which may be different to the dual fuel gas Tariff) from the date that your electricity supply has moved to that other electricity supplier. This will apply to customers on Fixed Tariffs, Hybrid Tariffs and Variable Tariffs. An exit fee may be charged in respect of the electricity supply being cancelled.

8.4 If you are a Dual Fuel Customer and you move your gas supply to another supplier but Energia continues to supply you with electricity, Energia will charge you the electricity only Tariff that Energia considers is most appropriate (which may be different to the dual fuel Tariff) from the date that your gas supply has moved to that other gas supplier. This will apply to customers on Fixed Tariffs, Hybrid Tariffs and Variable Tariffs.  If you are a Dual Fuel Smart Customer and you move your gas supply to another supplier, this will not invalidate your Agreement and your half hourly interval consumption data will continue to be supplied to Energia.  An exit fee may be charged in respect of the gas supply being cancelled.

8.5  If you do not meet the credit terms set by Energia and you attempt to change supplier, a debt flag will be displayed on your account and be visible to the proposed new supplier.

8.6  If you are a Pay As You Go Customer and you decide to move your electricity supply to another supplier, you will need to notify Energia in accordance with Clause 13. In addition, you will need to contact our call centre directly to request a deactivation code and to claim any refund that may be due to you.  Energia shall issue the deactivation code no later than 10 days of the receipt of the MM110 (change of supply) market message. The deactivation code may be issued to you over the phone from a call centre representative, or may be emailed to you.  Please see the Code of Practice on Pay as You Go Metering and Budget Controllers for more information, available on [Energia’s website.](https://www.energia.ie/home)
