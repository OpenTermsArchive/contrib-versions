Tos The gist

We (the folks at E14N) run a service called Identi.ca and would love for you to use it. Our service is designed to give you as much control and ownership over what goes in your notice stream as possible and encourage you to express yourself freely. However, be responsible in what you post. In particular, make sure that none of the prohibited items listed below appear in your notice stream or get linked to from your notice stream (things like spam, viruses, or hate content).

You can review our Public Stream to get a sense of the types of notices that are welcome on our service (or not!). If you find a Identi.ca account that you believe violates our terms of service, please check our Contact documentation.

(Note: Automattic, Inc., original creators of the below Terms of Service, decided to make them available under a Creative Commons Sharealike license, which means you’re more than welcome to steal it and repurpose it for your own use. Just make sure to replace references to us with ones to you. They’d appreciate a link to WordPress.com somewhere on your site. They spent a lot of money and time on the below, and other people shouldn’t need to do the same. (We didn't!))
