Additional Terms of Service
===========================

Thank you for using Google Voice! By using Google Voice (the 'Service'), you accept and agree to be bound by the [Google Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms), the [Google Voice Acceptable Use Policy](https://support.google.com/voice/answer/9230450) and the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy), as well as these additional terms and conditions (collectively the 'Terms of Service'). It's important for you to read each of these documents, as they form a legal agreement between you and Google regarding your use of the Service.

### Caller ID

If you have a Google Voice number, it will appear on the recipient's caller ID. If you haven't set up a Google Voice number, a generic number or the word 'unknown' will appear to the person you're calling.

### Emergency calls

You understand and agree that Google Voice is an enhanced call management application and that Google Voice isn't capable of placing or receiving emergency service calls. In addition, if you haven't set up a Google Voice number but you're using Google Voice to call a public-safety answering point (PSAP), then the PSAPÂ  see a generic number or the word 'unknown' on your caller ID and might not be able to call you back.

### Google's proprietary rights

Google has the right not to provide calling or connections to any telephone numbers, at its sole discretion. Unserved numbers may include, but are not limited to certain geographical locations, special service numbers, satellite telephony services and other call-forwarding services.

### Recording conversations

Google Voice provides a function that allows you to record individual telephone conversations.

### Bill payment

Depending on the Google Voice service that you sign up to, you may be required to pay fees in connection with the Services, as stated by Google. There may be additional fees if you request a change in any Services. Depending on the level of Service selected by you, there may be charges for calls to or from certain locations, including, without limitation, payphones and areas within extended calling zones. There may also be applicable charges for any special or enhanced services that you use.
