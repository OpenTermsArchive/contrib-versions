Stack Exchange Network Acceptable Use Policy
--------------------------------------------

The intent of this Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”) is to clarify what we at Stack Exchange, Inc. (“Stack Exchange”, “we” or “us”) consider to be acceptable use of any website or service provided on Stack Exchange’s set of related Internet sites and other applications for contributed and curated content (the “Network”).

If you are found to be in violation of any of the below sections, your access to the Network may be restricted or terminated without notice, and your content may be removed at our discretion. When it is possible to do so, Stack Exchange will make a good-faith effort to provide you with advance notice of actions we take under this AUP, and we will do our best to work with you and ensure a fair outcome in all cases. You may appeal any action we take under this AUP via our [contact form.](https://stackoverflow.com/contact)

Illegal Use

The Network may not be used for illegal purposes. You are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations that are applicable to you, whether or not such illegal purposes are explicitly raised in this AUP or our [Code of Conduct.](https://stackoverflow.com/conduct) This restriction encompasses any defamation and libel laws that apply to you.

Spam

You may not post content for the purpose of affiliated marketing (e.g., to promote a product, service, or similar in a way that is unsolicited or lacks disclosure of affiliation), or use deceptive means to generate revenue or traffic. Posting irrelevant content, non-meaningful content, or other types of content that may reasonably be interpreted as spam per individual site policies, is also prohibited.

Phishing

You may not use the service in any way that deceives users into disclosing sensitive information they would otherwise not disclose, such as passwords, API keys, or personally identifiable information.

Doxing

Disclosing personally identifiable information of a person or group of people, that hasn’t been manifestly made public, without their explicit consent is not allowed, whether or not that information is accurate. This includes such information as financial information, government-issued identification, passwords, phone numbers, physical addresses, and other personal information that may pose a safety or security risk, including usernames and e-mail addresses.

Malicious URLs

You may not post URLs that were created for the purpose of promoting a scam, attack, or fraud.

Identity Theft

You may not falsely represent yourself as a real person or entity you are not.

Disruptions and Exploits

You may not attempt to exploit, overload, or otherwise disrupt the operations of the Network.

Unauthorized Use of Intellectual Property

You may not post content that infringes on another’s intellectual property right, including trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret, or other intellectual property right. While the use of copyrighted material does not constitute copyright infringement in all cases, users should be careful when using copyrighted content without the permission of those who created it and adhere to any license requirements (e.g., attribution, notice, etc.). Stack Exchange complies with the [Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA")](https://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf), and you may view [our process for reporting DMCA complaints.](https://policies.stackoverflow.co/company/dmca-takedown)

Mass Registration and Automation

You may not register accounts en masse, either by hand or through the use of automated tools, without prior written approval of Stack Exchange, Inc. Please contact [\[email protected\]](https://stackoverflow.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) to request approval.

Sexually Explicit Material

You may not post content, or links to content, that is sexually explicit in nature, unless it falls within a reasonable interpretation of a Network site’s scope and purpose. However, you may never post content portraying the sexual exploitation or abuse of minors. For the sake of clarity, sexually explicit content is “material that is explicitly sexual, pornographic, prurient, or lascivious in nature,” as defined in our [Code of Conduct.](https://stackoverflow.com/conduct)

Framing and Mirroring

You may not manipulate or otherwise simulate the appearance or function of the Network by using framing, mirroring, or similar other methods, such as by creating deep links to the Network or directly framing our site on another domain. This restriction does not apply for accessibility-related usages such as screen readers. Please contact [\[email protected\]](https://stackoverflow.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) with any inquiries.

Content Scraping

You may not use any automated data-gathering means (including robots, spiders, scrapers, crawlers, and the like) to gather any text, files, audio or visual media, profile information, or any other content from any Network website for any use that violates the [Public Network Terms of Service,](https://stackoverflow.com/legal/terms-of-service/public) including the content license, or this Acceptable Use Policy.

Your usage of automated data-gathering means is exempt from this policy if either:

1. Such automated data-gathering is necessary for accessibility-related reasons.
2. You have obtained our express written prior consent. (You may contact [\[email protected\]](https://stackoverflow.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) with any inquiries.)
