Stack Exchange Network Acceptable Use Policy
--------------------------------------------

The intent of this Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”) is to clarify what we at Stack Exchange, Inc. (“Stack Exchange”, “we” or “us”) consider to be acceptable use of any website or service provided on the Stack Exchange Network.

If you are found to be in violation of any of the below policies, your account may be suspended or terminated, and we may otherwise block your access by other means. We will do our best to work with you and ensure a fair outcome in all cases. We reserve the right to immediately suspend or terminate, without notice, any content, account, or IP address which we determine to be in violation of this AUP. Please note that while we will make best efforts to provide you with notice, in the event that infringing activities are suspected, we may take certain preemptive actions in an effort to protect our systems and other users. You may request an appeal via our [contact form](https://stackoverflow.com/contact).

If your account is suspended, public access to content contributed under that account may be blocked or removed, and your account may be further suspended or deleted at our discretion. Access to other functionality or information within the Stack Exchange Network may also be blocked or disabled.

Illegal Use

The Stack Exchange Network may not be used for illegal purposes. You are responsible for complying with all applicable laws and regulations, whether or not such illegal purposes are explicitly raised in this AUP or our [Code of Conduct](https://stackoverflow.com/conduct).

Spam

Adding content (or adjusting existing content) whose primary purpose is affiliated marketing (e.g., to promote a product, service, or similar in a way that is unsolicited or lacks disclosure of affiliation) or using deceptive means to generate revenue or traffic.

Phishing

Posting malicious content, or social engineering conduct to fool people into giving information they would otherwise not, such as passwords, API keys, or personally identifiable information.

Doxing

Disclosure of personally identifiable information of a person or group of people, whether or not that information is accurate.

Malicious URLs

Posting a link created with the purpose of promoting a scam, attack, or fraud.

Identity Theft and Violating Privacy

Appropriating the identity of another person or entity. Users may not post other people's personally identifying or confidential information, including but not limited to financial information (e.g., credit card numbers, account numbers, etc.), government issued identifiers (e.g., Social Security Numbers, driver's license number, and other identification numbers), passwords, usernames, phone numbers, physical addresses, and e-mail addresses unless already publicly accessible on the Web.

Unlawful Speech

Hate speech and other objectionable content that is unlawful (libelous, defamatory, fraudulent, etc.). Note that an allegation of defamatory expression, in and of itself, does not establish defamation. The truth or falsehood of a bit of expression is a key element in establishing defamation, and we are not in a position to make that sort of fact-based judgment. That said, if we have reason to believe that a particular statement is defamatory (a court order, for example), we will remove that statement.

Disruptions and Exploits

Attempted or unauthorized use of the Stack Exchange Network.

Unauthorized Use of Intellectual Property

Posting content that infringes on another’s intellectual property right, including trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret, or other intellectual property right. Note that using copyrighted material does not constitute infringement in all cases. In general, however, users should be careful when using copyrighted content without the permission of those who created it and adhere to any license requirements (e.g., attribution, notice, etc.). It is our [policy](https://policies.stackoverflow.co/company/dmca-takedown) to respond to notices of alleged intellectual property infringement sent to [\[email protected\]](https://stackoverflow.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) (e.g., the [Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA")](http://www.loc.gov/copyright/legislation/dmca.pdf)).

Mass Registration and Automation

Accounts that are registered automatically or systematically.

Sexually Explicit Material

Posting of content or posting links to content that is sexually explicit or contains pornographic material, including the sexual exploitation or abuse of minors.

Framing and Scraping

Frame or mirror any Stack Exchange Network website without Stack Exchange's express prior consent. Use any automated or non-automated data gathering means (including but not limited to robots, spiders, scrapers, crawlers, and the like) to gather any text, files, audio or visual media, profile information, or any other content from any Stack Exchange Network website without Stack Exchange's express prior consent.
