Updated 23 January 2023

Please read this cookie policy carefully as it contains important information on who we are and how we use cookies on our website.

Who we are?

This website is operated by the Stack Exchange Network (also referred to herein as “Stack Overflow”, “Stack Exchange”, or “Network”). Stack Overflow is a set of related Internet sites and other applications for questions and answers, owned and operated by Stack Exchange, Inc. (“Stack Overflow”, “we” or “us”), a Delaware corporation.

These other third party websites may also use cookies or similar technologies in accordance with their own separate policies. For privacy information relating to these other third party websites, please consult their policies as appropriate.

Cookies

A cookie is a small text file that our sites store on your computer or mobile device when you visit our websites. Our websites, apps and other services (“Sites”), send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer or other device so the website or app can access, store or collect information from your device when you first request a web page. Browsers support cookies and similar technologies (such as local storage and pixels) so that our websites can remember information about your visit and can use the information to improve your experience and to create aggregated anonymized statistics about usage of the site. In this Policy, we use the term “cookie” to refer both to cookies and similar technologies.

Cookies may be set by the site you are visiting (“first-party cookies”) or by a third party, such as those who provide analytics or advertising services or interactive content on the site (“third-party cookies”). In addition to using cookies on our sites, we may also serve our cookies (specifically, our advertising pixel) on third-party sites operated by our advertisers who use our advertising platform.

If you use the Stack Overflow Network, both Stack Overflow and third parties will use cookies to track and monitor some of your activities on and off the Stack Overflow Network, and store and access some data about you, your browsing history, and your usage of the Stack Overflow Network.

Third Party Cookies

Our third party partners and other organizations that sponsor pages on Stack Overflow may use cookies or other technologies to learn more about your interest in their products and services and in some cases to tailor such products and services to you.

Third-Party Cookies: Our services also include cookies from third parties that we partner with or which provide services us. These include third party companies that work with us or with advertisers who advertise on the Stack Exchange Network in order to help target ads or measure the results of an advertising campaign.

For further information on cookies generally, including how to control and manage them, visit the guidance on cookies published by the UK Information Commissioner’s Office, [https://www.aboutcookies.org](https://www.aboutcookies.org/) or [https://www.allaboutcookies.org](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/).
