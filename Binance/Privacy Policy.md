### 5\. Does Binance Share My Personal Information?

Information about our users is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of selling our users' personal information to others.   Binance shares users' personal information only as described below and with the subsidiaries or affiliates of Binance that are either subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.

Third party service providers: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.  Examples include analysing data, providing marketing assistance, processing payments, transmitting content, and assessing and managing credit risk.  These third-party service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as only permitted by applicable data protection laws.

Business transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such transactions, user information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the user consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Binance or substantially all of its assets are acquired, user information will be one of the transferred assets.

Protection of Binance and others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law or with our regulatory obligations; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of Binance, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

### 6\. International transfers of personal data

Binance may transfer your data outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Binance puts in place suitable safeguards to ensure that such transfer is carried out in compliance with applicable data protection rules, except where the country to which the data is transferred has already been determined by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of protection.

Where Binance transfers personal data to affiliates or service providers, Binance relies on the standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission.

### 7\. How Secure is My Information?

We design our systems with your security and privacy in mind.  We work to protect the security of your personal information during transmission by using encryption protocols and software.

We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of your personal information. Our security procedures mean that we may ask you to verify your identity before we disclose personal information to you.

It is important for you to protect against unauthorised access to your account password. We recommend using a unique password for your Binance account that is not utilized for other online accounts. Be sure to sign off when you finish using a shared computer.

### 8\. What About Advertising?

We may share your personal information with our marketing partners for the purposes of targeting, modeling, and/or analytics as well as marketing and advertising.

### 9\. What Information Can I Access?

You can access your information, including your name, address, payment options, profile information, and transaction history in the "Your Account" section of the website.

### 10\. What Choices Do I Have?

If you have any questions or objection as to how we collect and process your personal information, please contact dpo@binance.com.

When you consent to our processing your personal information for a specified purpose, you may withdraw your consent at any time and we will stop any further processing of your data for that purpose.

In addition, subject to applicable law, you have the right to request access to, correct, and delete your personal data, and to ask for data portability. You may also object to our processing of your personal data or ask that we restrict the processing of your personal data in certain instances. If you wish to do any of these things, please contact dpo@binance.com.

### 11\. How Long Does Binance Keep My Personal Information?

### 12\. EU GDPR and UK Data Protection Laws - Legal Basis

The EU GDPR and UK data protection laws require a legal basis for our use of personal information. Our basis varies depending on the specific purpose for which we use personal information. We rely on:

*   Performance of a contract when we provide you with products or services, or communicate with you about them. This includes when we use your personal information to take and handle orders, and process payments.
    
*   Our legitimate business interests and the interests of our users when we detect and prevent fraud and abuse in order to protect the security of our users, ourselves, or others.
    
*   Your consent when we ask for your consent to process your personal information for a specific purpose that we communicate to you. When you consent to our processing your personal information for a specified purpose, you may withdraw your consent at any time and we will stop processing of your data for that purpose.
    
*   Compliance with a legal obligation when we use your personal information to comply with laws. For instance, we collect bank account information for identity verification purposes.
