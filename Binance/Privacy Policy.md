Binance (“Binance”, “we”, or “us”) is committed to protecting the privacy of our customers, and we take our data protection responsibilities with the utmost seriousness.

This Privacy Notice describes how Binance collects and processes your personal information through the Binance websites and applications that reference this Privacy Notice. Binance refers to an ecosystem comprising Binance websites (whose domain names include but are not limited to [www.binance.com/en](https://www.binance.com/en)), mobile applications, clients, applets and other applications that are developed to offer Binance Services, and includes independently-operated platforms, websites and clients within the ecosystem (e.g., Binance’s Open Platform, Binance Launchpad, Binance Labs, Binance Charity, Binance DEX, Binance X, JEX, and fiat gateways). “Binance Operators” refer to all parties that run Binance, including but not limited to legal persons, unincorporated organizations and teams that provide Binance Services and are responsible for such services. “Binance” as used in this Privacy Notice includes Binance Operators.

This Privacy Notice applies to all Personal Information processing activities carried out by us, across platforms, websites, and departments of Binance and Binance Operators.

To the extent that you are a customer or user of our services, this Privacy Notice applies together with any terms of business and other contractual documents, including but not limited to any agreements we may have with you.

To the extent that you are not a relevant stakeholder, customer or user of our services, but are using our website, this Privacy Notice also applies to you together with our Cookie Notice.

This Notice should therefore be read together with our Cookie Notice, which provides further details on our use of cookies on the website. Our Cookie Notice can be accessed [here](https://www.binance.com/en/cookie-policy).

However, depending on your place of legal residence certain other Binance entities could be involved in processing activities such as Know Your Customer (“KYC”) activities which are necessary for us to provide Services to you.

### 5\. Does Binance Share My Personal Information?

We may share your Personal Data with third parties (including other Binance entities) if we believe that sharing your Personal Data is in accordance with, or required by, any contractual relationship with you or us, applicable law, regulation or legal process. When sharing your Personal Information with other Binance entities, we will use our best endeavours to ensure that such entity is either subject to this Privacy Notice, or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice. For example, if you are resident in France, Binance France SAS, is responsible for running KYC checks.

We may also share personal information with the following persons:

* **Third party service providers:** We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include analysing data, providing marketing assistance, processing payments, transmitting content, and assessing and managing credit risk. These third-party service providers only have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in accordance with our contractual agreements and only as permitted by applicable data protection laws.
    
* **Legal Authorities:** We may be required by law or by Court to disclose certain information about you or any engagement we may have with you to relevant regulatory, law enforcement and/or other competent authorities. We will disclose information about you to legal authorities to the extent we are obliged to do so according to the law. We may also need to share your information in order to enforce or apply our legal rights or to prevent fraud.
    
* **Business transfers:** As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such transactions, user information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the user consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Binance or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, user information will be one of the transferred assets.
    
* **Protection of Binance and others:** We release accounts and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law or with our regulatory obligations; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of Binance, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
    

### 6\. International transfers of Personal Information

To facilitate our global operations, Binance may transfer your personal information outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), UK and Switzerland. The EEA includes the European Union countries as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. Transfers outside of the EEA are sometimes referred to as “third country transfers”.

We may transfer your personal data within our Affiliates, third-party partners, and service providers based throughout the world. In cases where we intend to transfer personal data to third countries or international organisations outside of the EEA. Binance puts in place suitable technical, organizational and contractual safeguards (including Standard Contractual Clauses), to ensure that such transfer is carried out in compliance with applicable data protection rules, except where the country to which the personal information is transferred has already been determined by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of protection.

We also rely on decisions from the European Commission where they recognise that certain countries and territories outside of the European Economic Area ensure an adequate level of protection for personal information. These decisions are referred to as “adequacy decisions”. We transfer personal data to Japan on the basis of the Japanese Adequacy Decision.

### 7\. How Secure is My Information?

We design our systems with your security and privacy in mind. We have appropriate security measures in place to prevent your information being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. We work to protect the security of your personal information during transmission and while stored by using encryption protocols and softwares. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of your personal information. In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know.

Our security procedures mean that we may ask you to verify your identity to protect you against unauthorised access to your account password. We recommend using a unique password for your Binance account that is not utilized for other online accounts and to sign off when you finish using a shared computer.

### 8\. What About Advertising?

In order for us to provide you with the best user experience, we may share your personal information with our marketing partners for the purposes of targeting, modelling, and/or analytics as well as marketing and advertising. You have a right to object at any time to processing of your personal information for direct marketing purposes (see Section 9 below).

* **Right to portability**: in some cases, you can ask to receive your personal information which you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, or, when this is possible, that we communicate your personal information on your behalf directly to another data controller;
    
* **Right to withdraw your consent**: for processing requiring your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Exercising this right does not affect the lawfulness of the processing based on the consent given before the withdrawal of the latter;
    
* **Right to lodge a complaint with the relevant data protection authority**: We hope that we can satisfy any queries you may have about the way in which we process your personal information. However, if you have unresolved concerns, you also have the right to complain to the Irish Data Protection Commission or the data protection authority in the location in which you live, work or believe a data protection breach has occurred.
