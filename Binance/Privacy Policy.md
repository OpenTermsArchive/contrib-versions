5.  **Automated Decisions, Profiling and our use of Artificial Intelligence**
    

We also conduct automated decision-making, including profiling. An automated decision can be made based on an assessment carried out automatically using technology. In some cases, these may involve evaluating behaviour or making predictions about you, which are relevant to the service you require ("Profiling"). You have a right to object to decisions involving the use of your personal data, which have been taken solely by automated means. See Section 12 below, "Right to contest to a decision based solely on automated processing".

Additionally, we use artificial intelligence ("AI") technology to extract important data in order to ensure the accuracy of information, check for inconsistencies, detect potential errors, missing information and data mismatches.  The processing activities carried out using AI technology should not have any significant impact on you.  

6.  **Can Children Use Binance Services?**
    

Binance provides Binance Junior to minors, which is a way for those aged between 6 and the age of majority in their jurisdiction (which is 18 in most jurisdictions but can be up to 21) to learn about cryptocurrencies and safely use the platform with the help of their parents or legal guardians, by enabling a parent or legal guardian to set up a sub-account of their own Binance account for their minor. Binance Junior aims to provide a safe and educational environment for those aged 6 and above to learn about crypto and blockchain technology. See the [Binance Junior Privacy Notice](https://www.binance.com/en/about-legal/privacynotice-binance-junior) for more information about how Binance processes personal data in the context of Binance Junior, but this Privacy Notice should always be referred to for full details of our processing of Personal Data across our services.

Other than Binance Junior, Binance does not allow anyone under the age of 18 to use Binance Services and nor do we knowingly request or collect any information about persons under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, please do not provide any personal data to Binance Services  (other than in the context of Binance Junior).

If a User or Customer submitting personal data (other than for Binance Junior) is suspected of being younger than 18 years of age, Binance will require the relevant Customer or User to close their account and will take steps to delete the individual’s information as soon as possible.    

In compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulatory requirements, we will retain Date of Birth (DOB) information when an individual who is under the legal age attempts to complete the Know Your Customer (KYC) identity verification process. This retention is necessary to prevent repeated attempts to re-register while an individual is under the legal age and to protect the integrity and security of our services by prohibiting underage access to our platform.

7.  **What About Cookies and Other Identifiers?**
    

We use cookies and similar tools to enhance your user experience, provide our services, enhance our marketing efforts and understand how customers use our services so we can make improvements. Depending on applicable laws in the region you are located in, the cookie banner on your browser will tell you how to accept or refuse cookies. A copy of our Cookie Notice is available [here](https://www.binance.com/en/cookie-privacy).    

8.  **How and Why, We Share Your Personal Data?**
    

We may share your personal data with third parties (including other Binance entities) if we believe that sharing your personal data is in accordance with, or required by, any contractual relationship with you (including Binance Terms & Conditions) or us, applicable law, regulation or legal process. When sharing your personal data with other Binance entities, we will use our best endeavours to ensure that such entities are either subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice. For example, depending on where you reside and the entity responsible for running KYC checks. For more information, please refer to Section 2 "The Binance entity Responsible for looking after your Personal Data".

We may also share personal data with the following persons or in the following circumstances:

Further, they must process the personal data in accordance with our contractual agreements and only as permitted by applicable data protection laws. 
    
2.  In accordance with and as far as provided by applicable law, your personal data may also be shared by third parties (i.e. _another data controller_) upon exercising your right to data portability. Please refer to Section 12 "What Rights Do I Have?", for more information on data portability.

Please note that when you use third-party services or Binance affiliate services which are not governed by this Privacy Notice, their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those services and products.
    

*   _Third Party Independent Controllers_: Within the context of the services rendered by Binance, some of the third-party service providers and/or counterparties to the transactions may process your personal data as independent data controllers for their own purposes which may include but are not limited to:
    

1.  compliance with legal or regulatory obligations under applicable laws;

In such transactions, user information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the user consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Binance or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, user information will be one of the transferred assets.

9.  **International transfers of Personal Data**
    

To facilitate our global operations, Binance may transfer your personal data to countries outside of your country of residence, including but not limited to jurisdictions outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and Switzerland. The EEA includes the European Union countries as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. Transfers outside of the EEA and/or your country of residence are sometimes referred to as “third country transfers”. These transfers may be made to countries that relevant authorities, such as the European Commission, have recognised as providing adequate data privacy safeguards and to some countries that are not subject to an adequacy decision (which includes participants under the EU Data Privacy Framework). 

We may transfer your personal data to our Affiliates, third-party partners, and service providers based throughout the world. In cases where we intend to transfer personal data to third countries or international organisations outside of your country of residence that are not subject to an adequacy decision and further safeguards are required, Binance puts in place suitable technical, organizational and contractual safeguards (including Standard Contractual Clauses), to ensure that such transfer is carried out in compliance with applicable data protection rules.

Personal data of Mandarin or Chinese speaking users may be accessed by Customer Support located in China, where the relevant users seek local language support. Any remote access from China to user data is carried out in accordance with necessary safeguards which ensure an adequate level of protection for personal data.

You have a right to obtain more information about the safeguards we have put in place to ensure the adequate protection of your personal data when this is transferred as mentioned above. To exercise this right, please contact us [here](mailto:dpo@binance.com). 

10.  **How We Secure Personal Data?**
     

We design our systems with your security and privacy in mind. We have appropriate security measures in place to prevent your information being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. We work to protect the security of your personal data during transmission and while stored by using encryption protocols and softwares. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of your personal data. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know.

If you detect or suspect that your device has been compromised by malware or suspicious software, we may request additional information to help secure your account and to protect the Binance platform. This may include screenshots you voluntarily share to assist us in identifying unauthorised access or suspicious activity, and malware-related data, such as the cryptographic hash of identified malware and links to suspicious files, to help investigate threats. Any data shared for these purposes will be used for security investigation and fraud prevention in accordance with our legal obligations and legitimate interest in maintaining platform integrity. We will handle this information security and limit access to authorised security and IT teams only.

Our security procedures mean that we may ask you to verify your identity to protect you against unauthorised access to your account. We recommend using a unique password for your Binance account that is not utilized for other online accounts and to sign off when you finish using a shared computer.
