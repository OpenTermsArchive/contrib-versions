The service providers rely on legal bases for data processing as disclosed in their respective privacy notices, accessible from their websites. Your personal data will be processed no longer than necessary for the above processing purposes and will be retained according to the service providers’ retention schedules. You can request for more information about the identity of the third party service providers and their processing activities by contacting Binance (see Section 10). 

*   Legal Authorities or Legal requirements: We may share your information with courts, law enforcement authorities, regulators, attorneys or other third parties: (a) to comply with laws and legal obligations; (b) for the establishment, exercise, or defence of a legal or equitable claim; (c) to respond to law enforcement and regulatory requests, including (1) when we are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order, search or seizure warrant, or similar legal procedure, or (2) for international law enforcement requests, pursuant to a mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT) or letters of request; (d) to comply with one or more forms of “travel rules” that require our transmitting of your information to another financial institution, regulatory authorities or other industry partners; (e) when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of personal information is necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of our customers, Binance, or others, including to prevent imminent physical harm or material financial loss; (f) to investigate violations of our Terms of Use or other applicable policies; or (g) to detect, investigate, prevent or address fraud or credit risk, other illegal activity or security and technical issues, to report suspected illegal activity or to assist law enforcement in the investigation of suspected illegal or wrongful activity.
    
*   Business transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such transactions, user information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the user consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Binance or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, user information will be one of the transferred assets.
    
*   With your Consent: We also may disclose your Personal Data as may be described in a notice to you at the time the information is collected or before it is shared, or in any other manner to which you consent.
    

7\. International transfers of Personal Information

To facilitate our global operations, Binance may transfer your personal information outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), UK and Switzerland. The EEA includes the European Union countries as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. Transfers outside of the EEA are sometimes referred to as “third country transfers”.

We may transfer your personal information to our Affiliates, third-party partners, and service providers based throughout the world. In cases where we intend to transfer personal information to third countries or international organisations outside of the EEA, Binance puts in place suitable technical, organizational and contractual safeguards (including Standard Contractual Clauses), to ensure that such transfer is carried out in compliance with applicable data protection rules.

We also rely on decisions from the European Commission where they recognise that certain countries and territories outside of the European Economic Area ensure an adequate level of protection for personal information. These decisions are referred to as “adequacy decisions”.

8\. How Secure is My Information?

We design our systems with your security and privacy in mind. We have appropriate security measures in place to prevent your information being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. We work to protect the security of your personal data during transmission and while stored by using encryption protocols and softwares. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of your personal data. In addition, we limit access to your personal data  to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know.

Our security procedures mean that we may ask you to verify your identity to protect you against unauthorised access to your account. We recommend using a unique password for your Binance account that is not utilized for other online accounts and to sign off when you finish using a shared computer.
