The use of the Platform and other access methods may be subject to such additional terms as we communicate to you.

10.1. **Your Account History**. You will be able to access your Account History on the Platform. You must review your Account History carefully and let us know if you see any entries or Transactions that you do not recognise or you think are incorrect within fourteen (14) calendar days of the date that your Account History is provided or made available to you. 

10.2. **Errors**. We may rectify any error in your Account History at any time, and reserve the right to void or reverse any Transaction involving or deriving from a Manifest Error or to amend the details of such Transaction to reflect what we reasonably consider to be the correct or fair details of such a Transaction absent Manifest Error. Without prejudice to the generality of the other terms in these Terms, and in the absence of fraud or bad faith, Binance shall in no circumstances be liable to you for any loss or demand of whatsoever nature you may suffer or incur in connection with any Manifest Error howsoever arising, whether direct or indirect, special or consequential, including, but not limited to, loss of profit or loss of opportunity, even if Binance had been advised of the possibility of the same arising or that the same were reasonably foreseeable.

You acknowledge and agree that we are entitled to disclose such information. For more information about how we process your personal data you can review our [Privacy Notice](https://web.archive.org/web/20240515111941/https://www.binance.com/en-GB/privacy). 

**USING YOUR ACCOUNT**

**11\. Instructions**

11.1. **Giving Instructions**. You must ensure that any Instruction submitted is complete and accurate. We are not required to verify the accuracy, authenticity or validity of any Instruction and will not monitor or reject Instructions on the basis that they are, or appear to be, duplicates. However, if we are in doubt as to the accuracy, authenticity or validity of an Instruction, we may refuse to act upon or defer acting upon any Instruction, or seek further information with respect to the Instruction.

Instructions are irrevocable and therefore once an Instruction has been submitted you, or your Permitted Users, have no right to rescind or withdraw it without our written consent. Your Instruction is not deemed to be received by us until it has been received by our server. Our record of all Instructions will be conclusive and binding on you for all purposes.

11.2. **Acting on your Instructions**. By submitting an Instruction you or your Permitted Users are authorising us to initiate the Transaction on your Binance Account. We are therefore authorised to credit or debit (or provide settlement information to third parties for the purposes of the third party crediting or debiting) your Digital Assets from your Binance Account in accordance with your Instruction. If you have insufficient Digital Assets or Fiat Currency in your Binance Account to effect the Transaction (i.e. less than the required amount to settle the Transaction and to pay all the fees associated with the Transaction), then we have the right to refuse to effect any Transaction. It is your responsibility to hold sufficient Digital Assets or Fiat Currency credited in your Binance Account.

11.3. **Protection of Instructions**. You are aware that Instructions and information transmitted on the Platform or by email are generally transmitted via the internet and may be routed via public, transnational installations which are not specifically protected. We cannot guarantee that the Instructions and information transmitted will be completely protected against unauthorised access, and you accept the associated risks.

11.4. **Withdrawals**. Subject to these Terms and any applicable Product Terms, and provided that you have sufficient balance on your Binance Account and the relevant Digital Assets are not on hold in your Binance Account in connection with any Binance Service, you may give Instructions to Binance to transfer Digital Assets to an external wallet address by submitting a withdrawal request on the Platform. Upon receipt of the withdrawal request, Binance will: (i) deduct your Binance Account balance; and (ii) initiate an on-chain transfer to an external wallet designated by you. Binance may not process a withdrawal request if, in our reasonable opinion, we consider that Applicable Law prevents the execution of the relevant withdrawal. Binance may also suspend withdrawals at such time deemed appropriate by Binance to resolve any incidents on the Platform. Once such incidents have been resolved, Binance will resume withdrawals.

**12\. Transactions**

12.1. **Entering into Transactions**. You may enter into Transactions directly with us, or directly with other users, which may or may not be facilitated by us. 

We do not represent or warrant that any Transaction will be completed successfully or within a specific time period. 

12.2. **Unauthorised Transactions**. You are responsible for the control and use of your Binance Account. As such, we will assume that you, or a Permitted User, have authorised any Instruction sent from your Binance Account unless we are notified otherwise. It is important that you monitor your Account History to ensure any unauthorised or suspicious activity on your Binance Account is identified and notified to us as soon as possible. We are not responsible for any claim or losses resulting from a Transaction executed as a result of an unauthorised Instruction unless you have notified us in accordance with this clause.

12.3. **Retention of Transaction information**. To facilitate compliance with global industry standards for data retention, you agree to permit us (but agree to not require us) to keep a record of all Transaction information for the lifetime of your Binance Account as long as it is required to fulfil their intended purposes, or such other period as prescribed by Applicable Law. Please review our [Privacy Notice](https://web.archive.org/web/20240515111941/https://www.binance.com/en-GB/privacy) for more information on how we collect and use data relating to the use and performance of our Sites and the Binance Services.

In particular, we and any Binance Affiliate may from time to time act in more than one capacity, and in those capacities we may receive fees or commissions from more than one user (including you). You agree that we may act in such capacities and provide any other Binance Services or carry out any business with or for you, any Binance Affiliate or any other user.

13.3. **Material interests**. You understand and agree that neither we nor any Binance Affiliate will be required to: (1) have regard to any information known to us, or to any Binance Affiliate, which is a material interest; (2) disclose any such information to you; or (3) use any such information for your benefit. You further acknowledge that from time to time we may receive general market information in the course of providing Binance Services to you, which we may use in the ordinary course of our business.

13.4. **Conflicts of interest**. We have established and maintain effective organisational and administrative arrangements with a view to taking all appropriate steps to identify and manage conflicts of interest between us and our users and relevant third parties, so as to prevent conflicts of interest from adversely affecting the interests of our users. In cases where such organisational and administrative arrangements are not sufficient to ensure that the risks of damage to your interests will be prevented, we will inform you of the nature and/or sources of the relevant conflicts of interest and the steps taken to mitigate those risks in order to allow you to make an informed decision as to whether to continue to transact with us. We reserve the right at all times to decline to act for you where we are not able to manage a conflict of interest in any other way.

14.1. **Your Transaction limits**. Your Binance Account may be subject to a limit on:

If Digital Assets that are no longer Supported Digital Assets remain in your Binance Account beyond a specified period notified to you, Binance may in its reasonable discretion convert such Digital Assets into a different type of Digital Asset that is a stablecoin. Binance shall notify you in advance of any conversion and you may withdraw such Digital Assets within a reasonable period as specified by Binance to you, prior to their conversion into stablecoins. 

We assume no liability in connection with any attempt to use your Binance Account for Digital Assets that we do not support nor for the conversion to a different type of Digital Asset, as described in this clause.

15.2. **Forks**. We may temporarily suspend any Binance Services in relation to a particular Digital Asset while we determine whether or not to support a Fork. We are under no obligation to support a Fork of a Digital Asset that you hold in your Binance Account, regardless of whether any resulting version of such Forked Digital Asset is a Dominant Digital Asset or not. If we elect to support a Fork of a Digital Asset, we will make a public announcement through our Website or by such other means as we may deem appropriate.

You acknowledge that we have no control over, nor do we have the ability to influence, the creation or implementation of a Fork. We can provide no assurances about the security, functionality or supply of any Digital Asset, including both the new Dominant Digital Asset or other Digital Assets subject to the relevant Fork. You may not be able to trade the Forked Digital Assets on the Platform and you may lose any value associated with the relevant Digital Assets.

15.3. **Backed Digital Assets**. We may from time to time support Digital Assets that purport to be backed by or otherwise tied or pegged in value to another asset, including Digital Assets, Fiat Currency or commodities such as silver or gold (“**Backed Digital Assets**”).

We have no obligation to purchase, repurchase or effect or facilitate the redemption of your Backed Digital Assets. We reserve the right to change, suspend, or discontinue any service in relation to any Backed Digital Asset. We make no representation as to whether any particular Backed Digital Asset will hold its value as against any asset, nor as to the amount or quality of reserves or collateral held by each issuer or any third party in relation to any Backed Digital Asset.

**16\. Account security**

16.1. **Your responsibility**. You are responsible for taking appropriate action to protect your hardware and data from viruses and malicious software, and any inappropriate material.

It is important that you monitor your Account History to ensure any unauthorised or suspicious activity on your Binance Account is identified and notified to us as soon as possible.

c. the changes are to make these Terms clearer to you; and/or

d. there is any other valid reason which means there is not time to give you notice. 

Where we are unable to give you advance notice, we will let you know of the change as soon as possible after it is made.

18.2. **When changes come into effect**. Save where changes come into effect immediately, the updated Terms will come into effect after we have given you notice. If you do not wish to accept the changes, you are free to close your Binance Account in accordance with clause ‎19.1 of these Terms. If we do not hear from you, we will assume that you have accepted the change and your continued access to or use of Binance Services will be deemed acceptance of the updated Terms.

18.3. **Changes to fees**. We may also make changes to the fees set out in the [Fee Structure](https://web.archive.org/web/20240515111941/https://www.binance.com/en-GB/fee/schedule) page on our Website, which includes introducing new fees and/or charges. If you do not wish to accept the changes, you are free to close your Binance Account in accordance with clause ‎19.1 of these Terms. If we do not hear from you, we will assume that you have accepted the change and your continued access to or use of the Binance Services will be deemed acceptance of the updated Terms.

**19\. Closing your Binance Account** 

19.1. **Your right to close your Binance Account**. You may terminate your Binance Account at any time by following the account termination procedures as prescribed by us from time to time. You will not be charged for terminating your Binance Account, although you will be required to pay any outstanding amounts owed to us. You authorise us to cancel or suspend any pending transactions at the time of cancellation, and to deduct any outstanding amounts that you owe us from your Binance Account.

In certain cases, you may not be able to close your Binance Account, including where:

a. you are trying to evade an investigation by relevant authorities;

b. you have a pending Transaction or an open Claim;

c. your Binance Account has any outstanding amounts owed to us; or

d. your Binance Account is subject to a freeze, hold, limitation or reserve.

19.2. **What happens when your Binance Account is closed**. If your Binance Account is closed, you will be required to withdraw all Digital Assets held in your Binance Account. In the event that you fail to withdraw your Digital Assets, or if you have not accessed your Binance Account for a continuous period of 90 days, will send you notice of our intention to treat your account as dormant. 

19.3. **What happens when your account becomes dormant.** If you do not respond to the notice in clause 19.2 within 30 days, we may:

a. mark your Binance Account as a dormant account;

b. convert the Digital Assets to a different type of Digital Asset. In doing so, we will not be liable for any loss of profit, tax obligations or any other loss, damage or expense incurred by you resulting from such conversion;

c. transfer such dormant account (including any Digital Assets held in the account) to another Binance Affiliate, any third-party custodian or an isolated wallet where we consider it is reasonably necessary to do so. If this happens, you have the right to retrieve your Digital Assets, subject to satisfying our reasonable verification requirements; 

d. adjust your dormant account such that you will receive a contractual claim on the quantity and type of Digital Assets, which were held on your Binance Account before being converted into a dormant account;

e. charge a dormant account fee which may be to cover the cost of maintaining the Digital Assets with any Binance Affiliate or any third party, with such fee to be withdrawn directly from the dormant account on a monthly basis; and

f. close a dormant account at any time.

After a dormant account is closed, it cannot be reactivated and you will need to register a new Binance Account, in accordance with these terms, if you wish to continue to use Binance Services. You acknowledge that we will be under no obligation to pay any reward, incentive or interest which we might otherwise have agreed to pay, under the applicable Product Terms, to your dormant account in relation to the Digital Assets credited to it.

**20\. Termination, suspension, holds and restrictions**

We will take reasonable steps to provide you with appropriate notice. However, there might be times when we are required not to do so by Applicable Law.

20.2. **Your acknowledgement**. You acknowledge and agree that:

a. the examples set out in clause ‎20.1 above of when we might take action to terminate, suspend, close or restrict your access to your Binance Account and/or the Binance Services is a non-exhaustive list; and

Where we place a hold on some or all of any Digital Assets or Fiat Currencies held in your Binance Account, or on your entire Binance Account, we may continue such hold until such time as evidence, acceptable to us, proves that you are entitled to possession of the Digital Assets and/or Fiat Currency held in your Binance Account. We will not get involved in any dispute, or the resolution of the dispute, relating to any Digital Assets and/or Fiat Currency held in your Binance Account. 

**20.5. Access to Binance Services in other jurisdictions**. Residents of some countries may only be able to access some, but not all, Binance Services.

The issuance of the ticket number commences the internal dispute resolution procedure. Binance will attempt to resolve the dispute internally as soon as possible. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute (which discussions shall remain confidential and be subject to applicable rules protecting settlement discussions from use as evidence in any legal proceeding).

31.2. In the event the dispute cannot be resolved satisfactorily, and you wish to assert a Claim against Binance, then you agree to set forth the basis of such Claim in writing in a “Notice of Claim,” as a form of prior notice to Binance. The Notice of Claim must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, (2) set forth the specific relief sought, (3) provide the original ticket number, and (4) include your custody account email. The Notice of Claim should be submitted to the following web address: [https://www.binance.com/en-GB/chat](https://web.archive.org/web/20240515111941/https://www.binance.com/en-GB/chat).  After you have provided the Notice of Claim to Binance, the dispute referenced in the Notice of Claim may be submitted by either Binance or you to arbitration in accordance with the below clause (Agreement to Arbitrate). 

31.3. For the avoidance of doubt, the submission of a dispute to Binance for resolution internally and the delivery of a Notice of Claim to Binance are prerequisites to commencement of an arbitration proceeding (or any other legal proceeding).

31.4. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Binance shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.

**32\. Agreement to Arbitrate**

32.1. Aside from where Applicable Law requires or provides you with a choice otherwise, you and Binance agree that, subject to the immediately preceding clause above (Notice of Claim and Dispute Resolution Period), any Claim shall be determined by mandatory final and binding individual (not class) arbitration administered by the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (“**HKIAC**”) in accordance with the HKIAC Rules for the time being in force, which rules are deemed incorporated by reference in this clause.

32.2. The seat of arbitration shall be Hong Kong.

32.4. The language of the arbitration shall be in English.

32.6. The arbitration provisions set forth in this clause will survive termination of these Terms.

32.7. Limitation period for filing: Any arbitration against Binance must be commenced by filing and serving a Notice of Arbitration in accordance with the HKIAC Rules within one (1) year after the date that the user asserting the Claim first found out or reasonably should have found out the alleged act, omission or default giving rise to the Claim (“**Limitation Period**”).  For the avoidance of doubt, the Limitation Period shall include the Dispute Resolution Period set out at clause 31.1.  There shall be no right to any remedy or relief for any Claim by the user if the Notice of Arbitration in respect of that Claim is not filed and served on Binance within that Limitation Period.  If the Limitation Period is contrary to applicable law, the user shall be required to bring any Claim against Binance within the shortest time period permitted by the applicable law. A Notice of Arbitration may be served on Binance in accordance with the Applicable Laws and rules of service.

32.8. Notice: if Binance commences arbitration against you, Binance will give you notice at the email address or mailing address you have provided. You agree that any notice sent to this email or mailing address shall be deemed effective for all purposes, including without limitation to determinations of the adequacy of service. It is your obligation to ensure that the email address and/or mailing address on file with Binance is up-to-date and accurate.

32.9. Nothing in these Terms shall prevent a user resident in the United Kingdom from having the right to bring a Claim against Binance in a court in the United Kingdom.

**33\. Confidentiality**

**33.1.** The parties agree that the arbitration shall be kept confidential. The existence of the arbitration, the existence or content of the Claim, all documents and information provided or exchanged in connection with the arbitration, and any submissions, orders or awards made in the arbitration shall be kept confidential and no party shall disclose any of the foregoing to any third party except the tribunal, the HKIAC, the parties, their counsels, experts, witnesses, accountants and auditors, insurers and reinsurers, and any other persons necessary to the conduct of the arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party may disclose such confidential information:

a. if the written consent of the other party is obtained;

b. to the extent required by applicable law or by the regulations of any regulatory or supervisory authority of competent jurisdiction to which the party is or may become subject to or pursuant to any order of court or other competent authority or tribunal of competent jurisdiction;

c. in connection with the commencement, pursuit or defence by a party of any bona fide legal proceedings to enforce or challenge any award rendered in the arbitration; and

d. to the extent that the relevant confidential information is in the public domain otherwise than by breach of this agreement.

This term of confidentiality in this clause shall survive termination of these Terms and conclusion or stay of any arbitration brought pursuant to these Terms.

**34\. Governing law**

34.1. Subject to clause 34.2 below and aside from where Applicable Law requires or provides you with a choice otherwise, these Terms (including this arbitration agreement) shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of Hong Kong.

34.2. If you are a user resident in the United Kingdom, these Terms shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the relevant laws of the United Kingdom.

**35\. Class action waiver**

You and Binance agree that any Claims shall be brought against Binance in an arbitration on an individual basis only and not as a plaintiff or class member in a purported class or representative action. You further agree to waive any right for such Claims to be brought, heard, or arbitrated as a class, collective, representative, or private attorney general action, to the extent permissible by applicable law. Combining or consolidating individual arbitrations into a single arbitration is not permitted without the consent of Binance.
