**a. Orders**

Upon sending an instruction of using Binance Services for Crypto-to-crypto Trading (an “Order”), your account will be immediately updated to reflect the open Orders, and your Orders will be included in Binance’s order book to match other users’ Orders. If one of your Orders fully or partially matches another user’s Order, Binance will execute an exchange (a “Transaction”).

To conclude a Transaction, you authorize Binance to temporarily control the Digital Currencies involved in your Transaction.

Once your Order has been matched with another user’s Order, you may not change, revoke or cancel Binance’s authorization to complete the Order. For any partially matched Order, you may cancel the unmatched part of the Order unless such portion has been matched. Binance reserves the right to reject any cancellation request related to the Order you have submitted. If your account does not have sufficient amount of Digital Currencies to execute an Order, Binance may cancel the entire Order, or execute part of the Order with the amount of Digital Currencies you have in your account (in each case, any Transaction related fees payable to Binance are deducted as stated in paragraph (c) below).

**c. Fees**

1.  The liquidity, market depth and dynamics of the trading market fluctuate violently and change rapidly. The use of leverage may work to your advantage or disadvantage, which may result in major gains or losses as the case may be.
    
2.  You are not eligible to receive forked currencies split from any blockchain assets in your Collateral Account, even if you have not engaged in any Margins Trading or borrowing at all.
    
3.  Loans carry risk, and the value of your blockchain assets may decline. If the value of your assets drops to a certain level, you are responsible for dealing with these market circumstances.
    
4.  In some market situations, you may find it difficult or impossible to liquidate a position. This may occur, for example, as a result of insufficient market liquidity or technical issues on Binance.
    
5.  Placing contingent Orders does not necessarily limit your losses to the expected amount, as market conditions may prevent you from executing such orders.
    
6.  Margins Trading does not have guaranteed measures against losses. As a borrower, you may suffer losses that exceed the amount you deposited into your Collateral Account.
    

**b. To start Margins Trading:**

1.  You represent and warrant that you are neither from the U.S. nor on any list of trade embargoes or economic sanctions, such as the Specially Designated National by OFAC (The Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury).
    
2.  You should fully understand the risks associated with Margins Trading and Lending, and be fully responsible for any trading and non-trading activities under your Binance Account and Collateral Account. You should not engage in Transactions or invest in funds that are beyond your financial capacities;
    
3.  You are fully responsible for knowing the true status of any position, even if Binance may present it incorrectly at any time;
    
4.  You agree to keep enough Digital Assets in your Collateral Account, as required by Binance for Users’ engagement in Margins Trading, and promptly repay your loan in full. Failure to keep enough assets or to timely repay the outstanding loan may result in forced liquidation of the assets in your Collateral Account;
    
5.  Even if with the ability to forcefully liquidate any position, Binance cannot guarantee to stop losses. If your assets are insufficient to repay the outstanding loan after the liquidation of your position, you are still liable for any further shortfall of assets;
    
6.  Binance may take measures, in its discretion and on your behalf, to reduce your potential losses, including but not limited to, transferring assets from your Collateral Account into your Binance Account and/or vice versa;
    
7.  During Binance system maintenance, you agree to be fully responsible for managing your Collateral Account under risks, including but not limited to, closing positions and repaying your loan.
    
8.  You agree to conduct all Transactions, Margins Trading and/or borrowing on your own, and be fully responsible for your activities. Binance assumes no liability for any loss or damage caused by your use of any Binance services or your unawareness of the risks associated with the use of Digital Assets or with your use of Binance Services.
    

### 7\. Lending Services

Unless otherwise provided by Binance, to borrow currencies, you must conclude with Binance a separate Lending Services User Agreement and open a special Collateral Account and/or finish other relevant procedures, following the completion of registration and identity verification for your Binance Account.

Binance shall not be held responsible for potential loss or opportunity cost in connection with any price change of the Digital Asset being processed during this settlement period.

f. In respect of Convert Limit Orders, Binance does not guarantee the fulfillment of the limit order, even if the market price hits or crosses the limit price set by the User, as orders are executed subject to market conditions and liquidity. Binance shall not be held responsible for any potential loss or opportunity cost due to the unsuccessful execution of limit orders in such case.

g. It is recommended that Users conduct independent research into different Digital Assets prior to using Binance Convert Services. Users bear full responsibility for any profit or loss in connection with their use of the Binance Convert Services.

If applicable law prohibits a one-year limitation period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law. Process; Notice: The party who intends to seek arbitration after the expiration of the Dispute Resolution Period set forth in paragraph 1, above, must submit a request to the HKIAC in accordance with the HKIAC Rules.

You agree that any notice sent to this email or mailing address shall be deemed effective for all purposes, including without limitation to determinations of adequacy of service. It is your obligation to ensure that the email address and/or mailing address on file with Binance is up-to-date and accurate. Seat of Arbitration: The seat of the arbitration shall be Hong Kong. Place of Hearing: The location of any in-person arbitration hearing shall be Hong Kong, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.

Class Action Waiver. ** You and Binance agree that any claims relating to these Terms or to your relationship with Binance as a user of Binance Services (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms) shall be brought against the other party in an arbitration on an individual basis only and not as a plaintiff or class member in a purported class or representative action. You and Binance further agree to waive any right for such claims to be brought, heard, or arbitrated as a class, collective, representative, or private attorney general action, to the extent permissible by applicable law.
