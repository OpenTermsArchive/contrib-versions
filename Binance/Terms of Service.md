**TERMS OF USE**
================

**Important Notification (8 December 2025):** 

[Binance.com](http://binance.com/) will soon become regulated in the Abu Dhabi Global Market (**ADGM**). As part of this transition, we are changing how we provide services to you.      

From 5 January 2026, Binance Services will be offered by three regulated Binance entities: Nest Services Limited (current provider), Nest Clearing and Custody Limited and Nest Trading Limited (new providers). To facilitate this new structure, we will transfer relevant terms, services and positions between these entities. These entities will also each become data controllers in relation to the provision of different Binance Services. 

From that date, the updated [Terms of Use](https://www.binance.com/en/about-legal/terms-new) and [Privacy Notice](https://www.binance.com/en/about-legal/New-Privacy-Notice-05January2026) will take effect, and the existing Terms of Use (below) and [Privacy Notice](https://www.binance.com/en/privacy) will no longer apply.
