You will need to comply with our identity verification procedures before you are permitted to open a Binance Account and access and use the Binance Services, by providing us with certain information about yourself and, where relevant, your Permitted Users. All information that you provide must be complete, accurate and truthful. You must update this information whenever it changes. 

You authorise us to make inquiries, whether directly or through third parties, that we consider necessary to verify your identity, and that of any Permitted Users, or protect you and/or us against fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing or other financial crime, and to take any action we deem necessary based on the results of such inquiries.

When we carry out inquiries, you acknowledge and understand that your personal data , and that of any Permitted Users, may be disclosed to identity verification, compliance data recordation, credit reference, fraud prevention, or financial crime agencies and that these agencies may respond to our inquiries in full.

8.2. **What happens when you provide information**. Your access to your Binance Account and the Transaction limits that apply to your use of the Binance Services may be altered as a result of information collected about you on an ongoing basis.

Your Binance Account can be accessed directly using the Platform or by such other mode of access (including APIs) as we may prescribe. You are only permitted to access your Binance Account by using the Access IDs we provide to you or your Permitted Users for such purposes. We may require multi-factor authentication to keep your Binance Account safe and secure.

The use of the Platform and other access methods may be subject to such additional terms as we communicate to you. 

9.2. **Restricting access to third parties**. You must ensure that any Binance Account(s) registered under your name will not be used by any person other than yourself or, with respect to Corporate Binance Accounts, your Permitted Users, other than in accordance with these Terms.

**10\. Account information and Transaction records**

10.1. **Your Account History**. You will be able to access your Account History on the Platform. You must review your Account History carefully and let us know if you see any entries or Transactions that you do not recognise or you think are incorrect within fourteen (14) calendar days of the date that your Account History is provided or made available to you. 

10.2. **Errors**. We may rectify any error in your Account History at any time, and reserve the right to void or reverse any Transaction involving or deriving from a Manifest Error or to amend the details of such Transaction to reflect what we reasonably consider to be the correct or fair details of such a Transaction absent Manifest Error. Without prejudice to the generality of the other terms in these Terms, and in the absence of fraud or bad faith, Binance shall in no circumstances be liable to you for any loss or demand of whatsoever nature you may suffer or incur in connection with any Manifest Error howsoever arising, whether direct or indirect, special or consequential, including, but not limited to, loss of profit or loss of opportunity, even if Binance had been advised of the possibility of the same arising or that the same were reasonably foreseeable.

10.3. **Information sharing**. We may be required under Applicable Law to share information about your Binance Account and Account History with third parties. You acknowledge and agree that we are entitled to disclose such information. For more information about how we process your personal data you can review our [Privacy Notice](https://web.archive.org/web/20240515111941/https://www.binance.com/en-GB/privacy). 

**USING YOUR ACCOUNT**

**11\. Instructions**

11.1. **Giving Instructions**. You must ensure that any Instruction submitted is complete and accurate. We are not required to verify the accuracy, authenticity or validity of any Instruction and will not monitor or reject Instructions on the basis that they are, or appear to be, duplicates. However, if we are in doubt as to the accuracy, authenticity or validity of an Instruction, we may refuse to act upon or defer acting upon any Instruction, or seek further information with respect to the Instruction.

Instructions are irrevocable and therefore once an Instruction has been submitted you, or your Permitted Users, have no right to rescind or withdraw it without our written consent. Your Instruction is not deemed to be received by us until it has been received by our server. Our record of all Instructions will be conclusive and binding on you for all purposes.

11.2. **Acting on your Instructions**. By submitting an Instruction you or your Permitted Users are authorising us to initiate the Transaction on your Binance Account. We are therefore authorised to credit or debit (or provide settlement information to third parties for the purposes of the third party crediting or debiting) your Digital Assets from your Binance Account in accordance with your Instruction. If you have insufficient Digital Assets or Fiat Currency in your Binance Account to effect the Transaction (i.e. less than the required amount to settle the Transaction and to pay all the fees associated with the Transaction), then we have the right to refuse to effect any Transaction. It is your responsibility to hold sufficient Digital Assets or Fiat Currency credited in your Binance Account.

11.3. **Protection of Instructions**. You are aware that Instructions and information transmitted on the Platform or by email are generally transmitted via the internet and may be routed via public, transnational installations which are not specifically protected. We cannot guarantee that the Instructions and information transmitted will be completely protected against unauthorised access, and you accept the associated risks.

11.4. **Withdrawals**. Subject to these Terms and any applicable Product Terms, and provided that you have sufficient balance on your Binance Account and the relevant Digital Assets are not on hold in your Binance Account in connection with any Binance Service, you may give Instructions to Binance to transfer Digital Assets to an external wallet address by submitting a withdrawal request on the Platform. Upon receipt of the withdrawal request, Binance will: (i) deduct your Binance Account balance; and (ii) initiate an on-chain transfer to an external wallet designated by you. Binance may not process a withdrawal request if, in our reasonable opinion, we consider that Applicable Law prevents the execution of the relevant withdrawal. Binance may also suspend withdrawals at such time deemed appropriate by Binance to resolve any incidents on the Platform. Once such incidents have been resolved, Binance will resume withdrawals.

**12\. Transactions**

12.1. **Entering into Transactions**. You may enter into Transactions directly with us, or directly with other users, which may or may not be facilitated by us. 

We do not represent or warrant that any Transaction will be completed successfully or within a specific time period. 

12.2. **Unauthorised Transactions**. You are responsible for the control and use of your Binance Account. As such, we will assume that you, or a Permitted User, have authorised any Instruction sent from your Binance Account unless we are notified otherwise. It is important that you monitor your Account History to ensure any unauthorised or suspicious activity on your Binance Account is identified and notified to us as soon as possible. We are not responsible for any claim or losses resulting from a Transaction executed as a result of an unauthorised Instruction unless you have notified us in accordance with this clause.

12.3. **Retention of Transaction information**. To facilitate compliance with global industry standards for data retention, you agree to permit us (but agree to not require us) to keep a record of all Transaction information for the lifetime of your Binance Account as long as it is required to fulfil their intended purposes, or such other period as prescribed by Applicable Law. Please review our [Privacy Notice](https://web.archive.org/web/20240515111941/https://www.binance.com/en-GB/privacy) for more information on how we collect and use data relating to the use and performance of our Sites and the Binance Services.

**13\. Material interests and conflicts**

13.1. **Binance group**. You understand that Binance is a member of a group of companies which is involved in activities connected with Digital Assets.

13.2. **Nature of our duties**. You understand and agree that neither your relationship with us nor any Binance Service we provide to you, nor any other matter, will give rise to any duties on our part or on the part of any Binance Affiliate, whether legal, equitable, fiduciary in nature, save as are expressly set out in these terms. In particular, we and any Binance Affiliate may from time to time act in more than one capacity, and in those capacities we may receive fees or commissions from more than one user (including you). You agree that we may act in such capacities and provide any other Binance Services or carry out any business with or for you, any Binance Affiliate or any other user.

13.3. **Material interests**. You understand and agree that neither we nor any Binance Affiliate will be required to: (1) have regard to any information known to us, or to any Binance Affiliate, which is a material interest; (2) disclose any such information to you; or (3) use any such information for your benefit. You further acknowledge that from time to time we may receive general market information in the course of providing Binance Services to you, which we may use in the ordinary course of our business.

13.4. **Conflicts of interest**. We have established and maintain effective organisational and administrative arrangements with a view to taking all appropriate steps to identify and manage conflicts of interest between us and our users and relevant third parties, so as to prevent conflicts of interest from adversely affecting the interests of our users. In cases where such organisational and administrative arrangements are not sufficient to ensure that the risks of damage to your interests will be prevented, we will inform you of the nature and/or sources of the relevant conflicts of interest and the steps taken to mitigate those risks in order to allow you to make an informed decision as to whether to continue to transact with us. We reserve the right at all times to decline to act for you where we are not able to manage a conflict of interest in any other way. 

**14\. Transaction limits** 

14.1. **Your Transaction limits**. Your Binance Account may be subject to a limit on:

a. the amount or volume of Transactions you may undertake in connection with your Binance Account; and/or

b. the amount or value of Fiat Currency or Digital Assets you may transfer into or out of your Binance Account, 

in each case in a given period (e.g. daily). Any applicable limits are shown in your Binance Account. 

14.2. **Changes to your Transaction limits**. We reserve the right to change any Transaction limit that applies to your Binance Account at any time at our absolute discretion. It may also be possible for you to request a change in your limits. Any change will be made in our absolute discretion and will be subject to any further conditions that we deem necessary. 

**15\. Supported Digital Assets**

15.1. **Supported Digital Assets**. The Binance Services are only available in connection with Supported Digital Assets, which may change
