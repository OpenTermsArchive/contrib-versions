### 1) Scope and Application

Fox News Network, LLC ("Fox News," "our" or "we") wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information from and about you. This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information collected through services such as websites, mobile sites, applications ("apps"), and widgets that link to or are otherwise subject to this privacy policy (collectively, the "Fox News Services"). Information about our affiliated companies ("Fox News Affiliates") is available at [www.foxcorporation.com](https://www.foxcorporation.com/).

Certain state privacy laws require particular disclosures in privacy policies. California residents, please see the California Consumer Privacy Act Notice in Section 8 below. Consumers in Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and other states with similar privacy laws, please see Section 9 below. By using Fox News Services, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

As set forth in our Terms of Use for Fox Nation at [https://nation.foxnews.com/article/terms-of-use-5bb6868d5245a0001905011d/](https://nation.foxnews.com/article/terms-of-use-5bb6868d5245a0001905011d/) and our Terms of Use for other Fox News Services at [https://www.foxnews.com/terms-of-use](https://www.foxnews.com/terms-of-use), the Fox News Services are for a general audience, are not targeted to children, and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.

This Privacy Policy applies to all users, including both those who use the Fox News Services without being registered with or subscribing to a Fox News Service and those who have registered with or subscribed to a Fox News Service.

This Privacy Policy applies to our collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information (i.e., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address). It also describes generally our practices for handling non-personal information (for example, interests, demographics and services usage). Please note that the information that we may collect, use, and/or disclose varies based upon a user’s interactions with the Fox News Services

 

### 2) Collection of Information

Depending on your interactions with us, Fox News and our service providers may collect the following information from and about you:

**Registration Information** is information you submit to register for a Fox News Service, for example, to create an account, post comments, receive a newsletter, or enter a contest or sweepstakes. Registration Information may also include, for example, name, email address, phone number, gender, zip code, user/display name, and birthday. Depending on when and how you register, we may collect email address, but not a password.

**Customer Service and Feedback Information** is information you submit to request customer support or to provide feedback about Fox News Services, such as name, email address, and state.

**Personal Financial and Commercial Information** is information that you submit to purchase a product, subscribe to a service, or make payments.

**Public Information and Posts** consist of comments or content that you post to the Fox News Services and the information about you that accompanies those posts or content, which may include a name, user/display name, comments, predictions, likes (or "kudos"), status, profile information and picture. Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines.

**Activity Information.** When you access and interact with the Fox News Services, Fox News and its service providers may collect certain information about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection to the Fox News Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Fox News Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, or other transactional information for that device. In certain circumstances, we also may collect geolocation data (including your precise location).

Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, local storage, and other mechanisms) use various approaches to collect and store data. Some of these technologies store data in the browser or on your device. Other technologies may use network-related or other information to recognize your device (e.g., IP address). Our websites, apps and other services may use these technologies, for example, when you first request a web page and to store data on your computer or other device so the website or app can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that service. Depending on your interactions with us, these technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Fox News Services, such as pages you have visited, search history, and the video and other content you have viewed.

Other parties that support the Fox News Services, for example, by serving advertisements, providing analytics, or other services, may also use these technologies to collect similar information when you use the Fox News Services or other parties’ services. Those other parties may also use these technologies, along with activity information they collect, to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a mobile device and a laptop or other computer. In some circumstances, their use is governed by the privacy policies of the parties using such technologies. For more information about advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies, including your choices with respect to them, see the section entitled "To deliver relevant advertisements," below.

Your browser may be initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, and to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information, including on how to clear data from local storage and, depending on your browser, how to turn off other data collection by the browser. For more information about Google Analytics, please review the site "How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services," located at [https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites). To opt out of Google Analytics specifically, please go to [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features, content or personalization available through the Fox News Services.

**Information from Other Sources.** We may supplement the information we collect with information from other sources, such as publicly available information about your online and offline activity from social media services, advertising technology companies, advertisers, commercially available sources, and information from our Fox News Affiliates or business partners.

Depending on your interactions with us, Fox News may not have collected information from you for each of the categories above.

**'Do Not Track'.** At this time we do not respond to the ‘Do Not Track’ signal, as we await the work of interested stakeholders and others to develop standards for how the ‘Do Not Track’ signal should be interpreted.

**To provide co-branded services and features.** We may offer co-branded services or features, such as contests, sweepstakes or other promotions together with other companies ("Co-Branded Services"). These Co-Branded Services may be hosted on Fox News Services or on that other party’s service. By virtue of these relationships, we may share information you submit in connection with the Co-Branded Service with that party. That other party’s use of your information will be governed by its privacy policy.

**To deliver relevant advertisements.** Fox News and our service providers may use information we collect from and about you as described in this Privacy Policy to deliver and measure relevant, more personalized ads to you when you use the Fox News Services or another service (on any of your devices). This may include, for example, sharing certain information with advertising technology companies (e.g., identity partners), such as an advertising identifier for your device, IP address, or a "hash" of an identifier (i.e., a value generated using a cryptographic hash algorithm). In some instances, these entities may return an online identification code that we may store in a first party cookie, or other similar technology, for our use in online and cross-channel advertising and it may be shared with advertising companies to enable interest-based and targeted advertising. To opt out of this use for Fox Business, please go to [privacy.foxbusiness.com/main/web/main](https://privacy.foxbusiness.com/main/web/main) and for all other Fox News Services, please go to [privacy.foxnews.com/main/web/main](https://privacy.foxnews.com/main/web/main).

As noted above, advertising technology companies and advertisers may use cookies and similar technologies to collect information, such as demographic information, inferred interests, aggregated information, and information about the different devices and/or browsers you use and your activity on such devices and browsers, to assist them in delivering advertising that is more relevant to your interests. Such information may also be used to deliver more relevant advertising to you across marketing channels, including email.

Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on the Fox News Services.

**Location of Data.** The Fox News Services are hosted in and managed from the United States. If you are a user located outside the United States, you understand and consent to having any personal information processed in the United States or in any other country in which we have facilities or in which we engage service providers. The United States and other countries’ data protection laws may not be the same as those in your jurisdiction. In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in the United States may be entitled to access your personal information.

**Linked Services.** The Fox News Services may be linked to sites operated by unaffiliated companies, and may carry advertisements or offer content, functionality, games, newsletters, contests or sweepstakes, or applications developed and maintained by unaffiliated companies. Fox News is not responsible for the privacy practices of unaffiliated companies, and once you leave the Fox News Services or click an advertisement you should check the applicable privacy policy of the other service.

In addition, Fox News is not responsible for the privacy or data security practices of other organizations, such as Meta, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), Apple, Google, Microsoft or any other app developer, app provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider, or device manufacturer, including in connection with any information you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with the Fox News Services.

**Collection of Personal Financial Information by a Payment Service.** In some cases, we may use an unaffiliated payment service to allow you to purchase a product or make payments ("Payment Service"). If you wish to purchase a product or make a payment using a Payment Service, you will be directed to a Payment Service webpage. Any information that you provide to a Payment Service will be subject to the applicable Payment Service’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for, any Payment Service’s use of information collected through any Payment Service.

If you subscribe to Fox Nation, we and/or Payment Service provider(s) may use payment information to help provide the Fox Nation services. For example, payment information may be used to retrieve account information for a subscriber, to determine whether a subscriber is eligible for promotions, and to detect abuse of the Fox Nation services.

Remember that even after you cancel your account, or if you ask us to delete your personal information, copies of some information from your account may remain viewable in some circumstances where, for example, you have shared information with social media or other services. Because of the nature of caching technology, your account may not be instantly inaccessible to others. We may also retain backup information related to your account on our servers for some time after cancellation or your request for deletion, for fraud detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security or recordkeeping policies. It may not always be possible to completely remove or delete all of your information due to technical constraints or contractual, financial or legal requirements.
