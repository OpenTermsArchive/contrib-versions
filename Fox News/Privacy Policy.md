### 1) SCOPE AND APPLICATION

Fox Digital Services, LLC, along with Fox News, Fox Sports, Fox Broadcasting Company, and Fox Television Stations (collectively "Company" or "we") wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information from and about you. This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information collected through services such as websites, mobile sites, applications ("apps"), and widgets that link to or are otherwise subject to this privacy policy (collectively, the "Company Services"). Information about our other affiliated companies ("Company Affiliates") is available at [www.foxcorporation.com](https://www.foxnews.com/www.foxcorporation.com).

Certain state privacy laws require particular disclosures in privacy policies. California residents, please see the California Consumer Privacy Act Notice in Section 8 below. Consumers in Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut and other states with similar privacy laws, please see Section 9 below. By using Company Services, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

The Company Services are for a general audience, are not targeted to children, and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18 years of age.

This Privacy Policy applies to all users, including both those who use the Company Services without being registered with or subscribing to a Company Service and those who have registered with or subscribed to a Company Service.

This Privacy Policy applies to Company's collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information (i.e., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address). It also describes generally Company's practices for handling non-personal information (for example, interests, demographics, and services usage). Please note that the information that we may collect, use, and/or disclose varies based upon a user's interactions with the Company Services.

 

### 2) COLLECTION OF INFORMATION

Depending on your interactions with us, Company and our service providers may collect the following information from and about you:

**Registration Information** is information you submit to register for a Company Service, for example, to create an account, post comments or reactions, receive a newsletter, or enter a contest, sweepstakes, or other promotion. Registration Information may also include, for example, name, email address, phone number, gender, zip code, user/display name, favorites, entry name, and birthday. Depending on when and how you register, we may collect email address, but not a password.

**Subscription Information** is information we receive from business partners in connection with the purchase of subscriptions to our services through the business partner. This may include, for example, your email address.

**Customer Service and Feedback Information** is information you submit to request customer support or to provide feedback about Company Services, such as name, email address, phone number, city, and state.

**User-Uploaded Content** consists of video, audio recordings, photographs, or other material that you upload as part of our news-gathering function and other services.

**Personal Financial and Commercial Information** is information that you submit to purchase or request a subscription of a product or service from us or to make payments. Please note that if you use a Third Party Payment Service (e.g., ApplePay, PayPal), as described in the Information from Third Party Payment Services section below, information you provide to that Service is subject to its privacy policy.

**Information from Third Party Payment Services.** If you choose to use an unaffiliated payment service ("Third Party Payment Service"), such as Link, ApplePay, PayPal, or via an app store (e.g., Apple App Store or Google Play), to purchase a product or make payments, we may receive a unique identifier and other information in connection with subscription (e.g., that you have a valid subscription to the applicable service). If you wish to purchase a product or make a payment using a Third Party Payment Service, you will be directed to a Third Party Payment Service webpage or service. Any information that you provide to a Third Party Payment Service will be subject to the applicable Third Party Payment Service's privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for, any Third Party Payment Service's use of information collected through that Service.

**Public Information and Posts** consist of comments or content that you post to the Company Services and the information about you that accompanies those posts or content, which may include a name, user/display name/entry name, comments, predictions, reactions, status, profile information and picture or avatar. Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines.

**Information from Social Media.** If you access or log-in to a Company Service through a social media service or connect a Company Service to a social media service, information we collect may also include user name associated with that social media service, any information or content you have permitted the social media service to share with us, such as your profile picture or email address. When you access the Company Services through social media services or when you connect a Company Service to social media services, you are authorizing Company to collect, store, and use that information and content in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**Authenticated Content Access.** To access certain content via the Company Services, you may be redirected to your television content provider's registration or log in page, where you will be required to sign in using your television content provider account. Information you provide through your television content provider's registration/log in page is subject to that provider's privacy policy. As part of the authentication process, we may receive a unique identifier or other information (e.g., that you are entitled to receive that content).

**Activity Information.** When you access and interact with the Company Services, Company and its service providers may collect certain information about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection to the Company Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Company Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, or other transactional information for that device. In certain circumstances, we also may collect geolocation data (including your precise location).

Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, local storage, and other mechanisms) use various approaches to collect and store data. Some of these technologies store data in the browser or on your device. Other technologies may use network-related or other information to recognize your device (e.g., IP address). Company's websites, apps and other services may use these technologies, for example, when you first request a web page and to store data on your computer or other device so the website or app can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that service. Depending on your interactions with us, these technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Company Services, such as pages you have visited, search history, and the video and other content you have viewed.

Other parties that support the Company Services, for example, by serving advertisements, providing analytics, or other services, may also use these technologies to collect similar information when you use the Company Services or other parties' services. Those other parties may also use these technologies, along with activity information they collect, to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a mobile device and a laptop or other computer. In some circumstances, their use is governed by the privacy policies of the parties using such technologies. For more information about advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies, including your choices with respect to them, see the section entitled "To deliver relevant advertisements," below.

Your browser may be initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, and to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information, including on how to clear data from local storage and, depending on your browser, how to turn off other data collection by the browser. For more information about Google Analytics, please review the site "How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services," located at [https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites). To opt out of Google Analytics specifically, please go to [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features, content or personalization available through the Company Services.

**Information from Other Sources.** We may supplement the information we collect with information from other sources, such as publicly available information about your online and offline activity from social media services, advertising technology companies, advertisers, commercially available sources, and information from our Company Affiliates or business partners.

Depending on your interactions with us, Company may not have collected information from you for each of the categories above.

We may also share the same information with the social media service provider. By logging in with or connecting your Company Services account with a social media service, you are authorizing us to share certain information we collect from and about you with the social media service provider, other users and your friends and you understand that the social media service's use of the shared information will be governed by the social media service's privacy policy.
