We will do this in order to fulfil our contractual obligations to you, or because it is in our legitimate interests to do so.
    
    ### **Transfer of your personal data outside the EEA**
    
    We may need to transfer your personal data within the European Economic Area (EEA) or to another third country, for example the UK, USA or India, in the following circumstances:
    
    * Where you have requested a service which is fulfilled by one of our group companies which sit in another country of the EEA or another third country; or
    * Where we work with a supplier which processes some of its personal data within another country of the EEA or another third country.
    
    For any personal data transfers to the UK or within the EEA, we will continue to follow all regulatory and legal requirements set out in the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, and any subsequent arrangements that are agreed.Other third countries may not have the same data protection laws as the UK and the EEA and so your personal data may not be subject to the same protections. However, in such cases, we will make sure that any transfer of your personal data to countries outside the UK and EEA is subject to appropriate safeguards as if it were being processed inside the UK or EEA and under the guiding principles set out in this privacy policy.

    * have your data processed in a fair, lawful and transparent way;
    * be informed about how your personal data is being used, an example being this privacy policy;
    * access personal data we hold about you;

    We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
    
    We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one calendar month. Occasionally it could take us longer than this if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

    **Security of your personal data**
    
    We take the security of your personal data very seriously. We have implemented various strategies, controls, policies and measures to keep your data secure and keep these measures under close review. We protect your data by using encryption techniques and we use other safeguards such as firewalls and password protection.

    **Retention of your personal data**
    
    In broad terms, we will only retain your personal data for as long as is necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy policy. This means that the retention periods will vary according to the type of the data and the reason that we have the data in the first place.
    
    To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
    
    Personal information will be deleted/destroyed or anonymized at the end of the retention period.
