The formal stuff: IKEA Ireland Limited is a company registered in Ireland with its registered office at 6th Floor, 2 Grand Canal Square, Dublin 2 and company number 400143. Our VAT number is 6420 143R. We are licensed to sell under the IKEA brand name by Inter IKEA Systems B.V., a company registered in the Netherlands.

Please note the delivery prices detailed in any IKEA printed material are subject to change in accordance with the prices on ikea.ie.

### **Online delivery dates**

For all deliveries you will be given the option to select a delivery date when placing your order. 

Truck deliveries are for larger furniture deliveries. If you have chosen the selected day of delivery, then your goods will be delivered to you in 4-30 days, depending on the delivery slot you have chosen at the checkout.

Parcel deliveries have a minimum lead time of 2 days. For parcel and truck deliveries, we will strive to deliver your order within 30 days of the order date unless otherwise agreed between us.

We will try our best to meet the delivery date, however, there may be times when we are unable to do this and your confirmed delivery date might change accordingly. We would advise you not to make any plans to accept your delivery, for example booking time off from work, until we have confirmed the date with you. If you will not be available, please request a different delivery date as soon as possible and no later than 48 hours before the planned delivery date by speaking to the IKEA Customer Support Centre:  **[contact us](https://www.ikea.com/ie/en/customer-service/contact-us/)**.

### **Changing the date of delivery**

If you would like to change your delivery time or date, please contact the IKEA Customer Support Centre and they will advise if this is possible: **[contact us](https://www.ikea.com/ie/en/customer-service/contact-us/)**.

### **Our liability**

We will try our best to meet the agreed delivery date, however, there may be times when we are unable to do this and your confirmed delivery date will be amended accordingly. We will do our best to contact you to rearrange an alternative delivery timeslot or date. We will not be responsible for any losses (including loss of revenue, profits, anticipated savings, goodwill or business opportunity, for any injury to your reputation) incurred due to a delay in delivery arising out of any cause beyond our control. We will not be responsible for any stolen goods after the handover of goods between the customer and the delivery driver.

### **Delivery restrictions**

Before the delivery, please ensure that there is sufficient access and space and that any staircases and lifts providing access are suitable for the delivery. Please move fragile objects which could be damaged during the delivery, including lights, vases, and pictures.  Every effort will be made to deliver the products to your room(s) of choice, provided it is safe and practical to do so. However, if our delivery team believe it is unsafe to deliver the products to the room(s) of choice, then an alternative room will be agreed with you where possible.

If our delivery team consider that delivery to the room(s) of your choice is likely to cause damage to the products or to the property, they will let you know and record the concern on a delivery document. You can still accept the delivery but we will not be liable for any damage caused to the products or the property. However, our delivery team will take reasonable care when delivering the products.

Our delivery team are not permitted to and will not: remove doors, windows, doorframes etc. in order to complete the delivery. You must arrange this before the delivery takes place. Our delivery team do not carry any specialised lifting equipment and will not unpack or assemble delivered products or remove any packaging. Our delivery team will not remove their footwear whilst making deliveries. If you are concerned about possible damage to flooring, please make sure you cover the flooring with protective sheets.   

Please note that any changes you make to your order after your order has been placed might have an impact on the delivery service we can offer and the price of the delivery.

### **Important information**

When you arrange your delivery, we will ask you to provide certain information. This information will be recorded on the delivery document and the delivery will take place at the delivery address you specify. If you provide us with incomplete, incorrect or inaccurate information or instructions, we may cancel the delivery by informing you in writing.

You are responsible for ensuring that you are available to accept delivery. If you are not, there must be an adult available who is capable of receiving delivery on your behalf, and you agree that we can rely on their instructions as if they were your own.   
  
Our delivery staff are not permitted to leave the order unless you or someone on your behalf is present at the time of the delivery (unless you have selected the ‘authority to leave’ option at the point of checkout). If you are not at home at the agreed time for delivery and collection our service partner will try to contact you to make another appointment. Please note that this will result in a new service order and is therefore chargeable. When delivery is made, we will not require the exchange of the handheld devices. On delivery, you will be asked to examine the products, check the condition of the packaging and whether the correct number of packages have been delivered.  Deliveries will be signed for either by yourself,  or digitally by our delivery staff on your behalf in your presence, or our delivery staff will request to take pictures of the goods delivered. Accepting or refusing such a request will not impact your delivery. All pictures will be stored in accordance with Data Protection legislation.  If there are any issues, the IKEA customer support centre will be the point of contact. Missing products will be re-ordered and damaged/incorrect products will be returned and replaced and delivered free of charge. This will not affect your legal right to notify us within a reasonable time at a later date if you find a defect in your products. If you refuse to sign the delivery document, this will be taken as a refusal to accept delivery.

### **Authority to Leave**

If you have selected the authority to leave option at checkout, you will be providing our driver's permission to leave your order at the delivery address without a signature and you agree that the order is deemed ‘delivered’ when left at the delivery address. When you choose the authority to leave at the checkout, you accept full responsibility for the safe delivery of the order. You will receive a call from the driver 1 hour before the delivery to let you know the driver is on the way. The driver will leave your order in a secure and sheltered place if safe to do so. If the driver at his own discretion decides that it is not safe to do so, the driver may decide not to leave the order. In this event, our customer services team will contact you to arrange a new delivery date.  If you have chosen authority to leave at the checkout for your room of choice delivery but you are not going to be home, your order will be left at your front door. For flats or buildings with multiple dwellings, this is your flat front door, given the driver is able to enter the building. Pictures will be taken to confirm delivery was made.   We will not be responsible for any damaged or stolen goods after the delivery with the authority to leave has taken place.  If you have not selected the authority to leave option at checkout and you are not in to accept your delivery, unfortunately, we will not be able to deliver your order.  

### **Damaged items**

If items within the packaging are faulty or damaged, please notify the delivery driver who will seek to resolve this. If you notice any damage to items following delivery, please notify IKEA Customer Service Contact Centre as soon as possible after delivery. Please keep any damaged products so that we can inspect them at a later date. If you dispose of any damaged product before we have had the opportunity to inspect it, then this could affect any claim. We will always attempt to replace any damaged product. However, if we are unable to do so we will refund you the full amount you have paid for the product(s) together with any relevant delivery charges.

### **Privacy** 

Our Privacy policy (together with our website’s terms of use) sets out why we collect data from you and how it will be processed by IKEA. Please read the Privacy policy available on our website, carefully so that you understand our views and practices and how we will treat your data. 

For the purposes of the Data Protection Act 2018 and any future amendments or subsequent legislation, IKEA Limited is the “Data Controller”. 

### **Governing law and Jurisdiction**

**Returns and Cancellation**
----------------------------

You can return new and unused product(s) within 365 days of making your purchase, subject to the limitations set out in these Terms and Conditions. IKEA will provide a refund for product(s) returned with the original proof of purchase, in new and unused condition and with the original packaging. You are responsible for any costs incurred in the returning of the product(s) unless the product is faulty or not as described. IKEA will refund the price paid for the goods via the original payment method.

A refund may be refused, or the value of the refund reduced if the product(s) are not able to be sold at full retail value as a result of you handling the product(s) in such a way that the product(s) are no longer saleable at full retail value. IKEA at its sole discretion, may reduce your refund to reflect any reduction in the retail value of the goods. Any refund and reduction will be proportionate to the retail value of the product(s) in the condition returned.

### **Exclusions**

There are certain circumstances, where at our sole discretion we are not able to accept returns, cancel orders or offer a refund unless the product(s) is faulty (or unless there is any other breach of your statutory rights). These exclusions are as follows:

* where you do not have proof of purchase;
* where the product(s) are returned without full packaging;
* where the product(s) are not returned in a saleable condition; and
* where the product is a food or drink, perishable product (cut flowers or plants), or custom-made product(s) (including worktops) or any other product(s) to which the exclusions in regulation 28 of the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013, apply.

* See more information about cancellation or return of orders online or via e-mail
    
    **Cancellation or return of orders made online**
    ------------------------------------------------
    
    You can cancel your whole order up until 14 days after the delivery date and we will provide you with a full refund (including the basic delivery charge).
    
    If you decide to cancel an order that has been delivered and would like us to collect part of, or the whole order, you may be eligible for a collection charge. Where possible, this will be deducted from the refund due to you. The collection charge fee will depend on the location.
    
    ### **How to cancel**
    
    You can let us know you want to cancel using our [Contact Us](https://www.ikea.com/ie/en/customer-service/contact-us/) page to call or write to us. Letting us know as soon as you can will help us process your request quickly and easily, but don’t worry, we can still cancel your order up to 14 days after it has been delivered.
    
    When contacting us please have your order number ready so we can help you quickly and remember to clearly state which product(s) you would like to cancel or return if you choose to write or email. 
    
    ### **Returning your delivered items**
    
    If you have already received your order, it needs to be returned to IKEA in full and in resalable condition before the refund is made. We also ask that you return the original packaging.
    
    You can return the whole or part of your order to any IKEA Store or Order and Collection Point. Please take your Order Confirmation email, delivery receipt and the payment card with which you paid for the product(s).
    
    You agree to take reasonable care of the product(s) from the time that they are delivered to you until the time that they are returned. If you decide to return the product(s) to us after you have started to assemble them then you should disassemble them to the extent necessary to allow them to be properly returned. However, if disassembly is reasonably likely to cause damage to an item please leave it assembled and [Contact Us](https://www.ikea.com/ie/en/customer-service/contact-us/) to let us know.
    
    ### **Collection of items**
    
    If you need IKEA to collect your order, you can arrange this from our [Contact Us](https://www.ikea.com/ie/en/customer-service/contact-us/) page. Please have your order number available. You will be eligible for a collection charge unless the product is faulty or not as described, in which case IKEA will cover the cost of return. Where a collection charge is applied, this will be deducted from the refund due to you. The collection charge fee is dependent on the collection location.
    
    Collection of the product(s) will only take place from the delivery address to which they were delivered and will be subject to the following:
    
    * You agree to provide IKEA Shop Online with as much detail as possible of relevant features of the delivery address (for example, which floor the items are to be collected from, whether there are any narrow doors etc) in order to help our representative prepare for the collection;
    * You agree to ensure that there is suitable access to the chosen collection location;
    * If our representative reasonably considers that collection from the room of your choice is likely to cause damage to the product(s) or to your property, they will inform you and record this concern on the collection document. You may instruct our representative to collect the product(s) in spite of such concern but we will not be liable for any damage caused to your property or to the product(s) as a consequence of us attempting collection on your instructions (provided that reasonable care is taken in collecting the product(s));
    * You agree to give our representative all product(s) which are being returned, including all component parts of such product(s) and all related items or accessories (and if possible the original packaging) which are included in the price of the product(s) being returned;
    * A collection document must be signed by you to confirm that the collection has taken place. The collection document will be provided by the representative who comes to collect your product(s); and
    * If you are not personally available to accept collection of the product(s) you may appoint someone else to do so on your behalf as long as there is an adult capable of supervising collection on your behalf, and you agree that we will be entitled to rely on their instructions as if they were your own.
    
    ### **Refund**
    
    We will make any refund due to you as soon as possible and within the following timelines:
    
    * If you cancel before you have received the product(s), 14 days after you inform us of your decision to cancel the contract; or 
    * If you have returned product(s) back to us, 14 days after the day on which we receive the product(s) back from you or if earlier, the day on which you provide us with evidence that you have sent the product(s) back to us.
    
    You will be refunded to the original method of payment used at the time of purchase.
    

**The IKEA ‘Sleep on it’ mattress exchange policy**
---------------------------------------------------

‘Sleep on it’ is our IKEA 365-night trial scheme for newly purchased mattresses. It takes time for you and your new mattress to get used to each other. That’s why we give you 365 nights to be sure you're compatible. So, after you’ve ‘slept on it’ a while, if you find it too firm, too soft, or too something else, you can exchange your mattress for another. Simply take your mattress back to any IKEA store with your receipt and one of our sleep experts can help you find one that suits you better. When you've found your perfect match, you can sleep easy for years to come with [our free 10-year guarantee](https://www.ikea.com/ie/en/customer-service/returns-claims/guarantee/#8fac6a00-e501-11e9-a34d-61574039a3e4).   

It may help to know, initially your new mattress can seem a bit too firm. Allow one month for your body to get used to the mattress and for the mattress to get used to your body. Roll packed mattresses regain their shape after 3-4 days of use. To get the best comfort you also need the right pillow. Make sure that you have a pillow that suits you and your new mattress. Mattress toppers can also be used to further enhance comfort and mattress protectors offer additional protection to extend the life of your mattress.

### **Terms and Conditions**

* You may exchange your newly purchased mattress once within 365 days of the date stated on your valid receipt or order form if you don’t love it, provided that it is not dirty, marked or damaged and all care instructions have been strictly followed. If the proper care instructions have not been followed, then the exchange will be refused. Care instructions can be found in the product information provided with the mattress.
* A valid proof of purchase (a valid till receipt or IKEA order number) is required to exchange your mattress. If you do not have your receipt or order number, IKEA may be able to help you locate it, but IKEA cannot guarantee that this will be located. If a valid proof of purchase cannot be presented, IKEA will be unable to honour the policy.
