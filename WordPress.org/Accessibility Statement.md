Accessibility
=============

The WordPress community and the open source WordPress project is committed to being as inclusive and accessible as possible. We want users, regardless of device or ability, to be able to publish content and maintain a website or application built with WordPress.

WordPress aims to make the WordPress Admin and bundled themes fully compliant with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA, where possible.

All new and updated code released in WordPress must conform with these guidelines as per the [WordPress Accessibility Coding Standards](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/accessibility/). Some current features and functionality in development may not yet fully comply, and known issues are listed in the [WordPress Trac “accessibility” focus](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/focus/accessibility).

While the WordPress project cannot guarantee that all Themes are compliant, the [accessibility-ready themes](https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/accessibility-ready/) have been checked by the Theme Review Team to ensure that these themes pass their [basic accessibility requirements](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/required/).

The Accessibility Team
----------------------

The [WordPress Accessibility Team](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/) provides accessibility expertise across the project to improve the accessibility of WordPress core and resources.

The [Accessibility Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/) shares the [best practices](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/best-practices/) for web accessibility, a list of [accessibility tools](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/which-tools-can-i-use/useful-tools/), the [testing we do](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/get-involved/audits-and-testing/) to improve WordPress, themes, and plugins, and [how to get involved](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/get-involved/) in WordPress accessibility.

To report an Accessibility issue you’ve encountered in WordPress or on WordPress.org, please see the Accessibility Handbook page on [Reporting Accessibility Issues](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/reporting-issues/).

ATAG Statement
--------------

The [Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines version 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/), or ATAG, are a set of guidelines that govern how to create a tool for creating web pages that are both accessible and encourages the creation of accessible content.

The [WordPress accessibility coding standards](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/accessibility/) require new or updated code to meet the standards of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.0 at level AA. ATAG conformance is an additional goal beyond WCAG compliance.

An application that fully conforms with ATAG 2.0 must not only be usable by people with disabilities, but it should **enable** and **encourage** all users to create accessible content and assist them in repairing accessibility mistakes, without requiring any additional tools or add-ons.

WordPress is not currently conforming with ATAG 2.0, but pledges to pursue features that are accessible and which help users create accessible content in pursuit of the long-term goal of ATAG compliance.
