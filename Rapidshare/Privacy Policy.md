Is your personal data stored?

In general you can access our website without disclosing who you are.

In order to use the services of RapidShare, however, we request that you provide certain personal information on the registration page. During registration you will be asked to provide contact information (e.g. your E-Mail address). This information will be used to open your account.

To improve the performance of our services we collect selected statistical information. We use tracking services from third parties as well as browser cookies to collect anonymous statistical information about the usability of our website and the usability of our services as a whole.

Information relating to our services

When necessary, we will send you information related to our services. For example if you change your password. As a rule you cannot unsubscribe from such notifications because these E-Mails are not sent for advertising purposes.

We will also communicate with you in order to inform you about services from our website in which you have expressed an interest. You can deactivate these E-Mails in my Account.

What happens to data you have stored or transferred?

During each upload process, in addition to the data itself, the following data will be stored:

The MD5 checksum of the data: (An MD5 value is generated for each file uploaded to RapidShare. It is a 16-character string (128-bit number) that can be used to uniquely identify a file based on what it contains. This value is stored with the data. If data is uploaded that violates our terms of use, it can be identified by the MD5 value so that the same file can no longer be uploaded). For each upload, the IP-address of the computer and the time of the upload, as well as the account attribution of the data are stored.

We do not open or analyse your stored data. We do not grant others access to this data. We do not use independent service providers in security-sensitive areas, and we work exclusively with servers in Germany and Switzerland.

The security of your personal data

Keeping your personal data secure is very important to us. We comply with generally accepted standards for the protection of personal data transmitted to us both during transfer and after reception of this data. Nevertheless, no method of transfer via the Internet or electronic storage is completely secure. As a result we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data. Should you have queries regarding the security of our website, you can contact us us as follows.

Deleting your personal data

If your personal data changes or if you no longer wish to use our service, then you can correct, update, supplement, delete/remove or deactivate it by making the appropriate change in your account, or by contacting us via contact.

Which statutory regulations apply?

Our services take place in compliance with international legal data protection guidelines. In addition, the content of the files you have transferred is subject to protection from unauthorised access by us or third parties by Swiss law. We reserve the right to disclose your personal data if we are of the opinion that this disclosure is required in order to protect our rights and/or to comply with a lawsuit, a warrant or a legal procedure that involves our services.

Changes to these Privacy Guidelines

We reserve the right to change this data protection statement. We strongly encourage you to take notice of messages related to this. However, the personal data you have already submitted is governed by the preceding guidelines and will not be affected by such changes unless you agree to them.

Should we decide to change our data protection guidelines, we will publish these changes within this data protection statement on the website and other locations in order to inform you about them.
