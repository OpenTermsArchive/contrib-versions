What happens with the data you have stored or transferred?

During each upload process, in addition to the data itself, the following data will be stored:

The MD5-checksum of the data (an MD5 value is generated with each saved file in RapidShare. This is a 16-character figure, which yields the same value on repeated evaluation of the same data. This value is stored with the data. If data is stored with RapidShare which infringes our terms of use, this can be identified by the MD5-value, so that the same file can no longer be uploaded). With each upload in addition the IP-address of the computer and the time of the upload, as well as the account attribution of the data are stored.

We do not open or analyse your stored data. We allow no one access to this data, we use no independent service provider in security-sensitive areas, and we work exclusively with servers in Germany and Switzerland.
