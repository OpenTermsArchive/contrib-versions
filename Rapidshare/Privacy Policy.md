This document is a binding integral part of the contract with our Customers. RapidShare is bound to keep this integral part of the contract legally effective regarding all upload and download activities of all Customers.

Protection of personal information Which data does RapidShare store about me?

RapidShare collects only the data that is needed to open and manage your account. This data will not be used for any other purpose. RapidShare takes every affordable precaution to protect your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse as well as against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction by taking all administrative, technical, and physical measures.

Will RapidShare communicate information about Customers?

If we are legally obliged to turn over information about the origin of a file, we will fulfil that obligation. The legal circumstances will be evaluated individually in each case by our legal department. Without a founded legal basis, no information will be given to a requesting authority.

Does RapidShare monitor my stored files?

Data privacy is an important integral part of our service. Nobody can access your files without knowledge of the complete download link. This does also apply to RapidShare employees. There is no software that will scan your files for certain patterns or the like.

Which data does RapidShare store about the files I upload?

With every upload the following data is stored in addition to the actual file:

*   MD5 checksum of the uploaded file
    
    There is a program, which calculates the MD5 checksum for each file immediately after the upload. The MD5 checksum is a 16 bytes value that is always the same when calculated for the same file. This value is stored in connection with the file. If you upload and distribute files , we will delete the file upon notification and add the MD5 checksum to a blacklist, so the same file cannot be uploaded again.
    
*   IP address of the computer from which the upload is started
*   timestamp of the upload
*   to which account the file is supposed to be attached

Will RapidShare communicate information about the files a customer has downloaded?

RapidShare does not store this information. Accordingly, we could not pass on this information, even if we wanted to.
