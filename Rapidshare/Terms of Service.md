Terms of Use

RapidShare AG (hereinafter: “RapidShare”) provides Cloud Storage services for its users based on the following provisions: The General Terms of Use (hereinafter: “ToU”) govern access to and the use of the services, websites and client-software offered by RapidShare (hereinafter: “services”) and the associated information, text, graphics and/or other materials saved, sent or retrieved using these services (collectively referred to as “files”). Access to and the use of the services shall depend on acceptance of and compliance with these ToU. By indicating acceptance at registration and by using the services, users declare that they agree to the ToU.

I. General

1.  RapidShare provides its users with an infrastructure which enables the user to save electronic files on internet servers. After the saving process is complete, the file is saved in the user’s user account (hereinafter: “account”). The user can delete his or her files at any time.
    
2.  RapidShare does not open and view the files of its users. The files are not catalogued or listed in table of contents by RapidShare. Only you, the owner of the files, control whether others may access the files, how files are accessed and which files may be accessed. RapidShare does not provide a search function with which RapidShare’s infrastructure can be searched.
    
3.  Some services offered by RapidShare are free of charge but do require the user at least to be registered with RapidShare. With RapidPro, RapidShare also offers a fee-based service which considerably increases performance and ease of use.
    
4.  Users are obliged to keep the user names and passwords of registered accounts confidential. User names and passwords must not be passed on to third parties. This shall also include the passing on of login data to other Cloud Storage services or websites which promise services in conjunction with those offered by RapidShare. RapidShare shall not be liable for damage arising from unauthorised access. Login data may not be used in such a way that a third party and/or software could activate automated processes (e.g. upload, download, RapidSave, changing the account settings) where these login data are used to access RapidShare.
    
5.  The commercial sale of accounts with or without fee-based services together with any other products and services and/or the implementation of our services in third-party software shall require RapidShare’s consent. RapidShare reserves the right to block accounts which are used by several persons not living in the same household, or which are used or resold commercially without RapidShare’s consent.
    

II. Upload Rules

1.  In principle, users may save any file with RapidShare and distribute it, irrespective of the file format or file content. However, files whose possession is illegal in certain jurisdictions may not be saved, and no files whose distribution is illegal may be directly or/and indirectly distributed.
    
2.  After having been notified, RapidShare shall immediately block access for users and/or groups involved to such files. The user shall have 30 days within which to object to this block. If no objection is received after 30 days, the file shall be deleted permanently.
    
3.  RapidShare is entitled to terminate without notice the contractual relationship with users who infringe these upload rules, block access by the users concerned to its service and/or irrevocably delete the accounts of such users, including all the contents.
    

III. Free Use

1.  RapidShare shall provide its users with service and storage capacities at its discretion. RapidShare shall be entitled to change and remove the properties and functionality of the services and the associated additional functions and/or include new services in its offer.
    
2.  Free accounts and their saved files will be deleted automatically, if no login is made during longer periods by the user. Please find the information about the service and properties of free accounts on rapidshare.com.
    

IV. Fee-based services

1.  As well as the free use described in clause III. (3), users of the RapidShare infrastructure have the option of upgrading their accounts to include RapidPro, enabling them to use additional services.
    
2.  RapidShare provides information about the additional services available which only RapidPro users may use on the rapidshare.com website. RapidShare shall be entitled at any time to remove individual services from its range, to change the contents of RapidPro services and/or to include new services in its range. If a user has acquired a fee-based product and changes are made to this product to the detriment of the user, he or she shall be entitled to terminate the contract within a period of 30 days after notification of the change. Taking into account the ToU of the payment provider concerned, the user shall receive a proportional reimbursement of the RapidPro price he or she has paid. Reimbursement shall be excluded if the user has received RapidPro as part of a promotion or in another way without making a direct payment to RapidShare.
    
3.  If the user does not exercise his or her right of termination or continues to use the product, the changes shall be considered to have been accepted and shall become an effective integral part of the contract. RapidShare shall undertake to remind its users of this provision in particular with the notification of revised ToU.
    
4.  RapidShare wishes to offer you the most comprehensive service possible to meet your individual requirements. However, if we discover that our services are being used in such a way that the service provided to other users is disrupted or restricted, or RapidShare is damaged, we reserve the right to terminate use and cancel the contract with you.
    
5.  RapidShare shall not reimburse any damage arising from the negligent passing on of passwords or unauthorised access to accounts if the unauthorised access is not the result of intent or gross negligence on the part of RapidShare or its vicarious agents.
    

V. Payment

1.  To acquire the fee-based RapidPro service, RapidShare offers its customers various options for acquiring prepaid credits (known as Rapids). 1 Rapid equals 1 Euro cent. The individual payment options are explained clearly on the website.
    
2.  You are able to withdraw within 30 days from the date of purchase and receive, taking into account the ToU of the payment provider concerned, a proportional reimbursement.
    
3.  RapidShare points out expressly that it will block accounts immediately if the Rapids acquired for these accounts are reversed without RapidShare’s consent. RapidShare is unable to clarify the reasons behind reversed payments and will refer the user to his or her selected payment provider should such payment problems arise. Should an account which has been blocked owing to a reversed payment be reopened, RapidShare shall be entitled to charge an administrative fee of a maximum of 2000 Rapids (equals EUR 20) from the customer’s Rapids.
    
4.  The user must report any theft of Rapids or suspicion of misuse of his or her account to RapidShare’s support department immediately. Where criminal offences have been committed, the user must also report this to the local police and, in the event of loss or damage, must assist with resolving the case and minimising the loss or damage to the best of his or her knowledge. Refunds may be applied for within two months from the event giving rise to the damage. Claims from applications made after this deadline shall not be refunded.
    

VI. Reseller

1.  In many countries, payment for Rapids is not possible with the payment options offered directly by RapidShare. For this reason, RapidShare cooperates with resellers, who sell Rapids in these countries in their own name and for their own account. You will find a list of resellers authorised by RapidShare here: Resellers
    
2.  RapidShare points out that resellers are not RapidShare employees and do not conclude contracts in the name of RapidShare. With regard to this method of purchase, users who acquire Rapids through resellers enter into a contractual relationship with their respective reseller only. RapidShare shall not process any requests for support which relate to a payment transaction with a reseller.
    
3.  Furthermore, RapidShare points out that there are various people and companies who are not authorised resellers who nevertheless claim to be selling Rapids for RapidShare. RapidShare reserves the right to block accounts for which Rapids have been acquired through unauthorised resellers. RapidShare cannot provide refunds for payments made to unauthorised third parties.
    

VII. Availability. Data Security

1.  In principle, RapidShare shall provide the functions listed in clause I. (1) 24 hours a day and seven days a week, but only with a guaranteed monthly average availability rate of 99.5%. Periods during which the server cannot be accessed online because of technical or other problems, which are beyond RapidShare’s influence (third party faults, force majeure, etc.) shall be excluded.
    
2.  RapidShare shall endeavour to keep necessary maintenance work as brief as possible. RapidShare shall only temporarily restrict access to its services if the security or functionality of network operations urgently requires such action. Should such restrictions (for example, to prevent hacker attacks) be required, RapidShare shall inform its users of the reasons behind this restriction in due time. If it is apparent that downtimes for maintenance or software updates will last longer than three hours, RapidShare shall notify its users of this at least three days before carrying out the work.
    

VIII. Backing up your content

1.  The user shall be responsible for backing up on his or her computer or on another mass storage device all the files he or she stores with RapidShare or accesses through our service. RapidShare provides no guarantee or warranty that contents which the user saves with RapidShare or accesses through RapidShare’s services will be protected against accidental damage, corruption or loss.
    
2.  RapidShare offers functions with which you may release or publish your files for a third party. For this reason, you should consider carefully which files you wish to release or publish. RapidShare shall accept no liability for damage or loss arising from the release of your files. By activating the upload function, third parties could also save unwanted files in this folder. For your own security, you should therefore regularly check the contents of shared folders. You should also bear in mind that you could be held liable for the dissemination of files located in your shared folders whose contents are illegal or protected by copyright.
    

IX. Miscellaneous

1.  RapidShare shall inform registered users of changes to the ToU when they become effective.
    
2.  Should a contractual provision or a provision in the ToU be or become completely or partly ineffective, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining contract or ToU. The ineffective provision shall be replaced by a legally valid provision which most closely approximates the purpose of this provision. This shall apply by analogy to any gaps or omissions.
