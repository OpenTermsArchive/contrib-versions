As part of our recent suspension of ads in Russia, we will also pause ads on Google properties and networks globally for advertisers based in Russia.

Due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, we will be temporarily pausing Google Ads from serving to users located in Russia.

Welcome to the Shopping ads Policy centre
-----------------------------------------

### Overview of our Shopping ads policies and how we enforce them

We strive to support a healthy digital advertising ecosystem â€“ one that's trustworthy and transparent, and that works for customers, advertisers and publishers. The purpose of this Policy centre is to help you build Shopping ads and local inventory ads campaigns that align with both our [ads policies](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6008942) and the Shopping ads policies listed below.

These policies are designed to ensure a safe and positive experience for our customers while abiding by applicable laws. This means that our policies prohibit content that is harmful to customers and the overall advertising ecosystem.

Our Shopping ads policies cover four broad areas:

**[Prohibited content](#con):** Content that you're not allowed to promote on the Google Network

**[Prohibited practices](#pra):** Things that you can't do if you want to advertise with us

**[Restricted content](#res):** Content that you can advertise, but with limitations

**[Editorial and technical](#ed):** Quality standards for your ads and website

Click through the policies below for policy definitions, examples and troubleshooting steps.

We use a combination of Google AI and human evaluation to ensure that Shopping ads comply with these policies. Our enforcement technologies use Google AI, modelled on human reviewers' decisions, to help protect our customers and keep our ad platforms safe. More complex, nuanced or severe cases are often reviewed and evaluated by our specially trained experts.

We take action on content that violates our policies. This may include disapproving violative Shopping ads so that they aren't served, temporarily capping ad impressions for some accounts flagged by Google AI and suspending accounts for repeat or egregious violations.

We will provide you with information on our decision for any policy violation enforcement actions that we take. If one of your Shopping ads is disapproved, [you can fix that Shopping ad or appeal the decision](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6109185). You can also [appeal an account suspension decision](https://ads.google.com/nav/selectaccount?authuser=0&dst=/aw/overview?supportResource%3Dsuspension_help) (for this link to work, you'll need to be signed in to your Google Ads account).

### Prohibited content

#### [Counterfeit goods](https://support.google.com/merchants/merchants/answer/6149993)

> Google prohibits the sale or promotion for sale of counterfeit products. Counterfeit goods contain a trademark or logo that is identical to or substantially indistinguishable from the trademark or logo of another. They mimic the brand features of the product in an attempt to pass themselves off as a genuine product of the brand owner.  
>   
> This policy applies to the content of your Shopping ads and your website.

#### [Dangerous products](https://support.google.com/merchants/merchants/answer/6150004)

> Google wants to help keep people safe both online and offline, so we don't allow the promotion of some products that can cause damage, harm or injury.
> 
> _Examples of dangerous products:_ Recreational drugs (chemical or herbal); psychoactive substances; equipment to facilitate drug use; weapons, ammunition, explosive materials and fireworks; instructions for making explosives or other harmful products; tobacco products.

#### [Products that enable dishonest behaviour](https://support.google.com/merchants/merchants/answer/6150005)

> Google values honesty and fairness, so we don't allow the promotion of products that are designed to enable dishonest behaviour.
> 
> _Examples of products that enable dishonest behaviour:_ Hacking software or instructions; fake documents; academic cheating products.

#### [Inappropriate content](https://support.google.com/merchants/merchants/answer/6149990)

> Google values diversity and respect for others. We strive to avoid offending users so we don't allow ads or destinations that display shocking content or promote hatred, intolerance, discrimination or violence.
> 
> _Examples of inappropriate or offensive content:_ Bullying or intimidation of an individual or group; racial discrimination; hate group paraphernalia; graphic crime scene or accident images; cruelty to animals; murder; self-harm; extortion or blackmail; the sale or trade of endangered species.

#### [Unsupported Shopping ads content](https://support.google.com/merchants/merchants/answer/6150006)

> Google aims to enable businesses to promote a wide variety of products but some Google products and platforms may not be optimised to appropriately support all content types.
> 
> For this reason, Shopping ads and free product listings don't allow the promotion of certain content where we don't offer an optimal user experience.
> 
> Note that because these limitations are specific to Shopping ads and free listings, they do not impact policies on other Google products or platforms, where functionality differs or additional support mechanisms are in place.

### Prohibited practices

#### [Abuse of the ad network](https://support.google.com/merchants/merchants/answer/6150118)

#### [Irresponsible data collection and use](https://support.google.com/merchants/merchants/answer/6150122)

#### [Misrepresentation](https://support.google.com/merchants/merchants/answer/6150127)

> * Promotions that prompt users to initiate a purchase, download or other commitment without first providing all of the relevant information and obtaining the user's explicit consent
> * Promotions that represent you or your products in a way that is not accurate, realistic and truthful

### Restricted content

For that reason, we allow promotion of the content below but on a limited basis.

> Shopping ads don't restrict the use of trademarks by merchants in the title or description of an ad when it's for a trademarked product or a product compatible with the trademarked product. Merchants need to reference trademarks to be able to communicate to users what they're offering and users need that information as it's relevant to their searches. We'll review claims by trademark owners that the use of their trademark is likely to cause consumers confusion about the origin of a product. To submit a trademark-related complaint if you're an owner of the trademark, use the [Report a legal issue in Shopping ads](https://support.google.com/legal/contact/TM_CF_Shopping?product=productsearch) form.

#### [High fat, sugar and salt food and beverages](https://support.google.com/merchants/merchants/answer/11191042)

> We support responsible advertising of food and beverages. High fat, sugar and salt (HFSS) food and beverages (F&B) Shopping ads are allowed if they comply with our policies. We consider ads to be promoting the sale of HFSS products when one or more HFSS food items, beverages or meals are promoted in the ad (text, imagery, audio and/or video) or destination site. Specifically, Shopping ads that contain HFSS food and beverages are now prohibited from targeting minors.
> 
> The information reflected in this policy is not intended to be legal advice and we expect all merchants and partners to comply with the local laws for any region that their ads target, including local requirements that may differ from this HFSS food and beverages policy.

### Editorial and technical requirements

We want to deliver ads that are engaging for users without being annoying or difficult to interact with, so we've developed editorial requirements to help keep your ads appealing to users. We've also specified technical requirements to help users and advertisers get the most out of the variety of ad formats that we offer.

#### [Editorial and professional requirements](https://support.google.com/merchants/merchants/answer/6150244)

> To provide a quality customer experience, Google requires all Shopping ads to meet high professional and editorial standards. We only allow promotions that are clear and professional in appearance. These ads should lead customers to products and landing pages that are relevant, useful and easy to interact with.

About our policies
------------------

> Shopping ads enable businesses of all sizes from around the world to promote a wide variety of products and websites on Google and across our network. We want to help you reach existing and potential customers and audiences. However, to help create a safe and positive experience for users, we listen to their feedback and concerns about the types of ads that they view. We also regularly review changes in online trends and practices, industry norms and regulations. And finally, in crafting our policies, we also think about our values and culture as a company, as well as operational, technical and business considerations. As a result, we have created a set of policies that apply to all promotions on the Google Network.
> 
> Google requires advertisers to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and the Google policies described above. It's important that you familiarise yourself with and keep up to date on these requirements for the places where your business operates, and any other places where your ads are showing. When we find content that violates these requirements, we may block it from appearing. In cases of repeated or egregious violations, we may stop you from advertising with us.
> 
> Advertisers have a responsibility not to promote content or engage in behaviour that risks harm to our users, employees or the Ads ecosystem. If we find such content or behaviour, we may take action, including but not limited to restricting or blocking your ads or suspending your account.
