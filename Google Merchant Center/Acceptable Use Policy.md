Shopping ads policies
=====================

Due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, we will be temporarily pausing Google Ads from serving to users located in Russia.

As part of our recent suspension of ads in Russia, we will also pause ads on Google properties and networks globally for advertisers based in Russia.

Welcome to the Shopping ads Policy centre
-----------------------------------------

Here you'll find the requirements for advertising on the Google Network.

### Prohibited content

#### [Counterfeit goods](https://support.google.com/merchants/merchants/answer/6149993)

> Google prohibits the sale or promotion for sale of counterfeit products. Counterfeit goods contain a trademark or logo that is identical to or substantially indistinguishable from the trademark or logo of another. They mimic the brand features of the product in an attempt to pass themselves off as a genuine product of the brand owner.  
>   
> This policy applies to the content of your Shopping ads and your website.

#### [Dangerous products](https://support.google.com/merchants/merchants/answer/6150004)

> Google wants to help keep people safe both online and offline, so we don’t allow the promotion of some products that cause damage, harm or injury.
> 
> _Examples of dangerous products:_ Recreational drugs (chemical or herbal); psychoactive substances; equipment to facilitate drug use; weapons, ammunition, explosive materials and fireworks; instructions for making explosives or other harmful products; tobacco products.

#### [Products that enable dishonest behaviour](https://support.google.com/merchants/merchants/answer/6150005)

> Google values honesty and fairness, so we don’t allow the promotion of products that are designed to enable dishonest behaviour.
> 
> _Examples of products that enable dishonest behaviour:_ Hacking software or instructions; fake documents; academic cheating products.

#### [Inappropriate content](https://support.google.com/merchants/merchants/answer/6149990)

> Google values diversity and respect for others, and we strive to avoid offending users, so we don’t allow ads or destinations that display shocking content or promote hatred, intolerance, discrimination or violence.
> 
> _Examples of inappropriate or offensive content:_ Bullying or intimidation of an individual or group; racial discrimination; hate-group paraphernalia; graphic crime-scene or accident images; cruelty to animals; murder; self-harm; extortion or blackmail; sale or trade of endangered species.

#### [Unsupported Shopping ads content](https://support.google.com/merchants/merchants/answer/6150006)

> Google aims to enable businesses to promote a wide variety of products, but some Google products and platforms may not be optimised to appropriately support all content types.
> 
> For this reason, Shopping ads and free product listings don't allow the promotion of certain content where we don't offer an optimal user experience.
> 
> Note that because these limitations are specific to Shopping ads and free listings, they do not impact policies on other Google products or platforms, where functionality differs or additional support mechanisms are in place.

  

### Prohibited practices

#### [Abuse of the ad network](https://support.google.com/merchants/merchants/answer/6150118)

>

About our policies
------------------

> Shopping ads enable businesses of all sizes, from around the world, to promote a wide variety of products and websites on Google and across our network. We want to help you reach existing and potential customers and audiences. However, to help create a safe and positive experience for users, we listen to their feedback and concerns about the types of ads that they see. We also regularly review changes in online trends and practices, industry norms and regulations. And finally, in crafting our policies, we also think about our values and culture as a company, as well as operational, technical and business considerations. As a result, we have created a set of policies that apply to all promotions on the Google Network.
> 
> Google requires that advertisers comply with all applicable laws and regulations and the Google policies described above. It's important that you familiarise yourself with and keep up to date on these requirements for the places where your business operates, as well as any other places that your ads are showing. When we find content that violates these requirements, we may block it from appearing, and in cases of repeated or egregious violations, we may stop you from advertising with us.
