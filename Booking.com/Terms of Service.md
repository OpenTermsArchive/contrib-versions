A1. Definitions

1\. Some of the words you’ll see have very specific meanings, so please check out the ‘[Booking.com dictionary](#nov2021_terms_dictionary_heading)’ at the end of these Terms.

A2. About these terms

1\. When you complete your Booking, you accept these Terms and any other terms that you’re provided with during the booking process.

2\. If anything in these Terms is (or becomes) invalid or, unenforceable:

*   it will still be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law
*   you will still be bound by everything else in the Terms.

3\. These Terms are laid out like this:

*   Section A: general terms, for all types of Travel Experiences.
*   Sections B to F: specific terms, for just one type of Travel Experience:
    *   Section B: Accommodations
    *   Section C: Attractions
    *   Section D: Car rentals
    *   Section E: Flights
    *   Section F: Private and Public Transport
*   If there’s any mismatch between general and specific terms, the specific terms will apply.

4\. The English version of these Terms is the original. If there’s any dispute about the Terms, or any mismatch between the Terms in English and in another language, the Terms as they appear in English will apply. (You can change the language at the top of this page.)

A3. About Booking.com

1\. When you book an accommodation, flight or attraction, [Booking.com B.V.](https://secure.booking.com/content/legal.en-gb.html?) provides and is responsible for the Platform – but not the Travel Experience itself (see A4.4 below).

2\. When you book a rental car, or private or public transport, Booking.com Transport Limited provides and is responsible for the Platform – but not the Travel Experience itself (see A4.4 below).

3\. We work with companies that provide local support services (e.g. Customer Support or account management). They don’t:

*   control or manage our Platform
*   have their own Platform
*   have any legal or contractual relationship with you
*   provide Travel Experiences
*   represent us, enter into contracts or accept legal documents in our name
*   operate as our ‘process or service agents’.

A4. Our Platform

1\. We take reasonable care in providing our Platform, but we can’t guarantee that everything on it is accurate (we get information from the Service Providers). To the extent permitted by law, we can’t be held responsible for any errors, any interruptions, or any missing bits of information - although we will do everything we can to correct/fix them as soon as we can.

2\. Our Platform is not a recommendation or endorsement of any Service Provider or its products, services, facilities, vehicles, etc.

3\. We’re not a party to the terms between you and the Service Provider. The Service Provider is solely responsible for the Travel Experience.

4\. To make a Booking, you may need to create an Account. Please make sure all your info (including payment and contact details) is correct and up to date, or you might find you can’t access your Travel Experience(s). You’re responsible for anything that happens with your Account, so please don’t let anyone else use it, and please keep your username and password secret.

5\. We will show you the offers that are available to you, in (what we think is) the right language for you. You can change to another language whenever you like.

6\. Unless otherwise indicated, you need to be at least 16 to use the Platform.

A5. Our values

1\. You will:

*   abide by [Our values](https://secure.booking.com/trust-and-safety/values.en-gb.html?)
*   comply with all applicable laws
*   cooperate with any anti-fraud/anti-money laundering checks we need to carry out
*   not use the Platform to cause a nuisance or make fake Bookings
*   use the Travel Experience and/or Platform for their intended purpose
*   not cause any nuisance or damage, and not behave inappropriately to the Service Provider’s personnel (or anyone else, for that matter).

A6. Prices

1\. When you make a Booking, you agree to pay the cost of the Travel Experience, including any charges and taxes that may apply.

2\. Some of the prices you see may have been rounded to the nearest whole number. The price you pay will be based on the original, 'non-rounded' price (although the actual difference will be tiny anyway).

3\. Obvious errors and misprints are not binding. For example: if you book a premium car or a night in a luxury suite that was mistakenly offered for €1, we may simply cancel that Booking and refund anything you’ve paid.

4\. A crossed-out price indicates the price of a like-for-like Booking without the price reduction applied (‘like-for-like’ means same dates, same policies, same quality of accommodation/vehicle/class of travel, etc.).

A7. Payment

1\. For some products/services, the Service Provider will require an Upfront Payment and/or a payment taken during your Travel Experience.

*   **If we organise your payment,** we (or, in some cases, our affiliate in the country your payment originates from) will be responsible for managing your payment and ensuring the completion of your transaction with our Service Provider. In this case, your payment constitutes final settlement of the 'due and payable' price.
*   **If the Service Provider charges you,** this will usually be in person at the start of your Travel Experience, but it could also be (for example) that your credit card is charged when you book, or you pay when you check out of your Accommodation. This depends on the Upfront Payment policy of the Service Provider as communicated to you in the booking process.

2\. If the Service Provider requires an Upfront Payment, it may be taken or pre-authorised when you make your Booking, and it may be non-refundable. So before you book, please check the Service Provider’s Upfront Payments policy (available during the booking process), which we don’t influence and aren’t responsible for.

3\. If you know of or suspect any fraud or unauthorised use of your Payment Method, please contact your payment provider, who may cover any resulting charges, possibly minus an excess.

4\. If the currency selected on the Platform isn't the same as the Service Provider's currency, we may:

*   show prices in your own currency
*   offer you the Pay In Your Own Currency option.

You’ll see our Currency Conversion Rate during checkout, in the Booking details of your Account, or (if you don’t have an Account) in the email we send you. If we charge you fees in connection with any such services, you’ll find the fee expressed as a percentage over European Central Bank rates. Your card issuer may charge you a foreign transaction fee.

5\. We will store your Payment Method details for future transactions after collecting your consent.

A8. Policies

1\. When you make a Booking, you accept the applicable policies as displayed in the booking process. You'll find each Service Provider's cancellation policy and any other policies (about age requirements, security/damage deposits, additional supplements for group Bookings, extra beds, breakfast, pets, cards accepted, etc.) on our Platform: on the Service Provider information pages, during the booking process, in the fine print, and/or in the confirmation email or ticket (if applicable).

2\. If you cancel a Booking or don’t show up, any cancellation/no-show fee and any refund will depend on the Service Provider’s cancellation/no-show policy.

3\. Some Bookings can’t be cancelled for free, while others can only be cancelled for free before a deadline.

4\. If you book a Travel Experience by paying in advance (including all price components and/or a damage deposit if applicable), the Service Provider may cancel the Booking without notice if they can't collect the balance on the date specified. If they do, any non-refundable payment you’ve made will only be refunded at their discretion. It's your responsibility to make sure the payment goes ahead on time (that your bank, debit card or credit card details are correct, and that there's enough money available in your account).

5\. If you think you're not going to arrive on time, please contact your Service Provider and tell them when they can expect you, so they don't cancel your Booking. If you’re late, we are not liable for the consequences (e.g. the cancellation of your Booking, or any fees the Service Provider may charge).

6\. As the person making the Booking, you are responsible for the actions and behaviour (in relation to the Travel Experience) of everyone in the group. You are also responsible for obtaining their permission before providing us with their personal data.

A9. Privacy and cookies

1\. If you book an accommodation, flight, or attraction, please see our [Privacy and Cookies Statement](https://secure.booking.com/content/privacy.en-gb.html?) for more information on privacy, cookies, and how we might contact you and process personal data

2\. If you book ground transport, please see the [Rentalcars.com Privacy Statement](https://www.rentalcars.com/en/privacy), [Cars.booking.com Privacy Statement](https://cars.booking.com/PrivacyPolicy.do), or [Taxi.booking.com Privacy Statement](https://taxi.booking.com/information/privacy) as appropriate to find out how we process your personal data.

A10. Accessibility requests

1\. If you have any accessibility requests:

*   about our Platform and/or services, please contact our Customer Service team
*   about your Travel Experience (wheelchair access, walk-in baths, etc.), please contact your Service Provider - or the airport, train station, etc.

A11. Insurance

1\. If you have bought insurance through our Platform, please refer to the policy document(s) for the terms and for further information. These Terms do not apply to insurance.

A12. Genius

1\. The Genius rate is a discounted rate offered by participating Service Providers for certain products/services.

2\. Genius rates are for members of the Booking.com Genius programme. There are no membership fees, and it’s easy to become a member - just create an Account. Membership and rates are non-transferable. Membership is linked to a specific Account. Membership can also be linked to specific campaigns or incentives.

3\. There are different ‘Genius Levels’, based on how many Accommodation Bookings you’ve made in a given period. Each level provides different travel rewards.

4\. We may change any feature of the Genius programme, including the membership levels and the way the programme is structured.

5\. For more details, visit [https://www.booking.com/genius.html](https://secure.booking.com/genius.en-gb.html?).

A13. Rewards, Credits & Wallet

1\. We may issue Rewards to you – at our sole discretion, and subject to (a) the terms here in A13 and (b) any Individual Reward Criteria that apply. If we make a clerical error (i) in calculating your Rewards or (ii) in converting currencies related to your Rewards, we can always change or correct any balances shown.

2\. **How to get Rewards.** You might, for example, get a Reward by booking at a participating hotel, or by making a certain number of Bookings in a given time period. When a Reward is available, we’ll explain what the specific conditions are and how to use it.

3\. **Where to find your Rewards.** Once you’ve received one or more Rewards, you’ll find a ‘Rewards and Wallet’ link in your Booking.com Account menu. Under the ‘Rewards’ tab, you’ll see all the Rewards you’ve earned, what actions (if any) still need to be taken to obtain the Reward(s), and any other terms and conditions.

4\. **Types of Rewards.** Rewards give you (a) Credits in your Wallet or (b) something different (e.g. a Credit Card Cashback, or a voucher). We’ll explain each Reward at the appropriate time.

5\. **How to get Credits.** Credits are usually issued as a result of getting a Reward. But we may issue Credits for other reasons - if your Travel Experience didn’t live up to our usual high standards, for example.

6\. **Where to find your Credits.** Once you’ve received some Credits, you’ll find a ‘Rewards and Wallet’ link in your Booking.com Account menu. Under the ‘Wallet’ tab, you’ll see your total Credits balance (split into Travel Credits and Cash Credits, if you have both kinds). You’ll see when Credits were received or spent, and when they’ll expire. If you have Cash Credits, you’ll also see a link to cash them out.

7\. **Types of Credits.** Travel Credits can **only** be spent on certain Travel Experiences. We’ll show you which Travel Experiences you can pay for with Travel Credits (which specific accommodations, attractions, car rentals, etc.). Cash Credits can be cashed out to your Payment Method (click ‘Withdraw Cash Credit’), or spent on any Travel Experience that you can pay for with Travel Credits.

Rewards

8\. To receive any type of Rewards, you must, when qualifying for and using the Credits:

*   have an Account with us
*   be at least 18 years old
*   meet the Individual Reward Criteria
*   not violate the Rewards & Wallet Terms, and
*   have a valid credit card, to qualify for Credit Card Cashback Rewards.

9\. When a Reward is available, the Individual Reward Criteria will explain how (and if) you can qualify for it. There may be:

*   time-sensitive restrictions (e.g. offers with expiry dates)
*   platform restrictions (e.g. promotional codes that can only be used in our app)
*   property restrictions (e.g. offers that can only be used with specific Service Providers)
*   a minimum spend (e.g. a Reward that you’ll only earn when you spend at least a certain amount on a Booking)
*   a maximum Reward value (for either monetary or non-monetary Rewards).

10\. Rewards cannot be sold, encumbered or transferred in any way to a third party. In the event of an Account holder’s death, their Account will be closed and their Rewards (if any) will be cancelled.

Credits

11\. You can put either Cash Credits or Travel Credits towards the cost of an eligible Travel Experience on a participating Platform (e.g. www.booking.com or a Group Company website).

12\. If that Travel Experience costs less than you have in Credits, your unused Credits will remain available in your Wallet.

13\. If that Travel Experience costs more than you have in Credits, you must make up the rest of the cost in time, using another accepted Payment Method - or your purchase will be cancelled, and your Credits returned to your Wallet.

14\. If you have various Credits with more than one expiration date, the Credits with the earliest expiration date will be used first.

15\. If you cancel a Travel Experience that you’ve paid for (in part or in full) with Credits, the Service Provider’s cancellation policy will determine whether or not your money and/or Credits are refunded. Our Customer Service team will be able to refund any Credits that you may be entitled to.

16\. You can cash out Cash Credits (but not Travel Credits) to a Payment Method.

17\. Your Wallet’s default currency is determined by your location, residency or another currency we may elect. If you get any Credits or Credit Card Cashbacks in another currency, we’ll convert them to your default currency, or another currency we may elect, using our Currency Conversion Rate.

18\. If a Reward was issued because you booked a Travel Experience, any associated Credits that haven’t been used will be deleted from your Wallet if that Travel Experience is cancelled.

19\. We reserve the right to cancel any Reward that was obtained by fraud.

20\. If you think you’ve not received a Reward that you should have, please contact our Customer Service team no more than 12 months after you did whatever it was that you believe qualified you for it. Please provide any supporting documentation you have. If you don’t do this within 12 months, you won’t be able to claim the Reward.

21\. All Credits have an expiration date, which you’ll find in the ‘Credits’ section of your Wallet.

Wallet

22\. All data, including personal data, will be processed in accordance with our privacy policy and applicable data protection laws and regulations. It will be shared with Group Companies or Service Providers as required by the Wallet programme. Lost, stolen or expired Rewards will not be replaced.

23\. Your obligations:

*   You’re responsible for making sure that all information is (and stays) correct, complete and up to date
*   If we ask you for proof of ID, please provide it within 30 days
*   You’re responsible for keeping your Wallet sign-in details safe and secure.

24\. If you don’t adhere to the rules in this section, we may automatically suspend or cancel your Wallet.

25\. You may not use your Wallet or Rewards in any way that is misleading, unfair or harmful.

26\. We may set off/settle any or all of your Credits against any claim we (or a Group Company) have against you. We may do this at any time, and without advance notice.

27\. We may change, suspend or end any aspect of the Wallet, Rewards and Credits. In particular, we might change:

*   these Rewards & Wallet terms
*   which users we allow to have a Wallet
*   which Rewards or Credits we provide
*   the expiration dates of any Rewards or Credits
*   any Individual Reward Criteria.

28\. We will make reasonable efforts to give you prior notice if we make any changes or stop providing Wallets altogether.

29\. If we stop providing Wallets, all Credits and Rewards that haven’t expired will be valid for another 12 months.

A14. Intellectual property rights

1\. Unless otherwise stated, all rights in our Platform (technology, content, trademarks, look & feel, etc.) are owned by Booking.com (or its licensors) and by using our Platform you agree to do so for its intended purpose only and respecting the conditions set out below in paragraphs A14.2 and A14.3.

2\. You’re not allowed to monitor, copy, scrape/crawl, download, reproduce or otherwise use anything on our Platform for any commercial purpose without written permission of Booking.com or its licensors.

3\. We keep a close eye on every visit to our Platform, and we’ll block anyone (and any automated system) we suspect of:

*   conducting an unreasonable amount of searches
*   using any device or software to gather prices or other information
*   doing anything that places undue stress on our Platform.

4\. By uploading any picture to our Platform (with a review, for example), you’re confirming that it complies with [our criteria](https://secure.booking.com/reviews_guidelines.en-gb.html?) and that:

*   it’s truthful (you haven’t altered the picture, for example, or uploaded a picture of a different property)
*   it doesn’t contain any viruses
*   you’re allowed to share it with us
*   we’re allowed to use it on our platform and in relation to further commercial purposes (including in a promotional context), everywhere, forever (when you let us know we can no longer use it we will consider any such reasonable request)
*   it doesn’t infringe the privacy rights of other people
*   you accept full responsibility for any legal claims against Booking.com related to it.

5\. Just to make it clear: we’re not responsible and liable for any picture uploaded to our Platform, we’re allowed to remove any picture upon our discretion (for instance, if we detect that a picture does not meet the above criteria).

A15. What if something goes wrong?

1\. If you have a query or complaint, please contact our Customer Service team. You can do this by accessing your Booking, or through our app, or through our Help Centre (where you’ll also find some useful FAQs). You can help us help you as quickly as possible - by providing:

*   your Booking confirmation number, your contact details, your PIN code (if you have one) and the email address you used when you made your Booking
*   a summary of the issue, including how you’d like us to help you
*   any supporting documents (bank statement, pictures, receipts, etc.)

2\. All queries and complaints are recorded, and the most urgent ones are treated as highest priority.

3\. If you're a resident of the European Economic Area and you’re not happy with the way we handle your complaint, you may be able to complain via the European Commission's ODR (Online Dispute Resolution) platform ([ec.europa.eu/odr](https://ec.europa.eu/odr)). It depends on what your complaint was about:

*   if it was about an accommodation, flight or attraction, you can use that ODR platform
*   if it was about ground transport, you can’t (because ground transport is booked with Booking.com Transport Limited, and the UK has left the EU).

4\. If you’re a resident of the Czech Republic and you’re not happy with the way we handle your complaint, you can complain to the Czech Trade Inspection Authority - Central Inspectorate, ADR Department, registered office Štěpánská 15, Prague 2, postal code: 120 00, email: adr@coi.cz, [https://www.coi.cz/informace-o-adr/](https://www.coi.cz/informace-o-adr).

5\. If you’re a resident of Brazil and you're not happy with the way we handle your complaint, you can complain via the Brazilian Federal Consumer Dispute Resolution Platform ([consumidor.gov.br/](https://www.consumidor.gov.br/)).

6\. We do try to resolve disputes internally, and we’re not obliged to submit to any alternative dispute resolution procedures handled by independent providers.

A16. Communication with the Service Provider

1\. We may help you communicate with your Service Provider, but we can’t guarantee that they’ll read anything from you, or that they’ll do what you ask. In itself, the fact that you contact them, or that they contact you, doesn’t mean you have any grounds for legal action.

A17. Measures against unacceptable behaviour

1\. We have the right to stop you making any Bookings, to cancel any Bookings you’ve already made, and/or to stop you using our Platform, our Customer Service, and/or your Account. Of course, we’ll only do this if, in our opinion, there’s a good reason to - for example:

*   fraud or abuse
*   non-compliance with [Our values](https://secure.booking.com/trust-and-safety/values.en-gb.html?), or with applicable laws or regulations
*   inappropriate or unlawful behaviour (e.g. violence, threats or invasion of privacy) in relation to us, any of the companies we work with – or anyone else, for that matter.

2\. If we cancel a Booking as a result, you won’t be entitled to a refund. We may tell you why we've cancelled your Booking, unless telling you would (a) contravene applicable laws and/or (b) prevent or obstruct the detection or prevention of fraud or other illegal activities. If you believe we have incorrectly cancelled your Booking, please contact our Customer Service team.

A18. Limitation of liability

1\. To the extent permitted by mandatory consumer law, we’ll only be liable for costs you incur as a direct result of a failure on our behalf. This means, to the extent permitted by law, we won’t be liable for (e.g.) any:

*   indirect loss or indirect damage
*   inaccurate information about a Service Provider
*   product, service or action of a Service Provider or other business partner
*   mistake in an email address, phone number or credit card number (unless it’s our fault)
*   force majeure or event beyond our control.

2\. If you are in breach of these Terms and/or the Service Provider’s terms, to the extent permitted by law:

*   we won’t be liable for any costs you incur as a result, and
*   you won’t be entitled to any refund.

3\. To the extent permitted by law, the most that we, or any Service Provider, will be liable for (whether for one event or a series of connected events) is the cost of your Booking, as set out in your confirmation email.

4\. Nothing in these terms will limit our (or the Service Provider’s) liability in respect of our (or their) own (i) negligence that leads to death or personal injury or (ii) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.

5\. We don’t make any promises about Service Providers’ products and services (apart from what we expressly state in these Terms). Making the right choice(s) is entirely your responsibility.

6\. Just to make it clear: nothing in these Terms will entitle any third party other than the Service Provider to anything.

7\. You may be protected by mandatory consumer protection laws and regulations, which guarantee you rights that no company’s terms can overrule. In that case, our liability is determined not just by these Terms, but also by any applicable consumer protection laws and regulations.

A19. Applicable law and forum

1\. To the extent permitted by mandatory local (consumer) law, these Terms and our services will be governed by Dutch law (for accommodations, flights or attractions) or English law (for car rentals and private/public transport).

2\. To the extent permitted by mandatory local (consumer) law, any dispute will exclusively be submitted to the competent courts in Amsterdam (for accommodations, flights or attractions) or England and Wales (for car rentals and private/public transport).

A20. Linked travel arrangements

1\. If:

*   after selecting and paying for one travel service, you book additional travel services for your trip or holiday during the same visit to the Platform; or
*   you book additional travel services for your trip or holiday via a link provided to you by us not later than 24 hours after receiving confirmation of your initial Booking with us,

you will NOT benefit from rights applying to packages under the [EU’s Directive (EU) 2015/2302](https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/nl-transposition-law-package-travel-directive_nl) or the [UK's Package Travel and Linked Travel Arrangements Regulations 2018](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/634/contents) (together, the ‘Package Travel Requirements’). Therefore, we will not be responsible for the proper performance of those travel services. In case of problems, please contact the relevant Service Provider.

2\. In either of these cases, the travel services will become part of a linked travel arrangement and not a package. In that case Booking.com has, as required by EU and UK law, protection in place to refund your payments to Booking.com for services not performed because of Booking.com's insolvency. Please note that this does not provide a refund in the event of the insolvency of the relevant Service Provider.

3\. Booking.com has voluntarily extended this insolvency protection to customers outside of the EU and UK who have booked multiple travel services via Booking.com that constitute Linked Travel Arrangements within the meaning of the Package Travel Requirements. This extension only applies to payments received by Booking.com.

4\. Booking.com has taken out insolvency protection by way of a bank guarantee with Deutsche Bank administered by Sedgwick International UK for any monies paid directly to Booking.com.

5\. Travellers may contact Sedgwick International UK (60 Fenchurch Street, London EC3M 4AD, the United Kingdom, tel. +44 207 530 0600, email: helpline@uk.sedgwick.com) if the services are denied because of Booking.com's insolvency.

6\. Note: This insolvency protection does not cover contracts with parties other than Booking.com, which can be performed despite Booking.com's insolvency.

7\. Please see Directive (EU) 2015/2302 as transposed into national law [in the European Union](https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/nl-transposition-law-package-travel-directive_nl) or [in the United Kingdom](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/634/contents).

B. Accommodations
-----------------

*   [B1. Scope of this section](#nov2021_terms_accommodations_scope_subheading)
*   [B2. Contractual relationship](#nov2021_terms_accommodations_contract_subheading)
*   [B3. What we will do](#nov2021_terms_accommodations_we_subheading)
*   [B4. What you need to do](#nov2021_terms_accommodations_you_subheading)
*   [B5. Price and payment](#nov2021_terms_accommodations_price_subheading)
*   [B6. Amendments, cancellations and refunds](#nov2021_terms_accommodations_amendments_subheading)
*   [B7. What else do you need to know?](#nov2021_terms_accommodations_know_subheading)

B1. Scope of this section

1\. This section contains the specific terms for Accommodations products and services.

B2. Contractual relationship

1\. When you make a Booking, it’s directly with the Service Provider. We’re not a ‘contractual party’ to your Booking.

2\. Booking.com B.V. owns and operates the Platform.

3\. Our Platform only shows Accommodations that have a commercial relationship with us, and it doesn’t necessarily show all their products or services.

4\. Information about Service Providers (e.g. facilities, house rules and sustainability measures) and their Travel Experiences (e.g. prices, availability and cancellation policies) is based on what they provide to us. They’re responsible for making sure it’s accurate and up to date.

B3. What we will do

1\. We provide the Platform on which Service Providers can promote and sell their Accommodations – and you can search for, compare and book them.

2\. Once you’ve booked your Accommodation, we will provide you and the Service Provider with details of your Booking, including the names of the guest(s).

3\. Depending on the terms of your Booking, we may be able to help you change or cancel it if you wish to.

B4. What you need to do

1\. Fill in all your contact details correctly, so we and/or the Service Provider can provide you with information about your Booking and, if necessary, contact you.

2\. Read these Terms and the terms displayed during the booking process carefully.

3\. Take care of the Accommodation and its furniture, fixtures, electronics and other contents, and leave things in the same state they were when you got there. If anything is broken, damaged or lost, make sure you report it to the staff there (as soon as you can, and certainly before you check out).

4\. Maintain the security of the Accommodation and its contents during your stay. So don’t, for example, leave doors or windows unlocked.

B5. Price and payment

1\. See ‘Prices’ (A6) and ‘Payment’ (A7) above.

B6. Amendments, cancellations and refunds

1\. See ‘Policies’ (A8) above.

B7. What else do you need to know?

We Price Match

1\. We want you to get the best possible price every time. If, after you've booked your Accommodation with us, you find the same Accommodation (with the same conditions) for less on another website, we promise to refund the difference, subject to the [We Price Match](https://www.booking.com/general.en-gb.html?&tmpl=doc/rate_guarantee) terms and conditions.

Partner offer

2\. Some offers on our Platform are marked as 'Partner offers', which means they come to us through a Booking.com partner company, rather than straight from a Service Provider. Unless otherwise indicated, any Partner offer that you reserve:

*   Must be paid for at the time of booking
*   Can't be modified. However, if it offers free cancellation, you will be able to cancel it for free, as long as you do it in time.
*   Can't be combined with any other offers (promotions, incentives or rewards)
*   Can't be scored or reviewed on our Platform.

Price incentives by Booking.com

3\. Some of the price reductions you see are funded by us, not by the Service Provider. We simply pay some of the cost ourselves.

Damage policy

4\. When you’re booking, you may see that some Service Providers refer to a ‘damage policy’. This means that if anyone in your group loses or damages anything:

*   you should inform the Service Provider
*   instead of charging you for it directly, the Service Provider will have 14 days to submit a damage payment request through our Platform, under your reservation number
*   if they do, we’ll tell you, so you can tell us if you have any comments, and whether or not you agree with the charge - and then:
    *   if you agree, we’ll charge you on their behalf
    *   if you disagree, we’ll look into it and decide whether or not to discuss it further\*.

5\. There’s a limit (which is shown while you’re booking) to how much the Service Provider can charge you under the damage policy through our Platform.

6\. Any payment you make would be between the Service Provider and you – we’d just be organising it on the Service Provider’s behalf.

7\. The damage policy doesn’t relate to general cleaning, ordinary wear and tear, any crimes (such as theft), or any non-physical ‘damages’ (e.g. fines for smoking or bringing pets).

8\. The Service Provider might require a ‘damage deposit’ before or at check-in. If they do, we’ll tell you about it while you’re booking – but it has nothing to do with the ‘damage policy’. We won’t be involved in any financial settlement related to damage deposits.

\* If there is any damage, the Service Provider can always decide to initiate a (legal) claim against you outside of the damage policy, in which case the limit (see 5 above) wouldn’t apply.

C2. Contractual relationship

C3. What we will do

1\. We provide the Platform on which Service Providers and (from time to time) Third-Party Aggregators can promote and sell Travel Experiences – and you can search for, compare and book them.

2\. Once you’ve booked your Attraction, we’ll provide you and the Service Provider with details of the Booking; if the Service Provider needs more than your name, we’ll tell you at the time of booking.

3\. Depending on the terms of your Booking, we may be able to help you change or cancel it if you wish to.

C4. What you need to do

1\. You must fill in all your contact details correctly, so we and/or the Service Provider can provide you with information about your Booking and, if necessary, contact you.

D. Car rentals
--------------

*   [D1. Scope of this section](#nov2021_terms_cars_scope_subheading)
*   [D2. Contractual relationship](#nov2021_terms_cars_contract_subheading)
*   [D3. What we will do](#nov2021_terms_cars_we_subheading)
*   [D4. What you need to do](#nov2021_terms_cars_you_subheading)

*   [D6. Amendments, cancellations and refunds](#nov2021_terms_cars_amendments_subheading)
*   [D7. What else do you need to know?](#nov2021_terms_cars_know_subheading)

D1. Scope of this section

1\. This section contains the specific terms for Car Rental products and services.

D2. Contractual relationship

1\. When you book a Rental, your Booking is either (a) with us or (b) directly with the Service Provider. Either way:

*   our Terms govern the booking process; when we send you your Booking Confirmation, you’ll enter a contract with us
*   the Rental Agreement governs the Rental itself; when you sign this at the rental counter, you’ll enter a contract with the Service Provider (but you’ll see and accept the key terms of it while you’re booking your car).

2\. In most cases, you’ll get your Booking Confirmation as soon as you complete your Booking – but if the Service Provider doesn't confirm your Rental immediately, we won’t take payment or send you your Booking Confirmation until they’ve done so.

3\. If there’s any mismatch between these Terms and the Rental Agreement, the Rental Agreement will apply.

D3. What we will do

1\. We provide the Platform on which Service Providers can promote and sell their Travel Experiences – and you can search for, compare and book them.

2\. We don’t guarantee the precise make and model you’re booking (unless we expressly say so). The phrase ‘or similar’ means you could get a similar car (i.e. the same size, with the same kind of gearbox, etc.). So the car pictures are illustrative only.

3\. Once you’ve booked your Rental:

*   we’ll give the Service Provider the Booking details (e.g. the Main Driver's name and contact phone number)
*   we’ll provide you with Pick-up information (e.g. the Service Provider's contact details, and details of what you need to take with you).

D4. What you need to do

1\. You must provide all the information we need to arrange your Booking (contact details, Pick-up time, etc.).

2\. You must read and agree to comply with these Terms and the Rental Agreement - and acknowledge that if you breach them:

*   you might have to pay additional charges
*   your Booking might be cancelled
*   the counter staff might refuse to hand over the keys at the rental counter.

3\. You must check your Rental's specific requirements, as many details (driving licence requirements, security deposit size, paperwork needed, payment cards accepted, etc.) vary per Rental. So please make sure you carefully read:

*   these Terms
*   the key terms of the Rental Agreement, which you'll see while you’re booking, and
*   the Rental Agreement itself, which you'll receive at Pick-up.

4\. You must be at the rental counter by your Pick-up Time: if you’re late, the car may no longer be available, and you won’t be entitled to a refund. If you think you might be late, it's vital that you contact the Service Provider or us, even if it's because of a flight delay and you’ve provided your flight number.

5\. The key terms of your Rental tell you what the Main Driver needs at Pick-up. You must ensure that when they get to the rental counter, they bring everything they need (e.g. driving licence, any required ID, and a credit card in their own name, with enough available funds to cover the security deposit).

6\. You must make sure the Main Driver is both eligible and fit (in the Service Provider’s opinion) to drive the car.

7\. You must have all the documents (such as ID, voucher and driving licence) that you need at Pick-up.

8\. You must show the counter staff each driver's full, valid driving licence, which they must have held for at least 1 year (or longer, in many cases). If any driver has endorsements/points on their licence, please let us know as soon as possible, as the Service Provider may not allow them to drive.

9\. You must ensure that any driver with a driving licence issued in England, Scotland or Wales obtains a [licence 'check code'](https://www.gov.uk/view-driving-licence) no more than 21 days before Pick-up.

10\. You must ensure that every driver has their own International Driving Permit (if they need one) as well as their driving licence. Note that all drivers must carry their driving licence (and International Driving Permit, if they need one) at all times.

11\. You must ensure that every child has an appropriate child seat if they need one.

12\. You must, if anything goes wrong during your Rental (accident, breakdown, etc.):

*   contact the Service Provider
*   not authorise any repairs without the Service Provider's consent
*   keep all documentation (repair bills, police reports, etc.) to share with us / the Service Provider / an insurance company.

D5. Price and payment

1\. Booking.com Transport Limited is the merchant of record for your Booking. For details of our payment process, please see ‘Payment’ (A7) above.

Additional costs and fees

2\. In many cases, the Service Provider will charge a young driver fee for each driver under a certain age (e.g. 25). In some cases, they may charge a senior driver fee for each driver over a certain age (e.g. 65). When booking on our Platform, you must enter the Main Driver's age, so we can show you details of any age-related fee(s) – which you would pay at Pick-up.

3\. In many cases, the Service Provider will charge a one-way fee if you drop the car off at a different location. If you intend to do this, you need to enter the drop-off location while booking, so we can tell you if it’s possible, and show you details of any one-way fee – which you would pay at Pick-up.

4\. In many cases, the Service Provider will charge a cross-border fee for taking the car to a different country/state/island. If you intend to do this, it's vital you tell us and/or the Service Provider as soon as you can (it must be before Pick-up).

5\. The price of your Rental is calculated based on 24-hour units, so (e.g.) a 25-hour rental will cost as much as a 48-hour rental.

6\. If, after Pick-up, you decide you want to keep the car for longer, please contact the Service Provider. They'll tell you how much this would cost, and you'll enter a new contract with them directly. If you drop the car off late without agreeing this in advance, they may charge an additional fee as well.

Extras

7\. In some cases, you'll pay for any optional extras (child seats, GPS, winter tyres, etc.) when you book your car – in which case, you're guaranteed to get them at Pick-up.

8\. In other cases, you'll merely request any extras when you book your car – in which case:

*   you'll pay for them at Pick-up, and
*   the Service Provider doesn't guarantee they'll be available for you.

D6. Amendments, cancellations and refunds

1\. We go above and beyond our legal obligations. Even though local laws don’t require us to offer specific cancellation rights, we guarantee that we will honour our refunds policy if you cancel your Booking.

2\. The following ‘Cancellation and Amendments’ terms apply to all Bookings apart from:

*   Bookings with Dollar or Thrifty that were booked before 26 January 2021 (please check your rental terms)
*   Bookings that are labelled ‘non-refundable’ (you cannot amend a non-refundable Booking, and you won’t receive a refund if you cancel it).

Cancellations

3\. If you cancel:

*   MORE THAN 48 hours before your rental is due to start, you’ll receive a full refund.
*   LESS THAN 48 hours before, or while you’re at the rental counter, we’ll refund what you paid minus the cost of 3 days of your rental - so there won’t be any refund if your car was booked for 3 days or less.
*   AFTER your rental is due to start (or you just don’t turn up) you’ll receive no refund.

4\. The counter staff may refuse you the car if (for example):

*   You don’t arrive on time
*   You are not eligible to rent the car
*   You don’t have the documentation you need
*   The main driver doesn’t have a credit card in their own name, with enough available funds for the car’s security deposit.

If that happens, please call us from the rental counter to cancel your Booking, and you’ll receive a refund, minus the cost of 3 days of your rental. Otherwise, you won’t be entitled to a refund.

Amendments (changes to your Booking)

5\. You can make changes to your Booking anytime before you’re due to pick the car up.

6\. In most cases, the easiest way to do this is via our app - or our website (under ‘Manage Booking’).

7\. There is no administration fee for changing your Booking, but any changes you make may affect the rental price. Sometimes, the only way we can change a Booking is to cancel it and make another one, in which case we may charge you a cancellation fee on the rental company’s behalf.

8\. If changing your Booking would change the price or incur a cancellation fee, we will tell you in advance.

Changes made by us

9\. If we/the Service Provider need to change your Booking (e.g. if the Service Provider can’t provide the car), we’ll tell you as soon as we can. If you don't accept that change, you’ll be entitled to cancel and claim a full refund (no matter how close the start of your Rental is) but we will have no additional liability for any direct or indirect costs you may incur (e.g. hotel rooms or taxis).

D7. What else do you need to know?

General

1\. In all cases, drivers must be at least a minimum age to rent or drive a car. In some cases, they must also be below a maximum age. The limit(s) can vary by Service Provider, by location and by type of car.

2\. Only eligible drivers whose names appear on the Rental Agreement may drive the car.

3\. You must not take the car to a different country/state/island and/or drop it off at a different location without arranging this in advance.

Late Pick-up/early drop-off

4\. If you pick your car up later (please see D4.4 above) or drop it off earlier than agreed in your Booking Confirmation, the Service Provider will not refund you for the 'unused' time.

*   [E7. What else do you need to know?](#nov2021_terms_flights_know_subheading)

E1. Scope of this section

1\. This section contains the specific terms for Flights products and services.

E2. Contractual relationship

1\. Most Flights on our Platform are provided via a Third-Party Aggregator, which acts as an intermediary to the airline(s).

2\. When you make a Booking, it’s directly with the airline. We’re not a ‘contractual party’ to your Booking. When booking, you enter into (i) an Intermediation Contract with the Third-Party Aggregator (for the ticket) and (ii) a Contract of Carriage with the airline (for the Flight itself).

3\. If you book any extras (additional baggage, insurance, etc.), you’ll enter into a direct contract with the Third-Party Aggregator or another company. We will not be involved in this contract.

4\. We act solely as the Platform and are not involved in the Third-Party Terms. We are not responsible for your ticket or any extras you may buy and (to the fullest extent permitted by law) have no liability to you in relation to your Booking.

E3. What we will do

1\. We provide the Platform on which Service Providers can promote and sell their Travel Experiences and you can search for, compare and book them.

2\. Once you’ve booked your Flight, your Booking details (e.g. the names of the traveller(s)) will be provided to the Service Provider.

3\. Depending on the Contract of Carriage, we may be able to help you change or cancel your Booking if you wish to.

E4. What you need to do

1\. You must fill in all your contact details correctly, so we and/or the Service Provider can provide you with information about your Booking and, if necessary, contact you.

2\. You must read and agree to comply with our Terms and the Third-Party Terms (which will be displayed at checkout) – and acknowledge that breaching them may lead to additional charges and/or the cancellation of your Booking.

E5. Price and payment

1\. When you book a Flight, your payment will be organised by us, by the Third-Party Aggregator (or a party specified by them), or by a third party such as an airline. For details of how we organise payments (including the related rights and obligations) please see ‘Payment’ (A7) above.

E6. Amendments, cancellations and refunds

1\. You’ll find the cancellation policy in the Contract of Carriage, which is available while you’re booking your Flight.

2\. There may be a fee for changing or cancelling your Flight.

3\. Airlines reserve the right to reschedule or cancel flights at their discretion.

4\. Different tickets from the same airline may have different restrictions or include different services.

5\. If you have any questions about changes, cancellations or refunds, please contact our [Customer Service team](https://secure.booking.com/help).

E7. What else do you need to know?

Code share

1\. Some airlines have ‘code share’ agreements with other airlines. So you may buy your ticket from one airline (your ‘ticketing carrier’), but fly in a plane that’s owned by another airline (your ‘operating carrier’). In most cases like this, you will check in with your operating carrier – but please confirm this with your ticketing carrier ahead of time.

2\. While you’re booking your Flight, you’ll be informed if it’s a ‘code share’ Flight.

Airline prohibited practices

3\. Most airlines don’t allow people to buy tickets that include flights they don’t intend to use – for example, a round-trip ticket if the person doesn’t intend to use the return flight. For more examples, just enter "point-beyond ticketing", "hidden-city ticketing" or "back-to-back ticketing" into a search engine.

4\. When you purchase a Flight, you agree not to do this, and to indemnify us against any airline claims for any difference between the cost of your actual journey and the cost of the full journey specified on your ticket(s).

Use of flight segments

5\. Most airlines require customers to use their flights in order. So if you don’t take your first Flight, your airline may automatically cancel the rest of your itinerary.

6\. If your airline does allow you to ‘skip’ any Flights in your itinerary, please make sure you cancel the Flight(s) you don’t want, in line with the cancellation policy. Note that you may not be entitled to a full refund (or any refund) for these unused Flights.

One-way tickets

7\. If you buy two one-way tickets rather than a single round-trip ticket:

*   you’ll be making two separate Bookings, each with its own rules and policies
*   any changes to one Flight will not affect the other (for example, if your initial Flight is cancelled, you won’t be guaranteed a refund for your second Flight).

8\. If you’re travelling abroad, you may need to prove to the Check-in and/or Immigration staff that you have a return Flight (see ‘International travel’ below for more on passports, visas, etc).

Charges, taxes and fees

9\. Your fare will include any taxes and fees charged by an airline or government (except entry/exit fees - see ‘Entry/exit fees’ below). You may be responsible for dealing with any retroactive change in the tax rate.

Booking fee

10\. We don’t charge any booking fees - but the Third-Party Aggregator might, depending on which Flight you’ve chosen.

11\. If they do, the fee will be included in the price of your ticket.

Fees for baggage and other extras

12\. Your airline may charge for checked baggage, excess/overweight baggage, priority boarding, allocated seating, onboard entertainment, food and drink and/or airport check-in.

13\. If they do, the charge(s) will be on top of the price of your ticket (unless it’s expressly stated that your Flight included the extra(s)).

International travel

14\. It’s your responsibility to:

*   carry a valid passport and/or visa if required
*   comply with any entry requirements
*   find out if you need a visa to pass through a country that isn’t your final destination
*   check with the relevant embassy in advance to see if there’s been any change in passport, visa or entry requirements
*   review any warnings or advice from your country of residence/origin before you go to/through a country or region.

15\. By arranging travel to or from any location, we are not guaranteeing that it is without risk – and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for any resulting damages or losses.

16\. It’s not a common practice, but international law allows ‘disinsection’ of aircraft to kill insects. To do this, personnel might spray the aircraft’s cabin with an aerosolised insecticide while passengers are on board, or treat its interior surfaces with a residual insecticide while they’re not on board. Before you travel, we advise you to find out about disinsection, including where it might happen.

Entry/exit fees

17\. Your fare will not include any fee that a country or airport charges people entering/leaving the country and that is collected directly at the airport. Before you travel, we advise you to find out if you’ll have to pay this kind of fee.

UK: Your financial protection

18\. **ATOL Holder:** Booking.com B.V.

19\. **ATOL Licence Number:** 11967

20\. Within the UK, we provide full financial protection for our ATOL protected flight only sales by way of our Air Travel Organiser's Licence number 11967, issued by the Civil Aviation Authority, Aviation House, Beehive Ringroad, West Sussex, RH6 0YR, UK, telephone +44 (0)333 103 6350, email claims@caa.co.uk.

21\. When you buy an ATOL protected flight from us you will receive an ATOL Certificate. This lists what is financially protected, where you can get information on what this means for you and who to contact if things go wrong.

22\. We, or the suppliers identified on your ATOL Certificate, will provide you with the services listed on the ATOL Certificate (or a suitable alternative). In some cases, where neither we nor the supplier are able to do so for reasons of insolvency, an alternative ATOL holder may provide you with the services you have bought or a suitable alternative (at no extra cost to you). You agree to accept that in those circumstances the alternative ATOL holder will perform those obligations and you agree to pay any money outstanding to be paid by you under your contract to that alternative ATOL holder. However, you also agree that in some cases it will not be possible to appoint an alternative ATOL holder, in which case you will be entitled to make a claim under the ATOL scheme (or your credit card issuer where applicable).

23\. If we, or the suppliers identified on your ATOL certificate, are unable to provide the services listed (or a suitable alternative, through an alternative ATOL holder or otherwise) for reasons of insolvency, the Trustees of the Air Travel Trust may make a payment to (or confer a benefit on) you under the ATOL scheme. You agree that in return for such a payment or benefit you assign absolutely to those Trustees any claims which you have or may have arising out of or relating to the non-provision of the services, including any claim against us, the travel agent (or your credit card issuer where applicable). You also agree that any such claims may be reassigned to another body, if that other body has paid sums you have claimed under the ATOL scheme.

EU: Passengers' rights under EU Regulation 261/2004

24\. If your flight is delayed or cancelled, or you’re denied boarding, you may be entitled to compensation/assistance under [EU Regulation 261/2004](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1476179175834&uri=CELEX:32004R0261) if:

*   You’re flying into the European Union (EU)
*   You’re flying out of the EU
*   Your Flight is provided by an EU airline

EU: Airline carrier liability under EU Regulation 889/2002

25\. If there’s an accident that happens within the EU, [EU Regulation 889/2002](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32002R0889) might apply to you.

EU: Rights of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility when travelling by air under EU Regulation 1107/2006

26\. [EU Regulation 1107/2006](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32006R1107&from=EN) provides for certain rights for people who are disabled or have reduced mobility.

*   [F7. What else do you need to know?](#nov2021_terms_rides_know_subheading)

F1. Scope of this section

1\. This section contains the specific terms for Private and Public Transport products and services.

F2. Contractual relationship

1\. When you pre-book Private or Public Transport, your Booking will be directly with the Service Provider. When you book an On-Demand Private Transport, your Booking will be with the Third-Party Aggregator. In all cases, our Terms will govern the booking process.

2\. **Pre-Booked Private Transport.** You and the Service Provider both agree to comply with these Terms.

3\. **Public Transport and On-Demand Private Transport.** You’ll be provided with the Service Provider’s terms during the booking process. If there is any mismatch between their terms and our Terms, their terms will apply.

4\. On-Demand Private Transport. By making a Booking, you are confirming that you:

*   have read and accept the Service Provider's terms
*   agree to contact the Service Provider directly about anything that goes wrong
*   understand that the Service Provider is responsible for arranging and providing your Private Transport, choosing routes, setting prices, and providing all relevant information
*   accept that we just provide a booking platform (known as an API service), and will not be liable for any loss you suffer because of anything the driver/Service Provider does or does not do.

Not all Service Providers have their own terms, but you’re welcome to check out [all the terms that we’ve been provided with](https://taxi.booking.com/information/terms/trip-providers).

F3. What we will do

1\. We provide the Platform on which Service Providers can promote and sell their Travel Experiences – and you can search for, compare and book them.

3\. **All Private Transport.** We’ll give you the Service Provider's contact details.

4\. **Pre-Booked Private Transport.** We’ll make sure the Service Provider knows what size of vehicle you’ve requested.

5\. **Public Transport.** We’ll give you (or tell you how to collect) your ticket(s).

F4. What you need to do

1\. You must check the details of your Booking carefully, and provide all the information we need to arrange your Booking (your requirements, contact details, etc.).

2\. You must make sure everyone in your group complies with our Terms and (where applicable) the Service Provider’s terms, which you saw and accepted during the booking process. You acknowledge that if you breach them:

*   you might have to pay additional charges
*   your Booking might be cancelled
*   your driver may refuse to transport you.

3\. You must bear in mind that estimated journey times don’t take traffic conditions into account.

4\. **All Private Transport.** You must make sure all passengers are at the pick-up location on time.

5\. **All Private Transport.** At and around your Pick-up Time, you must have the phone (whose number you entered when you made your Booking) switched on and able to receive calls/texts, in case the driver needs to contact you. We can't guarantee they’ll be able to reach you through messaging applications such as WhatsApp or Viber.

6\. **Pre-Booked Private Transport.** For any airport pick-up, you must give us your flight details at least 24 hours before your Pick-up Time, so your Service Provider can adjust the Pick-up Time if your flight is delayed. If they can’t provide a Private Transport following a flight delay or cancellation, please contact our Customer Service team.

7\. **Public Transport.** You must make sure all passengers arrive on time, leaving enough time to collect tickets if necessary.

8\. You must be 18 or older to make a Booking, and any passenger under 18 must be accompanied by a responsible adult.

9\. You must make sure no passenger behaves inappropriately - e.g. being abusive or doing anything that might endanger someone.

10\. You must make sure you choose Public/Private Transport that’s suitable (in terms of party size, amount of luggage, accessibility requirements, etc.).

F5. Price and payment

1\. Booking.com Transport Limited is the merchant of record for your Booking. For details of our payment process, please see ‘Payment’ (A7) above.

2\. **Pre-Booked Private Transport.** Price includes any tolls, congestion charges, taxes and peak surcharges. Payment is taken at the time of booking.

3\. **On-Demand Private Transport.** Price will be confirmed (and payment taken) when your driver drops you off. The price might be different from the price estimated when you booked. You are responsible for any tolls, congestion charges, taxes, peak surcharges and gratuities.

4\. **Public Transport.** Payment is taken when your Booking is confirmed. Before departure, the Service Provider may need to see your ticket(s)/e-ticket(s). Please keep it/them with you at all times, or you might have to pay again.

5\. The Service Provider/driver doesn’t have to agree to any changes to the Journey that you request in person. If they do, they may charge extra.

F6. Amendments, cancellations and refunds

Cancellation

1\. In most cases...

*   **Pre-Booked Private Transport.** You can cancel for free up to 24 hours before your Pick-Up Time (2 hours in some cases - please see your confirmation). If you don't cancel on time, you won't be entitled to a refund.
*   **On-Demand Private Transport.** You can cancel anytime before your Pick-Up Time, but the Service Provider may charge you a cancellation fee.
*   **Public Transport.** You probably won’t be entitled to a refund once your Booking is confirmed. If your plans change, please contact our Customer Service team to discuss any options that might be available.

2\. If your Service Provider has a different cancellation policy (which you’ll see while booking), their policy will apply instead.

3\. We and/or the Service Provider may cancel the Booking with little or no notice - but this would only happen in very specific situations. For example, if:

*   the Service Provider becomes insolvent or is genuinely unable to honour your Booking – in which case we'll do our best to arrange alternative transport (and we'll refund you in full if we can't)
*   you are in breach of these Terms and/or the Service Provider's terms – in which case you won't be entitled to any refund.

Amendments (changes) before your Journey begins

4\. **Pre-Booked Private Transport.** Your confirmation email will tell you how much notice you need to give (ahead of your Pick-up Time) to request any changes to your Booking (such as location or time).

5\. **On-Demand Private Transport.** To change your Booking, you may need to cancel it (which might incur a cancellation fee) and make a new one.

6\. **Public Transport.** You cannot change your Booking once it's confirmed.

7\. If we/the Service Provider need to change your Booking (for example, if there’s a strike that interferes with your journey), we’ll tell you as soon as we can. If you then decide to cancel:

*   **Any Transport.** Unless you cancel for one of the reasons in the next bullet, you’ll be entitled to a full refund (no matter how close your journey is).
*   **Any Private Transport.** If the change is simply a new driver, a new Service Provider, or a new (similar) vehicle, you won’t be entitled to a refund (unless you’re cancelling with enough notice).

Either way, neither we nor the Service Provider will be liable for any costs you may incur (e.g. alternative transport or hotel rooms).

Refunds

8\. If you wish to apply for a refund, you must do so in writing no more than 14 days after your Pick-up Time.

9\. Any refund may take up to 5 working days to arrive in your account.

10\. **All Private Transport.** If your driver isn’t at the pick-up location on time, you can apply for a refund, and we’ll investigate this for you.

11\. **All Private Transport.** You won't be entitled to a refund if your Journey doesn't go ahead as planned because:

*   the driver/Service Provider can't contact you
*   one or more passengers isn't at the pick-up location on time, and you haven't requested a new Pick-up Time
*   you request unreasonable changes to the Pick-up Time or Journey
*   you don’t tell us / the Service Provider / the driver about a change you want to make
*   you’d provided incorrect details when booking your Private Transport (pick-up location, contact details, number of people, amount of luggage, etc.)
*   of something that one or more passengers did/didn’t do.

F7. What else do you need to know?

Pre-Booked Private Transport

1\. Please check your confirmation email to see how long the driver will wait at the pick-up location.

On-Demand Private Transport

2\. The driver may not wait beyond the Pick-up Time - and if they do, they may charge you for the time spent waiting. If you aren’t at the pick-up location on time, you may be charged a cancellation fee.

Repair or cleaning charges

3\. If anything needs to be repaired or cleaned because someone in your group has done something unreasonable or is in breach of these terms, you will be responsible for the cost of repairs/cleaning.

By accessing, browsing and using our (mobile) website or any of our applications through whatever platform (hereafter collectively referred to as the "Platform") and/or by completing a reservation, you acknowledge and agree to have read, understood and agreed to the terms and conditions set out below (including the privacy statement).
    
    These pages, the content and infrastructure of these pages, and the online reservation service (including the facilitation of payment service) provided by us on these pages and through the website are owned, operated and provided by Booking.com B.V. and are provided for your personal, non-commercial (B2C) use only, subject to the terms and conditions set out below. The relationship that we have with the Trip Providers are governed by separate terms and conditions which govern the (B2B) commercial relationship we have with each of these Trip Providers. Each Trip Provider acts in a professional manner vis-à-vis Booking.com when making its product and/or service available on or through Booking.com (both for its business-to-business ("B2B") and/or business-to-consumer ("B2C") relationship). Please note that Trip Providers may have, declare applicable and/or require (acceptance of) – in addition to the policies and fine print as disclosed on the website, their own (delivery / shipping / carriage / usage) terms and conditions and house rules for the use, access and consummation of the Trip (which may include certain disclaimers and limitations of liability).
    
    Definitions
    -----------
    
    "Booking.com", "us", "we" or "our" means Booking.com B.V., a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, and having its registered address at Herengracht 597, 1017 CE, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. "Platform" means the (mobile) website and app on which the Trip Service is made available owned, controlled, managed, maintained and/or hosted by Booking.com. "Trip" means the various different travel products and services that can be ordered, acquired, purchased, bought, paid, rented, provided, reserved, combined or consummated by you from the Trip Provider.
    
    "Trip Provider" means the provider of accommodation (e.g. hotel, motel, apartment, bed & breakfast, landlord), attractions (e.g. (theme) parks, museums, sightseeing tours), transportation provider (e.g. car rentals, cruises, rail, airport rides, coach tours, transfers), tour operators, travel insurances, and any other travel or related product or service as from time to time available for Trip Reservation on the Platform (whether B2B or B2C).
    
    "Trip Service" means the online purchase, order, (facilitated) payment or reservation service as offered or enabled by Booking.com in respect of various products and services as from time to time made available by Trip Providers on the Platform.
    
    "Trip Reservation" means the order, purchase, payment, booking or reservation of a Trip.
    
    1\. Scope and nature of our Service
    -----------------------------------
    
    Through the Platform, we (Booking.com B.V. and its affiliate (distribution) partners) provide an online platform through which Trip Providers can advertise, market, sell, promote and/or offer (as applicable) their products and service for order, purchase, reservation, rent or hire, and through which relevant visitors of the Platform can discover, search, compare, and make an order, reservation, purchase or payment (i.e. the Trip Service). By using or utilising the Trip Service (e.g. by making a Trip Reservation through the Trip Service), you enter into a direct (legally binding) contractual relationship with the Trip Provider in which you make a reservation or purchase a product or service (as applicable). From the point at which you make your Trip Reservation, we act solely as an intermediary between you and the Trip Provider. We transmit the relevant details of your Trip Reservation to the relevant Trip Provider(s) and send you a confirmation email for and on behalf of the Trip Provider. Booking.com does not (re)sell, rent out, offer any (travel) product or service.
    
    For customers within the European Economic Area ("**EEA**"), Switzerland and the United Kingdom the following applies. Based on self-declaration, we request Trip Providers globally to indicate to us if they – in the context of EU consumer law – act as a private host (non-trader) rather than as a professional host (trader). If a Trip Provider indicates to us that it acts as a private host (or does not expressly indicate anything to us in this regard but based on information available to us cannot be clearly categorised as a professional host), such Trip Provider is labeled on the search result page as _"managed by a private host"_ and the following explanation is added:
    
    > _"This property is managed by a private host. EU consumer law relating to professional hosts might not apply. Hosts who have registered with Booking.com as a private host are parties that rent out their property or properties for purposes which are outside their trade, business, or profession. They are not officially traders (like a global hotel chain) and therefore may not fall under the same consumer protection rules under EU law, but don’t worry, Booking.com provides you with the same customer service as we do with any stay. This doesn’t mean that your stay or experience will be any different than booking with a professional host."_
    
    Trip Providers that are not labeled as private hosts on our Platform act – to our best knowledge – as a professional host under EU consumer law. The qualification as ‘private host’ is only relevant for the purpose of EU consumer law and has no relevance for tax purposes, including VAT or any other similar indirect taxes levied by reference to added value, or sales and/or consumption.
    
    When rendering our Trip Service, the information that we disclose is based on the information provided to us by Trip Providers. As such, the Trip Providers that market and promote their Trip on the Platform are given access to our systems and extranet through which they are fully responsible for updating all rates/fees/prices, availability, policies & conditions and other relevant information which is displayed on our Platform. Although we will use reasonable skill and care in performing our Trip Service, we will not verify if, and cannot guarantee that, all information is accurate, complete or correct, nor can we be held responsible for any errors (including manifest and typographical errors), any interruptions (whether due to any (temporary and/or partial) breakdown, repair, upgrade or maintenance of our Platform or otherwise), inaccurate, misleading or untrue information or non-delivery of information. Each Trip Provider remains responsible at all times for the accuracy, completeness and correctness of the (descriptive) information (including the rates/fees/prices, policies & conditions and availability) displayed on our Platform. Our Platform does not constitute and should not be regarded as a recommendation or endorsement of the quality, service level, qualification or (star) rating, type of accommodation of any Trip Provider (or its facilities, venue, vehicles, (main or ancillary) products or services) made available, save as explicitly indicated or set out otherwise.
    
    Our Trip Service is made available for personal and non-commercial use only. Therefore, you are not allowed to re-sell, deep-link, use, copy, monitor (e.g. spider, scrape), display, download or reproduce any content or information, software, reservations, tickets, products or services available on our Platform for any commercial or competitive activity or purpose.
    
    2\. Prices, We Price Match, and offers facilitated by a partner company
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    The prices as offered by the Trip Providers on our Platform are highly competitive. All prices for your Trip are displayed including VAT/sales tax and all other taxes (subject to change of such taxes) and fees, unless stated differently on our Platform or the confirmation email/ticket. Ticket prices are per person or group and subject to validity or expiration as indicated on the ticket, if applicable. Applicable fees and taxes (including tourist/city tax) may be charged by the Trip Provider in the event of a no-show or cancellation.
    
    Sometimes cheaper rates are available on our Platform for a specific stay, product or service, however, these rates made available by Trip Providers may carry special restrictions and conditions, for example non-cancelable and non-refundable. Please check the relevant product, service and reservation conditions and details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation.
    
    We want you to pay the lowest price possible for your product and service of choice. Should you find your property of choice booked through the Platform, with the same Trip conditions, at a lower rate on the Internet after you have made a reservation through us, we will match the difference between our rate and the lower rate under the terms and conditions of the [We Price Match](https://www.booking.com/general.en-gb.html?&tmpl=doc/rate_guarantee). Our We Price Match promise does not apply to non-accommodations related products and services.
    
    The currency converter is for information purposes only and should not be relied upon as accurate and real time; actual rates may vary.
    
    Obvious errors and mistakes (including misprints) are not binding.
    
    All special offers and promotions are marked as such. If they are not labelled as such, you cannot derive any rights in the event of obvious errors or mistakes.
    
    ### Partner offer
    
    Booking.com may display offers that are not directly sourced from Trip Providers, but are facilitated by a Booking.com partner company, such as another platform (Partner offer). Partner offers will be clearly displayed and distinguished from the regular offers directly sourced from Trip Providers and have the following special conditions, unless mentioned otherwise on our Platform:
    
    *   Price policy: as displayed on our Platform.
    *   Pay in advance: You’ll pay securely with Booking.com at the time of the booking.
    *   No modifications: Once your booking is completed, any changes to your personal or booking details will not be possible. Requests can be made directly with the property, but are not guaranteed.
    *   Cannot combine with other offers: Other promotions, incentives and rewards are not eligible on the booking.
    *   No guest review: It’s not possible to leave a guest review on our Platform.
    
    3\. Privacy and cookies
    -----------------------
    
    Booking.com respects your privacy. Please have a look at our [privacy and cookies policy](https://www.booking.com/general.en-gb.html?&tmpl=docs/privacy-policy) for further information.
    
    4\. Free of charge for consumers, only Trip Providers pay!
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    
    Unless indicated otherwise, our service is free of charge for consumers because, unlike many other parties, we will not charge you for our Trip Service or add any additional (reservation) fees to the rate. You will pay the Trip Provider the relevant amount as indicated in the Trip Reservation (plus - insofar not included in the price – relevant applicable taxes, levies and fees (if applicable)).
    
    Trip Providers pay a commission (being a small percentage of the product price (e.g. room price)) to Booking.com after the end user has consummated the service or product of the Trip Provider (e.g. after the guest has stayed at (and paid) the accommodation). Trip Providers can improve their ranking by increasing their commission (Visibility Booster). The use of the Visibility Booster (by increasing the commission in return for better position in the ranking) is at each Trip Provider's discretion and may be used from time to time and product to product offered. The algorithm of the ranking will take an increase in commission into account when determining the Default Ranking. Preferred partners pay a higher commission in return for a better position in the ranking.
    
    Only Trip Providers which have a commercial relationship with Booking.com (through an agreement) will be made available on Platform (for their B2B and/or B2C promotion of their product). Booking.com is not an open platform (like Amazon or eBay) where end users can make their product available (no C2C platform); Booking.com does not allow non-professional parties to offer or sell their products on or through Booking.com.
    
    5\. Credit card or bank transfer
    --------------------------------
    
    If applicable and available, certain Trip Providers offer the opportunity for Trip Reservations to be paid (wholly or partly and as required under the payment policy of the Trip Provider) to the Trip Provider during the Trip Reservation process by means of secure online payment (all to the extent offered and supported by your bank). For certain products and services, Booking.com facilitates (through third party payment processors) the payment of the relevant product or service (i.e. the payment facilitation service) for and on behalf of the Trip Provider (Booking.com never acts nor operates as the merchant of record). Payment is safely processed from your credit/debit card or bank account to the bank account of the accommodation provider through a third party payment processor. Any payment facilitated by us for and on behalf of, and transferred to the Trip Provider will in each case constitute a payment of (part of) the booking price by you of the relevant product or service in final settlement (bevrijdende betaling) of such (partial) due and payable price and you cannot reclaim such paid monies.
    
    For certain (non-refundable) rates or special offers, please note that Trip Providers may require that payment is made upfront by wire transfer (if available) or by credit card, and therefore your credit card may be pre-authorised or charged (sometimes without any option for refund) upon making the Trip Reservation. Please check the (reservation) details of your product or service of choice thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your Trip Reservation. You will not hold Booking.com liable or responsible for any (authorized, (allegedly) unauthorized or wrong) charge by the Trip Provider and not (re)claim any amount for any valid or authorized charge by the Trip Provider (including for pre-paid rates, no-show and chargeable cancellation) of your credit card.
    
    In the event of credit card fraud or unauthorised use of your credit card by third parties, most banks and credit card companies bear the risk and cover all the charges resulting from such fraud or misuse, which may sometimes be subject to a deductible (usually set at EUR 50 (or the equivalent in your local currency)). In the event that your credit card company or bank charges the deductible from you because of unauthorised transactions resulting from a reservation made on our Platform, we will pay you this deductible, up to an aggregate amount of EUR 50 (or the equivalent in your local currency). In order to indemnify you, please make sure that you report this fraud to your credit card provider (in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures) and contact us immediately. Please provide us with evidence of the charged deductible (e.g. policy of the credit card company). This indemnification only applies to credit card reservations made using Booking.com's secure server and the unauthorised use of your credit card resulted through our default or negligence and through no fault of your own while using the secure server.
    
    6\. Pre-payment, cancellation, no-show and fine print
    -----------------------------------------------------
    
    By making a Trip Reservation with a Trip Provider, you accept and agree to the relevant cancellation and no-show policy of that Trip Provider, and to any additional (delivery) terms and conditions of the Trip Provider that may apply to your Trip (including the fine print of the Trip Provider made available on our Platform and the relevant house rules of the Trip Provider), including for services rendered and/or products offered by the Trip Provider. The relevant (delivery/purchase/use/carrier) terms and conditions of a Trip Provider can be obtained with the relevant Trip Provider. The general cancellation and no-show policy of each Trip Provider is made available on our Platform on the Trip Provider information pages, during the reservation procedure and in the confirmation email or ticket (if applicable). Please note that certain rates, fees or special offers are not eligible for cancellation, refund or change. Applicable city/tourist tax may still be charged by the Trip Provider in the event of a no-show or charged cancellation. Please check the (reservation) details of your product or service of choice thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation. Please note that a Trip Reservation which requires down payment or (wholly or partly) prepayment may be cancelled (without a prior notice of default or warning) insofar the relevant (remaining) amount(s) cannot be collected in full on the relevant due or payment date in accordance with the relevant payment policy of the Trip Provider and the reservation. Cancellation and prepayment policies may vary per segment, product or service of each Trip.. Please carefully read the fine print (below the Trip types or at the bottom of each Trip Provider page on our Platform) and important information in your reservation confirmation for additional policies as may be applied by the Trip Provider (e.g. in respect of age requirement, security deposit, non-cancellation/additional supplements for group bookings, extra beds/no free breakfast, pets/cards accepted). Late payment, wrong bank, debit or credit card details, invalid credit/debit cards or insufficient funds are for your own risk and account and you shall not be entitled to any refund of any (non-refundable) prepaid amount unless the Trip Provider agrees or allows otherwise under its (pre)payment and cancellation policy.
    
    If you wish to review, adjust or cancel your Trip Reservation, please revert to the confirmation email and follow the instructions therein. Please note that you may be charged for your cancellation in accordance with the Trip Provider's cancellation, (pre)payment and no-show policy or not be entitled to any repayment of any (pre)paid amount. We recommend that you read the cancellation, (pre)payment and no-show policy of the accommodation provider carefully prior to making your reservation and remember to make further payments on time as may be required for the relevant reservation.
    
    If you have a late or delayed arrival on the check-in date or only arrive the next day, make sure to (timely/promptly) communicate this with the Trip Provider so they know when to expect you to avoid cancellation of your Trip (Reservation) or charge of the no-show fee. Our customer service department can help you if needed with informing the Trip Provider. Booking.com does not accept any liability or responsibility for the consequences of your delayed arrival or any cancellation or charged no-show fee by the Trip Provider.
    
    7\. (Further) correspondence and communication
    ----------------------------------------------
    
    By completing a Trip Reservation, you agree to receive (i) an email which we may send you shortly prior to your arrival date, giving you information on your destination and providing you with certain information and offers (including third party offers to the extent that you have actively opted in for this information) relevant to your Trip (Reservation) and destination, (ii) an email after arrival to rate the (experience with your) Trip Provider and the Trip Service, and (iii) an email which we may send to you promptly after your stay inviting you to complete our guest review form. See our privacy and cookies policy for more information about how we may contact you.
    
    Booking.com disclaims any liability or responsibility for any communication by or with the Trip Provider on or through its platform. You cannot derive any rights from any request to, or communication with the Trip Provider or (any form of) acknowledgement of receipt of any communication or request. Booking.com cannot guarantee that any request or communication will be (duly and timely) received/read by, complied with, executed or accepted by the Trip Provider.
    
    In order to duly complete and secure your Trip Reservation, you need to use your correct email address. We are not responsible or liable for (and have no obligation to verify) any wrong or misspelled email address or inaccurate or wrong (mobile) phone number or credit card number.
    
    Any claim or complaint against Booking.com or in respect of the Trip Service must be promptly submitted, but in any event within 30 days after the scheduled day of consummation of the product or service (e.g. check out date). Any claim or complaint that is submitted after the 30 days period, may be rejected and the claimant shall forfeit its right to any (damage or cost) compensation.
    
    Due to the continuous update and adjustments of rates and availability, we strongly suggest to make screenshots when making a reservation to support your position (if needed).
    
    For consumers (in the European Economic Area): We advise you to first notify us of any complaints by contacting our Customer Service.

    8\. Ranking, preferred programme, stars and guest reviews
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    
    The default setting of the ranking of Suppliers on our Platform is 'Booking.com Recommends' (or any similar wording); this is the Default Ranking. Please note that the Default Ranking is created through a complex ever changing and evolving system (algorithm) that considers a multitude of criteria in order to match searchers and accommodations in an optimal way. The actual ranking will be different for each customer and for each search as there are many criteria included, for example the popularity of an accommodation premises among our visitors (e.g. guest reviews), customer service history (including the number and type of guest complaints), certain booking-related data (e.g. number of bookings, cancellations, conversion rate, overbookings, availability, etc.), the commission percentage paid by Suppliers, other benefits to us (f.e.) through commercial arrangements with strategic partners and the (past) browsing activities of a visitor. Please note that for convenience we also offer other ways to rank Suppliers. A customer can choose to rank for example an accommodation on the basis of lowest price first, review scores, accommodation type (etc.). A customer thus has full control on the presentation of the search results.
    
    Booking.com has identified the following parameters to be most closely correlated with you finding a suitable Trip Provider and thus prioritise such parameters in the algorithms (main parameters): your personal search history, the rate of ‘click-through’ from the search page to the hotel page ("CTR"), the number of bookings related to the number of visits to the Trip Provider page on the Platform ("Conversion"), gross (including cancellations) and net (excluding cancellations) bookings of a Trip Provider. Conversion and CTR may be affected by various (stand-alone) factors including review scores (both aggregated scores and components), availability, policies, (competitive) pricing, quality of content and certain features of the Trip Provider. The commission percentage paid by the Trip Provider or other benefits to us (e.g. through commercial arrangements with the Trip Provider or strategic partners) may also impact the default ranking, as well as the Trip Provider’s record on timely payment. The Trip Provider may also influence its ranking by participating in certain programmes - that may be updated from time to time - such as the Genius programme, deals, the Preferred Partner Programme and the visibility booster (the latter two involve the Trip Provider paying a higher commission to us).
    
    Accommodation's star rating displayed on Booking.com is not determined by Booking.com. The accommodation determines their star rating themselves or it is determined by an independent third party provider of (objective) star ratings. Deals are shown on the basis of the number of stars (low to high or high to low) that providers provide to Booking.com. Depending on the (local) regulations, the star classifications either are assigned by an (independent) third party, for example an (official) hotel rating organisation or are based on the opinion of the accommodation providers themselves, irrespective of objective criteria. Booking.com does not impose formal obligations on star ratings and does not review them. Overall, the star classification is a representation of how the accommodation compares to the legal requirements (if applicable) or, if not regulated, the sector or (customary) industry standards in terms of price, facilities and available services (these requirements and standards can vary between different countries and organisations).
    
    In order to make it easier for customers to find the right match to their travel preferences, Booking.com may assign a quality rating, that is determined by Booking.com and displayed as yellow tiles, to certain accommodations. In order to determine the comparable set, the quality rating is based on many (400+) features which can be divided over 5 major categories: (i) facilities/amenities/services offered by the accommodation on Booking.com, (ii) property configuration such as unit size, number of rooms and occupancy, (iii) number and quality of the photos uploaded by the accommodation, (iv) average guest review score as well as some subscores, for example cleanliness, as those are proven to be particularly helpful for customers in assessing the quality of certain accommodations and (v) anonymised and aggregated historical booking data (for example, to assess the star rating of booked accommodations). We use these multiple features to derive statistical patterns. Based on these inputs, a machine-learning based analysis is being conducted which results in a quality rating (between 1-5, displayed by using 1-5 yellow tiles next to the name of the property) being automatically calculated and awarded to the accommodation.
    
    Only customers who have stayed at the Accommodation will be invited by Booking.com to comment on their stay at the relevant accommodations and to provide a score for certain aspects of their stay or may receive a rating request during their stay. The completed guest review (including submitted rating during your stay) may be (a) uploaded onto the relevant Trip Provider's information page on our Platform for the sole purpose of informing (future) customers of your opinion of the service (level) and quality of the Trip Provider, and (b) (wholly or partly) used and placed by Booking.com at its sole discretion (e.g. for marketing, promotion, or improvement of our service) on our Platform or such social media platforms, newsletters, special promotions, apps, or other channels owned, hosted, used, or controlled by Booking.com and our business partners. In order to offer and maintain recent (and therefore relevant) reviews, reviews can only be submitted within a limited period of time (3 months) after a stay and each review will only be available for a limited period of time (up to 36 months) after posting. The default ranking of the reviews is by date of submission relative to a few additional criteria (such as language, reviews with comments), whereas a review of a customer who \[always\] submits comprehensive and detailed reviews (aka "Property Scout") may be ranked on top. You have the option to choose various different forms of ranking and filter (e.g. by audience, date, language, score). Booking.com does allow the Trip Provider to respond to a review. We reserve the right to adjust, refuse, or remove reviews at our sole discretion insofar it violates our review policy. Booking.com does not compensate or otherwise reward a customer for completing a review. The guest review form should be regarded as a survey and does not include any (further commercial) offers, invitations, or incentives whatsoever. Booking.com undertakes to use its best efforts to monitor and remove reviews that include obscenities or the mention of an individual’s name or reference to stolen goods.
    
    Booking.com will not accept reviews which include:
    
    *   Profanity, sexually explicit, hate speech, discriminatory, threats, violence
    *   Mention of full names, personal attack towards the staff
    *   Promoting illegal activities (e.g. drugs, prostitution)
    *   Sites, emails and addresses, phone numbers, cc details
    *   Politically sensitive comments
    
    Booking.com and the Trip Provider are each entitled to terminate their relationship for whatever reason (including in the event of breach of contract or (filing for) bankruptcy) with due observance of the relevant notice period as agreed between both parties.
