Kick Community Guidelines
=========================

**3.0- Updated 06/02/2025**

What are Community Guidelines
-----------------------------

At Kick, we aim to be a creator led platform. We support creators expressing themselves freely so they can stream entertaining and engaging content. To stay within the boundaries outlined in our Terms of Service we have developed these Community Guidelines which set out expectations while interacting with our service.

These Community Guidelines are primarily for the benefit of creators, however, moderators and chatters should fundamentally behave in line with these standards. Violations of these Community Guidelines are, by default, a violation of our Terms of Service and this can lead to streaming potentially harmful content.

We aim to create an environment where everyone can engage with our platform to suit their preferences and we encourage viewers to navigate away from any content or interactions which do not align with their personal values.

Moderator considerations
------------------------

Live streaming, by its nature, is unpredictable. While it's impossible to foresee every outcome, there are several key factors that can lead to adverse content unfolding.  
Our moderation team follows a structured approach to evaluating reported content, considering the full context, including the creator’s reasonable expectations, involvement and reaction alongside the potential risks and outcomes of streams. They carefully assess these factors to determine whether a violation of our Terms of Service has occurred and to what extent.

###### Full Context

Not all situations are the same, context can influence how content is perceived. There can be situations where a scenario can be accepted as true, however, different moderation decisions will result based on the full context of reported content. Whether a creator shows positive or negative intentions, plays minor or major involvement in an incident, their differing reactions to issues and the ranging severity of issues will all influence content moderation. Creators should consider their past issues, the tone of their stream and any external factors impacting their content.

###### Intent

The intent of a creator is difficult to assess, however, there are certain indicators that indicate whether streams are responsibly crafted, aiming for entertainment, education or positive engagement rather than sensationalism or exploitation. When evaluating whether content violates these Guidelines, moderators consider if harmful situations could have been reasonably anticipated.

###### Involvement

The level of a streamer’s involvement in harmful content can vary widely, ranging from negligence to direct engagement in toxic behaviour. For instance, allowing harmful content to be streamed unintentionally due to lack of oversight, constitutes negligence. On the other hand, being actively involved in the participation of content which contravenes these Guidelines is more severe.

###### Reaction

During a live stream, decisions made in the moment can contribute to or help mitigate harmful situations. Creators should make responsible choices while reacting as events unfold. In high risk situations, a prompt reaction may be the difference between preventing a problem, containing an issue or allowing it to escalate. Creators should remain vigilant and consider reactions to unexpected circumstances as quick responses, such as averting the camera, muting inappropriate audio or switching to a neutral screen, can help prevent or reduce streaming harmful material.

###### Outcome

The outcome of actions and output of content is considered when assessing content. Moderators assess what actually transpired and was freely displayed for consumption when considering whether there has been a breach of these Guidelines. Creators are responsible for the content they create and repeated violations can lead to more severe penalties.

###### Moderators Summary

Across all content themes there are various levels of risk which should be considered. By understanding and accounting for low, moderate and high risk levels, creators can help ensure their content remains in line with platform Guidelines. Proactive planning, research, responsible decision-making and quick reactions all contribute to assessment of reported content by moderators. Our team will consider a wide range of influential factors to understand the full context.

Guideline 1
-----------

### Sexual Conduct

We allow sexually suggestive expressions which are lighthearted but we will take action if content is unfiltered and becomes excessively erotic. Consenting adult creators may stream content with sexually suggestive themes provided it remains appropriate for their audience and does not include nudity, sexual acts or overly sexual elements.

Moderator's Summary

Content where sexual expression is displayed on your channel must be age-restricted with an 18+ label applied and streams where sexual themes are the primary focus must be placed in our Pools, Hot Tubs & Bikinis category.

Our moderation team may request adjustments to content and prompt adherence rather than blatant disregard will help avoid infractions.

We do not permit explicit sexual content such as prolonged or overly sexual movements. Display of private body parts including uncovered breasts with exposed nipples or intimate areas is prohibited. Creators should be mindful of camera angles and avoid close-ups of sensitive areas.

The use of pasties during body-art streams is allowed, provided the artwork is actively progressing. We permit links and banners to legal sites with sexual themes while streaming in the "Pools, Hot Tubs & Bikinis" category.

Guideline 2
-----------

### Pornography

There is no pornography allowed on Kick. We do not permit the creation, sharing or intentional display of pornographic material.

Moderator's Summary

Do not offer reward for performing sexual acts, such as sexually charged challenges, display of pornographic content, use of sex toys, prolonged genital touching, excessive sexual depictions and graphic representations.

Guideline 3
-----------

### Protection of Minors

Kick is fully committed to the protection of minors. We prohibit content that endangers or exploits children and our users must always respect the privacy and safety of minors. We have a strict, zero-tolerance policy against Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM).

Moderator's Summary

It is essential to ensure that your streams and interactions are free from any content which could be exploitative of minors or promotes child exploitation. This includes refraining from requesting, creating, sharing or distributing any inappropriate and illegal material. You should avoid engaging in any inappropriate behavior or discussions with minors and never request or share any personal or identifiable information of minors.

We understand that parents or legal guardians may wish to include their children in streams, responsible supervision should be exercised ensuring their child's participation is safe, appropriate and respectful.

We want to emphasize there can be real life severe consequences for any illegal activity involving minors and we will cooperate with law enforcement authorities and regulators, as required.

Guideline 4
-----------

### Hate-Speech

Our moderation approach is guided by the needs of our global audience and the regulatory standards we uphold. Most definitions of hate-speech involve planning, incitement and calls for action to commit violent acts which could lead to significant harm or loss of life and may target individuals or entire demographic groups.

Context is crucial in evaluating hate-speech. Words that may be acceptable in some situations can take on an entirely different meaning depending on the full context. Our aim is to take a considered approach to find balance between supporting free expression while ensuring we maintain a safe space for everyone.

Moderator's Summary

We are a creator led platform and value responsible freedom of expression. We consider the full context when assessing hate-speech reports including the intent, involvement, reaction and impact behind content. It is important to understand the broader and surrounding circumstances, especially in live streaming, as there are often unforeseen developments and real-time unpredictability.

We do not permit hate-speech against individuals or groups based on gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability or other demographic identifiers. This includes incitement of violence that could lead to physical harm or death. The intent behind provocative language is considered and it should never be to incite violence.  
We encourage creators to foster discussion, expression and creativity while being mindful of how their content might affect others.

Guideline 5
-----------

### Violence

While violence may be contextual and there can be varying degrees of impact, we do not permit content that depicts or incites abhorrent violence including significant harm, suffering or death. We further do not allow malicious trolling, harassment or brigading.

Moderator's Summary

Our moderation team carefully evaluates reports of violence by assessing the context including the intent, involvement, reaction and degree of severity. Actions that could be considered violent in certain circumstances may be acceptable with a different context, provided there is positive intent, all participants are willing and reasonable steps are taken to minimize harm and ensure safety. It’s crucial to ensure that any potentially violent content such as stunts are handled responsibly and with consideration. Where the outcome of streamed content displays excessive violence we will take action.

Clear displays of unwanted aggression which lead to or are likely to lead to harm are not tolerated and harassment of others is not allowed.

Illegal hunting practices or content showing unnecessary harm to animals is not permitted, however, we do allow streaming of legal hunting and cultural context is considered when assessing reports of violence involving animals.

We allow discussion of global topics and issues related to terrorism but you should always ensure your content remains legal and appropriate.

Other General Guidance
----------------------

###### Links

We do not permit links to any illegal websites.

###### Emotes

Guidance on emotes can be found [here](https://help.kick.com/en/articles/10162055-emote-guide). Emotes should not violate these Guidelines and channel owners are wholly responsible for their emotes and those created by their moderators.

###### Channel Responsibility

Channel owners have final responsibility for the content streamed on their channel. Creators banned from Kick appearing on their channels should be avoided. These situations will be assessed in line with moderator considerations regarding intent and involvement and banned creators should not be the primary focus of a stream.

Channel owners run the risk of having a more severe ban if a suspended creator is permitted to appear on their stream and breaks our Terms of Service.

###### Streams

Stream titles should abide by the standards set out in these Guidelines. Streams should be in the most accurate category to reflect the nature of the content being streamed. If content is only suitable for overage audiences then an 18+ label should be applied.

###### Categories

Creators streaming in age-restricted categories should take additional precautions.

During IRL streaming, follow local laws and regulations related to filming, trespassing and public behavior. Avoid causing significant disruptions to public order and be considerate of others, especially those who may not be familiar with live streaming. Refrain from filming sensitive or confidential activities. Avoid any actions that could result in the unnecessary involvement of emergency services, including pranks that cause panic or disruption. Be aware of the people around you and refrain from filming individuals who clearly do not want to be included in your stream. Steer clear of pranks that involve harmful, discriminatory, or racist content. Always plan stunts, events, and pranks carefully and safely, and remember that the behavior of your community reflects on you. If your audience becomes disruptive or offensive, such as through vulgar text-to-speech (TTS) behavior, take responsibility and turn off TTS to maintain a respectful environment.

While streaming in our Chat Roulette category it is important to understand that we do not permit any prolonged engagements with underage individuals who may be inadvertently encountered and we will take swift action following any discussion of a sexual nature. If you unexpectedly encounter a person who appears to be, or it would be reasonable to expect, is a minor then you must immediately skip through to the next engagement. Be mindful of sharing personally identifiable information of others as this could contravene our Guidelines related to doxxing.

###### Reporting

We prioritize safety for all members, which is why we have a 'Report' button easily accessible. This feature allows reporting of any behavior that violates our Terms of Service. If you encounter a user engaging in conduct that goes against the Guidelines we’ve set out, please don't hesitate to use the 'Report' button. Your reports are vital in alerting our moderation team to address such issues promptly. We take all reports seriously and investigate them thoroughly.

###### How We Apply Enforcement Action

Our enforcement actions may vary depending on the severity and frequency of the actions. Our primary goal is to work collaboratively with our creators to address and correct improper behaviors. We believe in reformative efforts whenever possible and where creators genuinely course correct.

We have a zero-tolerance policy for some behaviors and will not collaborate to find a resolution in certain severe circumstances.

Our enforcement actions may involve warnings in chat, via email or post-stream. To uphold safety standards we may also apply alterations, muting, revocation of privileges, added restrictions, content removal, temporary or indefinite account suspensions and in serious cases permanent account bans.

Our moderators may apply a more severe ban based on channel suspension history, including frequency and types of bans.

###### Appeals process

If your channel has been suspended for a breach of our Terms of Service and you wish to appeal the decision, then you can send an appeal to [appeals@kick.com](mailto:appeals@kick.com) for consideration of a reduced length of suspension or channel reactivation.

###### Cooperation with authorities

Kick engages with law enforcement and regulators to produce information we are legally obligated to provide whether as proactive notification or in response to a formal request.
