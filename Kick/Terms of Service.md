If more than one country meets that definition for you, then your country of citizenship or legal permanent residence shall be your Country of Residence, and if you have more than one country of citizenship or legal permanent residence, it shall be the country with which you most closely are associated by permanent or most frequent residence.

### 11.2 Informal Dispute Resolution.

Company wants to address your concerns without the need for a formal legal dispute. Before filing a claim against Company, you agree to try to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting [support@kick.com](mailto:support@kick.com). Similarly, if you have provided an email address to us as part of your Account registration, Company agrees to do the same. If a dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) days after the email noting the Dispute is sent, you or Company may initiate an arbitration proceeding as described below.

### 11.3 We Both Agree to Arbitrate

By agreeing to these Terms, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you and Company each and both agree to resolve any Disputes – including any Dispute concerning the enforceability, validity, scope or severability of this agreement to arbitrate – through final and binding arbitration as discussed herein.

### 11.4 Opt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate.

You may decline this agreement to arbitrate by contacting [support@kick.com](mailto:support@kick.com) within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms and stating that you (include your first and last name, and User name) decline this arbitration agreement. By opting out of the agreement to arbitrate, you will not be precluded from using the Service, but you and Company will not be permitted to invoke the mutual agreement to arbitrate to resolve Disputes under the terms otherwise provided herein.

### 11.5 Arbitration Procedures and Fees.

(a) If the parties are unable to resolve any Dispute pursuant to Section 11.2 above, the Dispute shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration (the “Rules”) of the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”) by a sole arbitrator in accordance with the Rules. An arbitration proceeding under this Section 11.5 shall be conducted in London, England, and shall be conducted in the English language. If your Country of Residence is the United States, this Section (Dispute Resolution and Agreement to Arbitrate on an Individual Basis) shall be construed under and be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act, notwithstanding any other choice of law set out in these Terms.

(b) Notwithstanding any language to the contrary in this Section 11.5, if a party seeks injunctive relief that would significantly impact other Users or damages of at least $1 Million as reasonably determined by either party, the parties agree that such arbitration will proceed on an individual basis (unless a party is an Australian User), but will be handled by a panel of three (3) arbitrators, wherein each party shall select one arbitrator and the two party-selected arbitrators shall select the third, who shall serve as chair of the arbitral panel. That chairperson shall be a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and with experience arbitrating or mediating disputes. In the event of disagreement as to whether the threshold for a three-arbitrator panel has been met, the sole arbitrator appointed in accordance with this Section shall make that determination. If the arbitrator determines a three-person panel is appropriate, the arbitrator may – if selected by either party or as the chair by the two party-selected arbitrators – participate in the arbitral panel. Except as and to the extent otherwise may be required by law, the arbitration proceeding and any award shall be confidential.

(c) The decision or award of the arbitrator(s) shall be in writing and is final and binding on both parties. The arbitration panel shall award the prevailing party its fees and costs in accordance with the Rules. The arbitration panel may only award damages as provided for under the terms of these Terms and in no event may punitive, consequential and special damages be awarded. In the event of any conflict between the Rules and any provision of these Terms, these Terms shall govern.

### 11.6 Arbitration Shall Proceed Individually

This Section 11.6 does not apply to Australian Users.  
Regardless of your County of Residence or the rules of a given arbitration forum, you and Company agree that the arbitration of any Dispute shall proceed on an individual basis, and neither you nor Company may bring a claim as a part of a class, group, collective, coordinated, consolidated or mass arbitration (each, a “Collective Arbitration”). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a claim to resolve any Dispute against Company will be deemed a Collective Arbitration if (a) two (2) or more similar claims for arbitration are filed concurrently by or on behalf of one or more claimants; and (b) counsel for the claimants are the same, share fees or coordinate across the arbitrations. “Concurrently” for purposes of this provision means that both arbitrations are pending (filed but not yet resolved) at the same time.

### 11.7 Class Action and Collective Arbitration Waiver.

This Section 11.7 does not apply to Australian Users.  
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER YOU NOR COMPANY SHALL BE ENTITLED TO CONSOLIDATE, JOIN OR COORDINATE DISPUTES BY OR AGAINST OTHER INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES, OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY COLLECTIVE ARBITRATION (AS DEFINED ABOVE) OR ARBITRATE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, INCLUDING AS A REPRESENTATIVE MEMBER OF A CLASS OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY OR OTHERWISE SEEK TO RECOVER FOR LOSSES INCURRED BY A THIRD PARTY. IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISPUTE (AS DEFINED ABOVE), ANY AND ALL SUCH RIGHTS ARE HEREBY EXPRESSLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVED. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, IN THE EVENT ALL OR ANY PORTION OF SECTION 11.6 OR SECTION 11.7 ARE FOUND TO BE INVALID OR LESS THAN FULLY ENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS SECTION MAY BE DEEMED VOID AND AS HAVING NO EFFECT UPON EITHER PARTY's ELECTION.
