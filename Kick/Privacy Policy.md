Welcome! We are Kick.com, a gaming livestreaming platform. Our goal is to create a creator-friendly streaming service for content creators.

This Privacy Notice explains how Kick, operated by Kick Streaming Pty Ltd, ("Kick", "Company", "we", "us" or "our") collects, uses, discloses, and otherwise processes personal information (as defined below) in connection with our websites and services and other websites we own and operate that link to this Privacy Notice, and the related content, platform, services, products, and other functionality offered on or through our services (collectively, the "Services").

4\. Third party data collection and online advertising
------------------------------------------------------

We may participate in interest-based advertising and use third party advertising companies to serve you targeted advertisements based on your browsing history. We permit third party online advertising networks, social media companies and other third party services to collect information about your use of our Services over time so that they may play or display ads on our Services, on other websites or services you may use, and on other devices you may use. Typically, though not always, the information used for interest-based advertising is collected through cookies and similar technology, which recognize the device you are using and collect information, including click stream information, browser type, time and date you visited the Services, AdID, precise geolocation and other information. We may share a common account identifier (such as a hashed email address or user ID) with our third party advertising partners to help identify you across devices. We and our third party partners use this information to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics and market research. We may also use services provided by third parties (such as social media platforms) to serve targeted ads to you and others on such platforms. We may do this by providing a hashed version of your email address or other information to the platform provider.

Please see the "Online ads and control over your information" section below, to learn how you can opt-out of interest-based advertising.

We may engage in the following:

* Social media platforms: We may display targeted advertising to you through social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and other social media platforms. These companies have interest-based advertising programs that allow us to direct advertisements to users who have shown interest in our Services while those users are on the social media platform, or to groups of other users who share similar traits, such as likely commercial interests and demographics. We may share a unique identifier, such as a user ID or hashed email address, with these platform providers or they may collect information from our website visitors through a first-party pixel, in order to direct targeted advertising to you or to a custom audience on the social media platform. These advertisements are governed by the privacy policies of those social media companies that provide them. If you do not wish to receive targeted ads on your social networks, you may be able to adjust your advertising preferences through your settings on those networks.
* Third party marketing partners:  We work with a variety of third party partners to provide advertising services. For example, we use Google Analytics to recognize you and link the devices you use when you visit our Services on your browser, log in to your account on our Services, or otherwise engage with us. We share a unique identifier, like a user ID or hashed email address, with Google to facilitate the service. Google Analytics allows us to better understand how our users interact with our Services and to tailor our advertisements and content to you. For information on how Google Analytics collects and processes data, as well as how you can control information sent to Google, review Google's website, "How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps" located at [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners). You can learn about Google Analytics' currently available opt-outs, including the Google Analytics Browser Ad-On here: [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

We may also utilize certain forms of display advertising and other advanced features through Google Analytics. These features enable us to use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third party cookies (such as the DoubleClick advertising cookie) or other third party cookies together to inform, optimize, and display ads based on your past visits to the Services. You may control your advertising preferences or opt-out of certain Google advertising products by visiting the Google Ads Preferences Manager, currently available at [https://google.com/ads/preferences](https://google.com/ads/preferences), or by visiting NAI's online resources at [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices).

cookies, please see our [Cookie Policy](https://kick.com/cookie-policy).

You should be aware that when you opt-out of receiving interest-based advertisements, this does not mean you will no longer see advertisements from us or on our Services. Rather, it means that the online ads that you do see from DAA program participants may not be based on your interests. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third parties' opt- out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs. In addition, third parties may still use cookies to collect information about your use of our Services, including for analytics and fraud prevention as well as any other purpose permitted under the DAA's Principles.

6\. Complaints
--------------

You can make a privacy complaint to us by contacting [privacy@kick.com](mailto:privacy@kick.com).

If you are not satisfied that your complaint has been resolved then you can request from us the contact information for the relevant local governing body regarding your complaint.

7\. Personal information of children
------------------------------------

Our Services are not directed to, and we do not intend to, or knowingly, collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of 13. If an individual is under the age of 13, they should not use our Services or otherwise provide us with any personal information either directly or by other means. If a child under the age of 13 has provided personal information to us, we encourage the child's parent or guardian to contact us to request that we remove the personal information from our systems. If we learn that any personal information we collect has been provided by a child under the age of 13, we will promptly delete that personal information.

8\. Data collection technologies used in our emails
---------------------------------------------------

Our emails may contain tracking pixels that identify if and when you have opened an email that we have sent you, how many times you have read it, and whether you have clicked on any links in that email. This helps us measure the effectiveness of our marketing email campaigns, make the emails we send to you more relevant to your interests, and understand if you have opened and read any important administrative emails we might send you.

Many popular email clients will allow you to block these pixels by disabling certain external images in emails. You can do this through the settings on your email client -- these generally give you the option of choosing whether emails will display "remote images", "remote content" or "images" by default.

Some browsers also give you the option of downloading and installing extensions that block pixels and other tracking technologies.

9\. Storage, security and international transfers of your personal information
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We store your personal information electronically.

Security. We have implemented reasonable precautions to protect the information we collect from loss and misuse and from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Please be aware that, despite taking every reasonable effort, no data security measures can ever guarantee security.

You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, logging off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your login credentials secret. To the extent permitted by law, we are not responsible for any loss, cost, liability or expense incurred by you should you fail to do any of these things.

* Legal Obligation. Where we are processing personal information based on a legal obligation, we generally will retain your personal information for the period of time necessary to fulfil the legal obligation.
* Legal claim. We may need to apply a "legal hold" that retains information beyond our typical retention period where we face threat of legal claim or intent to establish a claim. In that case, we will retain the information until the hold is removed, which typically means the claim or threat of claim has been resolved.

In all cases, in addition to the purposes and legal bases, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, as well as the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information.

We only process and retain your personal information as permitted under applicable law. For example, we will only process your information where we have established a lawful basis to do, as follows:

This may also include our [Terms of Use](https://kick.com/terms-of-service).
    
* Where we have a legitimate interest which we believe outweighs your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms: this applies to the following processing activities:
    
* When we communicate: to respond to your inquiries and, on some occasions, keep records in case of complaints or legal claims;
    
* when you use our Services: when you access and use our Services, we process technical and analytics data to see if and how our Services can be improved, so that we can offer you a better user experiences in the future;

* sharing personal information with other parties: to run our business efficiently and securely.
    
* We have your consent: wherever you clearly consent to the processing, for example when you sign up for our newsletters or events, request a demo, free trial or a download, or submit a survey. Here, your consent is implied, meaning that you consent by submitting a particular form. We also rely on your consent for using cookies and other technologies on our website and here you explicitly agree to these. Note that your default setting depends on your location (country), as the rules for using such technologies vary across jurisdictions.
    
* We are subject to a legal obligation: for any processing where we need to comply with laws and regulations related to bookkeeping, accounting, taxation and employment, for example for keeping records.
