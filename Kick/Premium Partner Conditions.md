Kick Partner Program (KPP) - Terms and Conditions
=================================================

By taking part in the KPP and by activating the KPP option in your dashboard, you agree to comply with the following terms and conditions (“**Terms**”). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not activate the KPP option in your dashboard. These terms and conditions form an agreement between you (“**you**” or “**Streamer**”) and Kick Streaming Pty Ltd (“**Company**”, “**Kick**”, “**Us**” or “**Our**”). The Kick Terms of Service (available [here](https://kick.com/terms-of-service)) (“**Terms of Service**”) form part of and are incorporated into these Terms by reference. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and the Terms of Service, these Terms prevail.

1\. **INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PUBLICITY RIGHTS**
--------------------------------------------------

* 1.1. Streamer acknowledges and agrees that the Company (or a related body corporate of the Company, as applicable) is and will be the sole and exclusive owner of all right, title and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in its trade marks, logos, trade dress, images or other material and other Company intellectual property (collectively the “**Company Materials**”); and (ii) all posts, streams, videos, recordings and other online content referring to, including or otherwise incorporating the Company Materials.
    
* 1.2. The Streamer hereby licenses and authorizes Kick to use his/her portrait, name (including real name, nickname on Kick.com, and in-game names), recordings, videos, image, likeness and any other streamer symbols in connection with the Streamer’s live streaming or content creation on Kick.com.
    
* 1.3. Unless otherwise provided, the Streamer shall be deemed to be the author of the information and content (such as text, picture, audio and video, performance etc.) originated by the Streamer when using Kick.com and/ or carrying out live streaming. However, the Streamer hereby grants an exclusive, perpetual, transferable, worldwide, license to Kick to all the intellectual property rights of the information and content aforementioned for publication, exhibition, display, distribution, assigning, reselling, sub-licensing, syndicating, monetizing, editing, recreating or uploading of such information on Kick.com or any other channels.
    
* 1.4. The licenses granted under clauses 1.2 and 1.3, are exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, transferable, and sublicensable by Kick to any party worldwide and such authorization shall survive the expiry or the termination of the Streamer’s participation in KPP, notwithstanding the reason for such termination. Kick shall not be required to pay any additional fees to the Streamer for such sub- licensing or alienation of the property in any other manner.
    
* 1.5. The Streamer shall not utilize any content provided by Kick or provided to Kick for any purposes other than as specified in these Terms and shall not sell or commercially exploit in any manner, any content received from Kick or provided to Kick.
    
* 1.6. In the event of the occurrence of any action that infringes Kick’s legitimate interest, including but not limited to copyrights and copyright-related rights, in the information in clauses 1.2 and 1.3, such as publication, spread, transmission or copying without authorization from Kick, Kick shall be entitled to protect its rights and interests and the Streamer must provide all assistance that Kick requests in relation to this.
    
* 1.7. The provisions of this clause 1 shall survive the termination, expiration, or non-renewal of the Streamer’s participation in KPP.
    

2\. **CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION**
--------------------------------

* 2.1. In this clause “Confidential Information” means any and all non-public information, whether in oral, written, graphic, electronic, or any other form, disclosed by Kick to the Streamer. Confidential Information may include, but is not limited to, all information relating to the amount, rate or calculation of any fees payable or paid to the Streamer under the KPP, business opportunities, advice, reports, models, algorithms, code, technical or non-technical data, formulas, patterns, compilations, programs, plans, devices, methods, techniques, drawings, processes, financial data, financial plans, product plans, lists of actual or potential customers or suppliers, software, product names, technologies as well as inventions (patentable or not), marketing material, logos, trademarks, source codes, other trade secrets of any form whatsoever and the medium on which they are stored.

2.2. You acknowledge and agree:

* 2.2.1. you shall not disclose, copy, modify or reproduce any Confidential Information of Kick without the prior written consent of Kick;
    
    * 2.2.2. to protect and safeguard such Confidential Information in all cases with at least the same levels of protection and security that you use to protect and safeguard your own confidential information, and with at least a reasonable degree of care under the circumstances;
        
    * 2.2.3. that compliance with this section is necessary to protect the business, goodwill, and Confidential Information of Kick, and that a breach of the same will cause irreparable and continual damage for which monetary damages may not be adequate.
        
* 2.3. If you breach or threaten to breach this section 2, Kick may: (i) seek temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief, or other legal or equitable relief, in order to prevent such damage and money, or other damages allowed by law.
    
* 2.4. The obligations under this section 2 shall survive termination, expiration or non-renewal of the Streamer’s participation in KPP.
    

3\. **DATA PROTECTION**
-----------------------

* 3.1. Streamer shall, at its own expense, ensure that it complies with, and assists Kick to comply with, the requirements of all legislation and regulatory requirements in force from time to time relating to the use, transfer or processing of personal data, including (without limitation) any data protection legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679). This clause is in addition to, and does not reduce, remove or replace, any of Streamer’s other obligations (whether arising under these Terms or any applicable law).

4\. **WITHHOLDING TAX**
-----------------------

* 4.1. The Streamer acknowledges and agrees that Kick shall withhold taxes from the fees payable to the Streamer where required by applicable law. Kick shall calculate the withholdings based on the information provided by the Streamer and the relevant tax regulations. The fee payable after any such withholdings shall constitute full payment and settlement of amounts due to the Streamer under the KPP.
    
* 4.2. The Streamer agrees to promptly provide Kick with any forms, documentation, or other information necessary for Kick to comply with its obligations under tax laws, including but not limited to any forms related to residency or tax status. Failure to provide such information may result in additional withholdings as required by law.
    

5\. **INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR & NON-EXCLUSIVITY**
------------------------------------------------

* 5.1. The Streamer is at all times acting and performing as an independent contractor. Nothing in these Terms, including any work, act, commission or omission by the Streamer, shall be construed to make or render the Streamer as an employee or agent of Kick. The Streamer will not have, and will not represent to any third party that it has, any authority to act on behalf of Kick.
* 5.2. These Terms do not constitute any form of agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer, principal-representative, or franchisor-franchisee relationship between the Streamer and Kick.
* 5.3. The Streamer acknowledges and agrees that these Terms do not establish an exclusive relationship between the Streamer and Kick. The Streamer shall retain the right to engage in streaming activities on other platforms or channels, provided that such activities do not conflict with these Terms. The Streamer may only multistream on other platforms when the multisstreaming toggle is enabled. It is a breach of these terms to multistream without enabling the multistream toggle. Please note that revenue will be calculated differently when multistreaming (which may result in a reduction of revenue) compared to revenue generated for streaming exclusively on kick.com.

6\. **TERMINATION AND SUSPENSION**
----------------------------------

* 6.1. Kick may terminate the Streamer’s participation in KPP with immediate effect and without prior notice if the Streamer:
    
    * 6.1.1. breaches these Terms;
        
    * 6.1.2. streams content that violates the Terms of Service (available [here](https://kick.com/terms-of-service)) or Kick’s Community Guidelines (available [here](https://kick.com/community-guidelines));
        
    * 6.1.3. makes, publishes, or communicates any statement (whether directly or indirectly) or otherwise represents Kick or Kick.com in any way that, in Kick’s sole discretion, Kick determines might damage Kick’s or Kick.com’s reputation or image, regardless of the platform or medium through which any such statement or representation is made;
        
    * 6.1.4. conducts any activity or commits any act that, in Kick’s sole discretion, Kick determines may interfere with the business interests of Kick or its related entities or which may be deemed illegal under any applicable laws; or
        
    * 6.1.5. for any reason (or no reason) in Kick’s sole discretion.
        
* 6.2. On termination of the Streamer’s participation in KPP for any reason or upon expiry or discontinuation of KPP, Streamer must immediately cease use of, and return or destroy, the Company Materials and Kick Confidential Information. The Streamer shall not retain any copies of the Company Materials and Kick Confidential Information in any format. Notwithstanding such return or destruction of the materials, documents, or copies of Company Materials and Kick Confidential Information, the Streamer shall continue to be bound by the obligations of confidentiality under these Terms in perpetuity.
    
* 6.3. Kick has the right to review the contents of the Streamer’s live streams and other content created by the Streamer and displayed on Kick.com. If the Streamer produces any content that is illegal in the jurisdiction in which it is filmed or that violates these Terms, Kick may (at its sole discretion):
    
* 6.3.1. suspend or ban the Streamer’s live streaming and/or account on Kick.com, either temporarily or permanently, and delete the content at issue; and
    
* 6.3.2. the Streamer will not be paid any fee for any time spent engaging in the foregoing.
