**1\. GENERAL SERVICES TERMS**

Except as otherwise provided in Section 1.8 or in other product-specific terms of services published on the Site, when You purchase or sell digital assets on the Site, You are not buying or selling such digital assets from or to The Exchange. The Exchange’s primary role is to act as an exchange that facilitates the trading of digital assets by matching orders between users.

We take reasonable measures to ensure the accuracy of the information on the Site; however, We do not guarantee the accuracy, suitability, reliability, completeness, performance and/or fitness for purpose of the content of any of the Service(s) or products available through the Site, and, to the extent permitted by law, will not be liable for any loss or damage that may arise directly or indirectly from the content on the Site, Your inability to access the Site, or any delay in or failure of the transmission or receipt of any instruction or notifications sent through the Site.

While We make reasonable efforts to ensure continuity and security of the Service(s), We are unable to completely foresee and eliminate all legal, technological, and other risks including but not limited to force majeure, virus, hacker attack, peak demand, volatility, heavy trading, systems upgrades or maintenance, system instability, flaws in third-party service, acts of government, third party actions, or other reasons that may result in service interruption, data loss or other loss or risk. You agree to and acknowledge the possibility of a discontinuity or disruption of the Service(s) and that, subject to these Terms, We will not be liable to You or any third party if You are unable to access Your Account(s) or use the Service(s). 

1.4 **Fees and Costs**: Fees may be incurred for certain Service(s) provided to You. You agree to pay the applicable fees in accordance with our fee schedule as published on the Site and as may be amended from time to time. We may change the fees for any Service(s) from time to time, at our sole discretion. Please see Section 10 for more information.

In order to access the Service(s), You must prepare and bear costs for the following:

* An internet-connected device capable of securely accessing the Site, including but not limited to a computer or other internet-connected terminal;
    
* Internet access, including but not limited to any equipment needed for such access; and
    
* Any other equipment, software, or assistance needed to securely access the Site and Service(s).
    

1.5 **Account Security**: We will never ask You to reveal any passwords or keyphrases, nor will We ask You to transmit any funds or digital assets (hereinafter “**Assets**”) to bank accounts or addresses that are not listed on our trading platform. Do not trust any discount or promotions-related information that is not accessed through the Site. To the extent permitted by law, We will not be responsible for any losses caused by transmitting Assets to bank accounts or digital asset addresses that are not listed on the Site. Please see Section 4 for more information.

1.6 **Service Changes**: You agree that We may change or suspend any or all of the Service(s) at any time. Please see Section 11 for more information.

1.7 **User Information**: We may, and in some instances are required by law to, investigate and determine the background and purpose behind Your use of the Service(s). You are required to provide comprehensive, up-to-date, and accurate information when requested by Us. You shall also keep Your contact information updated at all times and We will not be responsible or liable for Your failure to do so. If We have reasonable grounds to suspect that any information You provide is inaccurate, We may temporarily or permanently restrict Your access to some or all of the Service(s) provided by Us.  In the event that We temporarily or permanently restrict Your access to some or all of the Service(s), We will not be liable to You or any third party as a result of such restriction(s). 

1.8 **Our Role and Associated Order Allocation**:

1.8.1 We may use the Service(s) by trading our own corporate Assets from time to time, as a principal or on the behalf of a third party. Such activity may include, but is not limited to, buying or selling digital assets, placing orders to buy or sell digital assets, acting as a market maker for certain digital assets, and using the Service(s) on a proprietary basis. Orders submitted and trades executed by Us are not distinguished from other offers and trades on Our platform (i.e. if We use the Site to enter trades on our own behalf, Our trades will not be prioritized differently from the trades of other users).  We may thus act as a counterparty to any trade executed by You or other users of the Service(s), without Your knowledge.

1.8.2. We may learn of certain information that constitutes “insider information” as defined under certain laws or regulations. We do not disclose any such “insider information” to anyone and We do not use such “insider information” to trade in digital assets or attempt in any way to profit from any such information.

1.8.3 Our utilization of the Service(s) may lead to potential or actual conflicts of interest with other counterparties, including users. Such trading activity, as described in Clause 1.8.1, may include Us engaging in transactions with multiple counterparties, including users, where interests differ. We may at times hold positions or engage in transactions that are contrary to the interests of certain counterparties, including users. We have no fiduciary duty to You and do not undertake to act in any fiduciary capacity. 

1.9 **Limited Services Terms**: Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if You are directed to this Site through a third-party channel to complete certain transactions with credit cards, debit cards or local instant transfer methods, You agree and acknowledge that the services provided to You by Us are limited to those transactions, and that irrespective of any use of the words “purchase”, “sale” or similar terms, no full rights or privileges are granted to You under this Agreement. We have no control over, or liability for, the delivery, quality, safety, validity, legality or any other aspect of any goods, services or technology that You may purchase or obtain from a third party (hereafter the “**Third-Party Services**”). We are not responsible for ensuring that any third party You transact with will complete the Third-Party Services or is authorized to do so. Be aware that Third-Party Services may have separate costs and fees associated with the goods, services or technology they provide, which are independent from Our fees and are Your responsibility. If You experience a problem in relation to the Third-Party Services or if You have a dispute with such third party, You should resolve the dispute directly with that third party. You are fully responsible for all acts or omissions of any third party with respect to your Account(s). Further, You acknowledge and agree that You will not hold Us responsible for, and will indemnify Us from, any liability arising out of or related to any act or omission of any third party with access to Your Account(s).

**3\. RISK DISCLOSURE**

3.1 **Trading Risk**: Trading of digital assets involves significant risk. The risk of loss in trading or holding digital assets can be substantial. You should therefore carefully consider whether trading in digital assets (or any use of margin if permitted/enabled) is suitable for Your financial condition, risk tolerance, or investment objectives. 

You should exercise prudence when trading Your Assets. Prices may fluctuate at any moment. Due to such price fluctuations, Your Assets may increase or decrease in value at any given moment. Any digital asset or trading position may be subject to large swings in value and may even become worthless. Digital assets are not subject to any kind of deposit insurance or securities investors protection regimes.

3.2 **FX Conversion Risk:**  You agree and understand that any credit card payments you make using currency other than EURO will undergo a standardized FX conversion process. This FX conversion process may in some circumstances be subject to systemic errors and unexpected failures. In the event of such errors and/or systemic failures, as determined by us in our sole discretion, you may receive a balance in EURO or any other supported currency which may be different from the local currency balance you started with at the outset of your payment transaction. This might result in a risk of loss and you agree that you shall bear all costs related to any FX conversion risk resulting from such system errors and/or failure.

3.3 **Your Responsibilities**: You shall bear any loss as a result of Your actions, including, but not limited to:

* “Fat finger” input or instructions errors, including price, quantity, and/or timing (market vs. limit order specification) errors;
    
* Mistiming or mis-submission of trade instructions;
    
* Forgetting or disclosing Your password;
    
* Computer or network issues, including any hacks or virus issues related to Your computer or network (or the network You are utilizing);
    
* Transfer-in or withdrawal of digital assets or fiat currencies to or from the wrong account;
    
* Executing instructions provided to You by a third-party; or
    
* Third parties accessing and using Your account for any reason.
    

In the event of Your malicious, manipulative, or abusive use of the Service(s), a violation of these Terms of Service, and/or any other behaviors or methods utilized to gain an unfair advantage, as determined at our sole and absolute discretion, We may take necessary action, including, but not limited to, closing Your Account(s), placing restrictions on account transactions, freezing Assets in Your Account(s), restricting Your access to Your Account(s), commencing legal action against You and/or pursuing other measures of recourse. We may require You to bear all costs incurred as a result of any action taken by Us under this Section 3.3, including legal fees and costs. In addition, it is Your sole responsibility to ensure that all account information is verified before making any transfers so that digital assets or fiat currencies are transferred into the correct account. Digital assets or fiat currencies transferred to a wrong account are typically irreversible. If You transfer digital assets or fiat currencies to a wrong account and such account is controlled by Us, We will have the sole discretion to reject the transaction and return to You the relevant amount of digital assets or fiat currencies, less applicable fees. 

We take fraud and scams very seriously and work diligently to prevent them. However, We cannot be held responsible for any losses incurred by You as a result of engaging with fraudulent or scam companies outside of Our platform. It is Your responsibility to conduct Your own due diligence and exercise caution when dealing with third-party entities. We strongly recommend that You only purchase and transfer cryptocurrency to trusted and verified wallets. If You experience a loss from falling victim to a scam, We will cooperate with You and any relevant authorities to the best of Our ability. However, We cannot guarantee the recovery of any lost Assets, will not be liable for the value of any lost Assets, nor can we be held liable for any chargebacks resulting from such losses. By using Our platform, You acknowledge and agree to assume all risks associated with Your cryptocurrency purchases and transfers.

3.4 **Our Responsibilities for Credit Card Transactions**: Our obligation to You as the cardholder is to provide a reliable and efficient platform for purchasing and depositing cryptocurrencies. Any digital asset You purchase using Your credit card will be credited into Your account and Our obligation in this regard will be deemed complete when the digital asset amount purchased by You is delivered and reflected in Your account. We will not be responsible for any losses that may occur after that point. You are solely responsible for the management of these digital assets once credited.

**4\. YOUR ACCOUNT**

If You have 2-factor authentication (“**2FA**”) enabled via an authenticator app, You may also be asked to confirm Your 2FA code. If You need to reset both Your password and 2FA (e.g., lost 2FA app device or failed to migrate 2FA), You will need to contact support@okcoin.com for additional support and may be subject to enhanced identity verification procedures. These enhanced identity verification procedures are necessary to ensure the security of our users’ accounts. You agree to be subject to any enhanced identity verification procedures We deem necessary. Refusal of such procedures may render You unable to access Your Account(s).

4.4 **Account Closure**: You may close Your Account(s) at any time. Closing an account will not affect any rights and obligations incurred prior to the date of account closure.

4.5 **Account Suspension and Investigation**: You agree and acknowledge that We may suspend Your Account(s) at any time, in our sole and absolute discretion.

If there are any digital assets remaining in Your account, You agree to provide Us with a digital asset address held in Your name upon receiving written notice, so that We can return the remaining digital assets to You.

4.7 **Reversals and Cancellations**: You agree and understand that You cannot cancel, reverse, or change any transaction that has been marked as complete in Your Account(s).

* if We suspect the transaction involves (or has a high risk of involvement in) suspicious trading activity or violations of these Terms;
    
* if We have reason to believe there was an obvious error in any term, including but not limited to the price, amount or any other information about the trade;
    
* if there was disruption or malfunction in the operation of any trading system; or

4.8. **Right of Offset and Recoveries**: In the event that there are insufficient Assets in Your Account(s) due to a chargeback, payment dispute, wire recall, SEPA reversal, credit error or other similar occurrence, or Your Account(s) are subject to a Levy that We reasonably determine is valid in Our sole and absolute discretion, You expressly authorize us to freeze, debit, convert, withhold, and/or liquidate any current or future Assets from Your Account(s) to the extent necessary to offset or satisfy any insufficiencies or to satisfy the Levy, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. You acknowledge that You will be solely responsible for any and all tax consequences of any such action by Us. In the event that the disposition or liquidation of digital assets is inadequate to satisfy the insufficiencies, You agree that You will immediately deliver, in Euro (or the fiat currency relevant to Your jurisdiction, as applicable), the full amount necessary to alleviate the insufficiency or You will be liable to Us for the insufficiencies in addition to any attorney’s fees, interest or expense associated with its recovery. 

4.9. **Credit Reporting and Third-Party Collection Agencies**: You agree and acknowledge that, to the extent permitted under applicable law, We may use the services of external credit reporting agencies and third-party collection agencies in the recovery of any loss We incur from transactions and activities in Your Account(s).

**5\. TRANSFER-IN AND WITHDRAWAL**

For the purpose of these Terms, transfers-in and withdrawals will include transfer and withdrawal of either fiat currency or digital assets into/from Your Account(s).

5.1 **Fiat Currency**: We may provide users with various fiat transfer-in and withdrawal options from time to time based on their locations, including but not limited to wire, SEPA (or equivalent payment services), or indirect transfers to/from a Payment Service Provider (“**PSP**”) and/or any bank account(s) held by a PSP. The current fiat transfer-in and withdrawal options and fee schedule are available [here](https://support.okcoin.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026979331-Fiat-Deposit-Withdraw-Options). The amount You transfer-in to Your Account(s) may be on hold until after the transfer-in clears. The name on the bank account linked to Your transfer must match the name verified on Your account. 

For eligible users, SEPAtransfer-in may be made available for immediate use in Your account, and You will receive an email confirmation with transaction details upon authorizing any SEPA transactions. However, these funds and any digital assets bought with such funds may be subject to a withdrawal holdup period of up to thirty (30) business days or longer, based on Your risk profile, as determined at our sole and absolute discretion (“**Withdrawal Hold Period**”). Once Your SEPA Withdrawal Hold Period has been satisfied, You will be able to withdraw these funds and any digital assets purchased with them. In the case where an SEPA transfer-in is recalled or the associated funds are otherwise returned to Your bank account and the pre-credited funds have already been utilized, We will debit Your account with the same amount that was deposited. If this causes Your account balance to be negative, You will have to deliver funds or sell a certain portion or all of Your digital assets to bring Your account balance back to positive. If You fail to promptly do so after Your account goes negative, We may, at our sole and absolute discretion and subject to applicable law, avail ourselves of remedies set forth in these Terms to recover any amount You owe to Us, including but not limited to, debiting, converting, and/or liquidating Assets available in Your Account(s) at a market rate of exchange until such negative balance is recovered.

You agree and acknowledge that the above-mentioned transfer-in and withdrawal options may not be processed outside of normal banking hours, and settlement times may be subject to bank holidays, the internal processes and jurisdiction of your bank, the internal processes of our banks, or other delay resulting from factors outside of our reasonable control.
