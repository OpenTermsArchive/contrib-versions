### 2\. LAW ENFORCEMENT REQUESTS

We are responsible for processing law enforcement requests from all jurisdictions, in accordance with our Terms of Service, our Privacy Notice Statement, and any applicable laws and regulations.

If you are an authorized law enforcement officer, please address all law enforcement requests to “**OKX**” (as opposed to a specific OKX entity) and send such requests to [enforcement@okx.com](mailto: enforcement@okx.com) . We make every effort to promptly respond to your emails. If, however, you do not receive our response, please check your email's junk/spam folder.

If applicable, please also reference the appropriate applicable Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty-related documents if cross-border law enforcement is involved.

### 3\. REQUIRED INFORMATION

For us to consider your request, law enforcement officers should write to us:

1. using an email address from an official government domain and attaching documentary evidence of your personal authority as a representative of your law enforcement agency to administer such request (e.g. photo of your agent badge);
    
2. stating in the subject line the specific actions/items requested; and
    
3. attaching a signed court order and/or official letter from your law enforcement agency that includes the following details:

        * all relevant wallet address(es) and transaction hashes (“TXID”), starting from the first transaction the alleged victim is complaining about (please specify token type and amount for each transaction, and the relevant blockchain) (“First Transaction”), to how that transaction is traced to OKX;
            
        * for complex cases, please state the total amount in question (in tokens and approximate value in USD), and include a breakdown for our better understanding;

### 4\. CONFIDENTIALITY REQUEST

In the event your request requires a freeze of a customer's OKX account, we will not disclose to the affected customer that such action was taken pursuant to a request from your law enforcement agency. In certain circumstances, however, we may seek your approval to disclose to the customer that their account has been frozen pursuant to a directive from your agency. We will not make any such disclosures unless we get prior permission from you, although we may not be able to maintain the freeze on a voluntary basis for a prolonged period without such permission.

If such permission is granted, please also confirm whether we can share your official contact information with the affected customer so they can contact you directly to assist with your investigation.
