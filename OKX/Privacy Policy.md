We may transfer Personal Data that we maintain about you to recipients in countries other than the country in which the Personal Data was originally collected. Those other countries may have data protection or privacy rules that are different from those of your country. However, we will take measures to ensure that any such transfers comply with applicable data protection laws and that your Personal Data remains protected to the standards described in this Privacy Notice. In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies, or security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access your Personal Data. By communicating electronically with OKX, you acknowledge and agree to your Personal Data being processed in this way.

**Collection and Transfer of Data Outside of The EEA**

We comply with applicable laws to provide an adequate level of data protection for the transfer of your Personal Data to other countries outside of the EEA.

**9\. ACCESS, CORRECTION, AND DELETION OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA**
--------------------------------------------------------------

Subject to certain exceptions prescribed by applicable law, you have the right to obtain a copy of your Personal Data upon request and ascertain whether the information we hold about you is accurate and up-to-date. We will provide access within 30 days of your request. If we refuse to provide the information, we will provide reasons for the refusal. We will require identity verification and specification of what information is required before providing you with access. If any of your Personal Data is inaccurate, you may request to update your information. Where we are satisfied that the request to update the information is accurate, we will take reasonable steps to correct the information within 30 days, unless you agree otherwise.

In response to data access, correction, or deletion requests, we will verify the requesting party’s identity to ensure that they are legally entitled to make such request. While we aim to respond to these requests free of charge, we reserve the right to charge you a reasonable fee should your request be repetitive or onerous. Please note that you may not be able to continue receiving the Services, depending on the extent of your withdrawal of consent.

**10\. CHILDRENS’ PERSONAL DATA**
---------------------------------

OKX does not knowingly offer services to or collect the Personal Data of anyone under the age of 18. If we learn that we have collected Personal Data of anyone under the age of 18, we will promptly delete it from our systems. If you are aware of anyone under the age of 18 using our Services, please notify us so we can take prompt action to prevent access to our Services.

**11\. IDENTITY VERIFICATION AND BIOMETRIC DATA Privacy Notice**
----------------------------------------------------------------

To comply with applicable laws, regulations, and other legal obligations in the EEA and in other countries, including “know your customer” obligations, we require all users to verify their identity before using our Services. 

In order to verify a user’s identity for the use of certain Services, the user is asked to capture an image of their government ID (e.g., a passport or driver’s license) and take a real-time selfie image of their face. We provide those images to our identity verification service provider, who then uses a combination of machine learning tools and statistical algorithms to confirm the authenticity of the government ID and selfie image, and to perform biometric facial comparisons to determine whether the face contained in the government ID and selfie image belong to the same person. Through this process, the verification service provider will typically generate a confidence score representing the confidence level that the images of the individuals match, which we or the relevant service provider may use in determining the level of confidence that the individual submitting the selfie image is the same person as the individual on the government ID. 

We do not receive, store, or collect any facial biometric information generated by our third-party identity verification service provider from the images, and our identity verification service provider retains biometric information only as long as necessary for us to provide our Service to you and to help us comply with our legal obligations. We do not use, disclose, or retain facial biometric information for any other commercial purpose. However, we do retain the information and images you provide in connection with the identity verification process, along with the results of the identity check, as long as necessary to provide our service to you and to comply with our legal obligations. 

We currently use identity verification services provided by Jumio and Sumsub. Each provider collects, processes, and shares your personal information, which may include biometric data, as set out in the [Jumio Privacy Notice](https://www.jumio.com/privacy-center/privacy-notices/online-services-notice/), and [Sumsub Privacy Notice](https://sumsub.com/privacy-notice-service/). 

 **12\. MARKETING**

We may only use Personal Data we collect from you for the purposes of direct marketing without your consent if the Personal Data does not include Sensitive Information, you would reasonably expect us to use or disclose the information for the purpose of direct marketing, we provide a simple way of opting out of direct marketing, and you have not requested to opt out of receiving direct marketing from us.

If we collect Personal Data about you from a third party, we will only use that information for the purposes of direct marketing if you have consented (or it is impracticable to obtain your consent), and we will provide a simple means by which you can easily request not to receive direct marketing communications from us. We will draw your attention to the fact that you may make such a request in our direct marketing communications**.**

You have the right to request us not to use or disclose your Personal Data for the purposes of direct marketing, or for the purposes of facilitating direct marketing by other organizations. We must give effect to the request within a reasonable period of time. You may also request that we provide you with the source of the information. If such a request is made, we must notify you of the source of the information free of charge within a reasonable period of time.

We may communicate company news, promotions, and information relating to our products and services provided by OKX. We may share Personal Data with third parties to help us with our marketing and promotional projects or sending marketing communications.

Users can opt out from these marketing communications at any time. If you do not want to receive these communications, please send an email to support@okcoin.com.
