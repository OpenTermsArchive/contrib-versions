**Account Registration**

In order to access certain features of the Site and Services and to post any Member Content on the Site or through the Services you must register to create an account (“**Account**”) and become a Member.

You may register directly via the Site or by logging into your account with certain third party social media or social networking sites ("**SNS**") (including, but not limited to, Facebook) via the Site, as described herein. If you decide to register through an SNS, we will extract the personal information you have provided to the SNS (such as your real name, username, email address and other information you make publicly available via the SNS) from the account you have with the applicable SNS and use that information to create your Account. The specific information that we extract may depend on the privacy settings you have with the SNS. You hereby consent to our access to and collection of all such personal information about you from any SNS you use to log into your account. During the registration process, you will be required to provide certain information and you will establish a username and a password.

You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete. Academia.edu reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Account if any information provided during the registration process or thereafter proves to be inaccurate, not current or incomplete. You are responsible for safeguarding your password. You agree that you will not disclose your password to any third party and that you will take sole responsibility for any activities or actions under your Account, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions. You will immediately notify Academia.edu of any unauthorized use of your Account.

  

**Privacy**

See Academia.edu’s Privacy Policy at [academia.edu/privacy](https://www.academia.edu/privacy) for information and notices concerning Academia.edu’s collection and use of your personal information.

  

**Payments**

Academia.edu may offer you the ability to access certain features through purchase of a recurring subscription (“Subscription”).

When you purchase a Subscription or make any other paid feature related purchase via the Services (each, a "Transaction"), you expressly authorize us (or our third party payment processor) to charge you for such Transaction. We may ask you to supply additional information relevant to your Transaction, including, without limitation, your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card, your billing address and additional information to verify your identity before completing your Transaction (such information, "Payment Information"). You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use all payment method(s) represented by any such Payment Information. When you initiate a Transaction, you authorize us to store and continue billing you using your Payment Information and to provide your Payment Information to our third party payment processors as needed to complete your Transactions. We may also periodically authorize your payment method in anticipation of applicable fees or related charges. Further, as part of our order processing procedures, we may screen orders for fraud or other undesirable activity. If we feel an order could be fraudulent, unauthorized, or illegal, we reserve the right to refuse to process that order. Your Subscription continues until cancelled by you or we terminate your access to or use of the Services or the Subscription in accordance with these Terms. We may in our discretion change the Subscription terms by providing you with a notice sent to your email address on file with us. It is your duty to keep your email address current. If you do not agree to any changes that we notify you about, you no longer have the right to use our Services, and you must cancel your Subscription. Your failure to cancel your Subscription constitutes your acceptance of the changes.

If you elect to purchase an annual or monthly Subscription, you will be charged the annual or monthly Subscription fee (“Subscription Fee”) plus any applicable taxes, at the beginning of your Subscription and each year or month thereafter, respectively, at the then-current rate offered to you. We may change the amount of the Subscription Fee upon prior notice to you. If you elect to purchase an annual Subscription, we (or our third party payment processor) will automatically charge you on the anniversary of the commencement of your Subscription using the Payment Information you have provided. If you elect to purchase a monthly Subscription, we (or our third party payment processor) will automatically charge you each month, on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your Subscription, using the Payment Information you have provided. In the event your Subscription began on a day not contained in a given month, your payment method will be charged on a day in the applicable month or such other day as we deem appropriate. For example, if you started your Subscription on January 31st, your next payment date is likely to be February 28th, and your payment method would be billed on that date.

By agreeing to these Terms and electing to purchase a Subscription, you acknowledge that your Subscription has recurring payment features and you accept responsibility for all recurring payment obligations prior to cancellation of your Subscription by you or Academia.edu. Please be aware that any Subscription Fee is exclusive of all taxes. If at any point any applicable sales use, VAT, GST, excise, withholding or similar taxes or levies, whether domestic or foreign, exist, the Member is liable for them.

Trials. We may offer Subscriptions on a free trial basis ("Free Trial") or discounted, paid trial basis ("Discounted Trial") for a specified period of time. If we offer you a Free Trial or Discounted Trial, the specific terms of your Free Trial or Discounted Trial will be provided at signup and/or in the promotional materials describing the trial and your use of the trial is subject to your compliance with such specific terms. Free Trials or Discounted Trials may not be combined with any other offer. Except as may otherwise be provided in the specific terms for the Free Trial or Discounted Trial offer, Free Trial or Discounted Trials are only available to users who have not previously subscribed to the service in connection with which the Free Trial or Discounted Trial is being offered. When you agree to a Free Trial or Discounted Trial, you are also agreeing to sign up for a Subscription as described above and, consequently, unless you cancel your Subscription prior to the end of your Free Trial or Discounted Trial, we (or our third party payment processor) will begin charging your payment method on a recurring basis for the Subscription Fee (plus any applicable taxes) until you cancel your Subscription. Instructions for cancelling your Subscription are stated below in the "Cancelling Subscriptions" section. We reserve the right to modify or terminate Free Trial or Discounted Trials at any time, without notice, and in our sole discretion.

Cancelling Subscriptions.

You may cancel your Subscription by email or online before your next charge date to avoid future charges. SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE LAW, PLEASE NOTE, HOWEVER, THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE THIRTY (30) DAY PERIOD FOLLOWING THE START OF YOUR SUBSCRIPTION, ALL SALES ARE FINAL AND AFTER THE FIRST THIRTY (30) DAY PERIOD FOLLOWING THE START OF YOUR SUBSCRIPTION YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A REFUND OF ANY PORTION OF THE SUBSCRIPTION FEE PAID FOR THE THEN CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD AT THE TIME OF CANCELLATION. To cancel, you can either (i) email us at support@academia.edu, or (ii) initiate a cancellation through your [account settings](https://www.academia.edu/settings) within the Services. You will be responsible for all Subscription Fees incurred for the then current Subscription period. If you cancel, your cancellation will become effective at the end of your current Subscription period. Subject to applicable law, you will not receive a refund for the current Subscription period but Academia.edu will allow you to access the Subscription features until the most recently paid-up Subscription period ends, and then we will terminate your access. Cancelling your Subscription won't cancel your Account. See the Termination and Account Cancellation section below for information on canceling your Account.

If we believe, in our sole discretion, that any Member of Academia.edu or Academia Premium or other Academia.edu paid services is in breach of our Terms, or acting outside of the letter or spirit of our Terms, we reserve the right to add limitations to your access to www.academia.edu, up to and including terminating all access to www.academia.edu. In this case, the Member in question is not eligible for any refunds on any portion of their subscription payment.

**Controlling Law**

These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in the "Dispute Resolution" section, the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes that you and Academia.edu are not required to arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in the City and County of San Francisco, and you and Academia.edu each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.

  

**Entire Agreement**

These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Academia.edu and you regarding the Site, Services, Collective Content and Output, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Academia.edu and you regarding the Site, Services, Collective Content and Output.

  

**Assignment**

You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Academia.edu’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. Academia.edu may assign or transfer these Terms, at its sole discretion, without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.

  

**Notices**

Any notices or other communications permitted or required hereunder, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be in writing and given by Academia.edu (i) via email (in each case to the address that you provide); or (ii) by posting to the Site. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.

  

**Dispute Resolution**

Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes. We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively, "Disputes") will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class or representative proceeding. You and Academia.edu agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and Academia.edu are each waiving the right to a trial by jury, the right to a trial by judge, or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.

Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Resolution. Before either party may initiate arbitration, the party must first provide the other with a written 'Notice of Dispute' that includes the claimant's name, account information, an individualized description of the dispute, the claimant's specific alleged injury, and the relief sought. Notices to Academia.edu must be sent to legal@academia.edu. Notices to you will be sent to the email address on file for your account. The parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute informally. If the dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Notice of Dispute, either party may commence arbitration.

Exceptions. As limited exceptions to the paragraph above: (i) we both may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it otherwise qualifies for small claims court jurisdiction; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of any copyright, trademark, patent or trade secrets.

Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules") and, as applicable, its Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules then in effect, except as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules are available at [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/) or by calling 1-800-778-7879. A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/). Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless you and Academia.edu both agree to a different location. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement, except as provided below under "Delegation of Arbitrability."

Mass Arbitration / Batching Procedures. If 25 or more arbitration demands of a substantially similar nature, alleging substantially similar or identical claims or causes of action, are filed against us by the same counsel or law firm (or collection of legal counsel or law firms), AAA shall (i) group the arbitration demands into batches of no more than 50 demands per group; and (ii) provide for resolution of each group or batch as a consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees and a single arbitrator assigned per group or batch. You and Academia agree to cooperate in good faith with AAA to implement the aforementioned protocol for mass, collective, and/or batch arbitrations with regard to resolution, fees, and administration. To the extent AAA does not enforce these batching procedures, the parties agree that AAA shall endeavor to assign multiple proceedings to a single, mutually agreeable merits arbitrator.

Delegation of Arbitrability Issues. Except as provided in this paragraph, the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, disputes concerning the enforceability, validity, or interpretation of the Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Resolution or Mass Arbitration / Batching Procedures shall be resolved exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction, not by an arbitrator.

Arbitration Costs. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. Academia.edu will bear those fees to the extent required by law and AAA Rules, but Academia.edu reserves the right to seek reallocation if the arbitrator determines a claim is frivolous, duplicative, or filed in bad faith.

Injunctive and Declaratory Relief. Except as provided in "Exceptions" above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you or Academia.edu seek 'public injunctive relief' i.e., relief whose primary purpose and effect is to prohibit unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the general public under California law), the claim for such relief may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction. All other claims remain subject to individual arbitration only. Any court proceeding for public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of individual claims in arbitration.

Class Action Waiver. **YOU AND ACADEMIA.EDU AGREE THAT NEITHER PARTY MAY ASSERT CLAIMS AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.** However, nothing in this section shall prevent you or Academia.edu from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims. Further, if the parties' Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.

Changes. Notwithstanding the provisions of the "Modification" section above, if Academia.edu changes this "Dispute Resolution" section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to [feedback@academia.edu](mailto:feedback@academia.edu)) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Last Updated Date" above or in the date of Academia.edu's email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Academia.edu in accordance with the provisions of this "Dispute Resolution" section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms). If you do not reject in writing any such changes to the "Dispute Resolution" section within 30 days of the date such change became effective, you consent to be bound by the "Dispute Resolution" terms as modified.

  

**Severability**

With the exception of any of the provisions in the Class Action Waiver section above, if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will still apply. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.

  

**Waiver**

The failure of Academia.edu to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Academia.edu. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.
