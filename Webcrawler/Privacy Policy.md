Once you leave our Services via a link or by clicking on an advertisement, it is important that you check the applicable privacy policy of the third party’s site or service. The fact that we link to a website or display a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization, or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices.
