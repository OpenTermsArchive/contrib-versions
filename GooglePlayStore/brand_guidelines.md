Brand guidelines
================

The "Android" name, the Android logo, the "Google Play" brand, and other Google trademarks, are property of Google LLC and not part of the assets available through the Android Open Source Project.

These guidelines correspond to and complement the marketing materials on the [Partner Marketing Hub](http://partnermarketinghub.withgoogle.com) and [Google Brand Permissions](https://www.google.com/permissions/).

All creatives that include or reference Android or Google trademarks must be reviewed and fully approved by the Android brand team. Below are relevant legal guidelines on how to display our trademarks. Use the [brand request form](https://support.google.com/contact/partner_brand_approval) to submit your marketing for review.

Android
-------

The use of the "Android" trademark on hardware, packaging or marketing materials of device is restricted to [Android-compatible](https://source.android.com/compatibility/index.html) devices only. Here are guidelines for the Android brand and related assets that can be used for compatible devices. For detailed guidance, please consult the [Partner Marketing Hub](http://partnermarketinghub.withgoogle.com).

The following are guidelines for the Android brand and related assets.

### Android in text

![](/images/brand/mediaplayer.png)

*   Android™ should have a trademark symbol the first time it appears in a creative.
*   Any use of the Android name needs to include this attribution in your communication: > _Android is a trademark of Google LLC._
*   Android should always be capitalized and is never plural or possessive.
*   "Android", or anything confusingly similar to "Android", cannot be used in names of applications or accessory products, including phones, tablets, TVs, speakers, headphones, watches, and other devices. Instead, use "for Android".
    *   Incorrect: "Android MediaPlayer" or "Ndroid MediaPlayer"
    *   Correct: "MediaPlayer for Android"
*   "Android TV", "Android Wear", "Android Auto", "Android Automotive OS", "Google Pay", and "Android Things" may only be used to identify or market products or services with prior approval. Use "for Android" or "with Android" for all other Android-based products.
    *   Incorrect: "Android TV Streaming Stick", "Streaming Stick with Android TV"
    *   Correct: "Streaming Stick with Android"
*   If used with your logo, "for Android" or "with Android" should be no larger than 90% of your logo’s size. The first instance of this use should be followed by a TM symbol: "for Android™".
*   Android may be used as a descriptor in text, as long as it is followed by a proper generic term and is not the name of your product, app, or service. Think of "Android" as a term used in place of "the Android platform."
    *   Incorrect: "Android MediaPlayer" or "Android XYZ app"
    *   Correct: "Android features" or "Android applications"
