Google Earth Content Policy
===========================

Child safety

Google has a zero-tolerance policy regarding child sexual abuse imagery.

If we become aware of child sexual abuse imagery on our properties, the content will be removed and we’ll report it and its owners and purveyors to the appropriate authorities.

Harassment

Do not harass or bully others.

Anyone using Google Earth to harass or bully may have the offending content removed or be permanently banned from the site. Online harassment is also illegal in many places and can have serious offline consequences.

Hate speech

We do not allow content that promotes hatred or violence against a group of people based on:

*   Race or ethnic origin
*   Religion
*   Disability, gender, or age
*   Veteran status, sexual orientation, or gender identity

Illegal activities

Keep it legal. Do not use Google Earth to engage or promote unlawful, dangerous, or illegal activities.

Impersonation & misleading content

When using Google Earth's authoring tools, do not pretend to be someone else. In addition, do not represent that your map is authorized by or produced by another company or organization, if that's not the case.

Participants must not divert users or provide links to any other site that mimics or passes itself off as another application or service. Additionally, your Google Earth projects must not contain misleading information in the title, features, or other map data.

Intellectual property

Do not upload or post content that someone else owns the copyright to without the necessary authorizations. This includes patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and other proprietary rights.

We also ask that you do not encourage or induce others to violate intellectual property rights. We respond to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement and take appropriate action.

Malicious content

We do not allow content that transmits viruses, malware, or any other malicious or harmful code. Do not distribute or link to content that harms or interferes with the operation of networks, servers, or other infrastructure.

Personal & confidential information

Do not publish or disclose private and confidential information belonging to other people unless you’re authorized to do so. This includes:

*   Government identification numbers
*   Credit card numbers
*   Driver's and other license numbers
*   Non-public contacts, or any other information that's not publicly available

Sexually explicit material

We do not allow sexually explicit images or videos such as nudity, sexually explicit material, or graphic sexual acts, nor do we allow links to commercial pornography sites.

Writing about adult topics is permitted as long as they aren't accompanied by sexually explicit images or videos, or any material that promotes or depicts inappropriate sexual acts with animals.

Spam

We do not allow spam, including unwanted promotional or commercial content, content created by an automated program, repetitive content, or anything that appears to be a mass solicitation.

Violence

Do not publish content that threatens serious physical injury or death, or rally support to physically harm others. In cases where there’s a serious and imminent physical threat of injury or death, we’ll take action.

Additionally, do not post or link to extremely graphic or violent materials for the sake of disgusting others. 

Graphic materials may be used to demonstrate a political or social viewpoint, such as animal abuse or war, but be sure that you aren't being gratuitously graphic.
