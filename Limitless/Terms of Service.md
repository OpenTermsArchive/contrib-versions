**11.4 Repeat Infringers.**

Limitless's policy is to: (a) remove or disable access to material that Limitless believes in good faith, upon notice from an intellectual property rights owner or authorized agent, is infringing the intellectual property rights of a third party by being made available through the Service; and (b) remove any User Content uploaded to the Service by repeat infringers.

If you receive a notification from Limitless that material made available by you on or through the Service has been the subject of a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then you will have the right to provide Limitless with what is called a “Counter Notification.” To be effective, a Counter Notification must be in writing, provided to Limitless's Designated Agent through one of the methods identified in Section 11.2, and include substantially the following information: (a) your physical or electronic signature; (b) identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled; (c) a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and (d) your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if you are residing outside of the United States, then for any judicial district in which Limitless may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under Section 11.2 above or an agent of that person. A party submitting a Counter Notification should consult a lawyer or see 17 U.S.C. § 512 to confirm the party's obligations to provide a valid counter notification under the Copyright Act.

**11.7 False Notifications of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notifications.**

The Copyright Act provides at 17 U.S.C. § 512(f) that: “\[a\]ny person who knowingly materially misrepresents under \[Section 512 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512)\] (1) that material or activity is infringing, or (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, will be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys' fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner's authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of \[Limitless\] relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.” Limitless reserves the right to seek damages from any party that submits a Notification of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notification in violation of the law.

**12\. Modification of Terms.**

We may, from time to time, change these Terms. Please check these Terms periodically for changes. Revisions will be effective immediately except that, for existing users, material revisions will be effective 30 days after posting or notice to you of the revisions unless otherwise stated. If a change to these Terms materially modifies your rights or obligations, we may require that you accept the modified Terms in order to continue to use the Service.

15.2 NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICE OR LIMITLESS ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE LIMITLESS ENTITIES OR THE SERVICE THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE SERVICE AND YOUR DEALING WITH ANY OTHER SERVICE USER. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU USE ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND THAT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY (INCLUDING YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR MOBILE DEVICE USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE) OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, INCLUDING USER CONTENT.

15.3 THE PENDANT MAY BE MANUFACTURED, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, BY A THIRD PARTY. ACCORDINGLY, WE DO NOT PROVIDE ANY WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE PENDANT OFFERED ON OUR WEBSITE, EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS LIMITED WARRANTIES THAT ACCOMPANY THE PENDANT AND ANY STATUTORY RIGHTS YOU MAY HAVE FOR A DEFECTIVE PENDANT. \[HOWEVER, THE PENDANT MAY BE COVERED BY THE MANUFACTURER'S WARRANTY AS DETAILED ON OUR WEBSITE AND INCLUDED WITH THE PENDANT.\]15.4 THE LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION 15 APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

**16\. Limitation of Liability.**

16.1 TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LIMITLESS ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICE, ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT ON THE SERVICE OR THESE TERMS, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT ANY LIMITLESS ENTITY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE.

THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 16 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

**17\. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration.**

**17.1 Generally.**

In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Limitless in the most expedient and cost effective manner, and except as described in Section 17.2 and 17.3, you and Limitless agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms, the Service, and communications from us will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, the Service, or any communications to or from us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND LIMITLESS ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

**17.2 Exceptions.**

Despite the provisions of Section 17.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.

**17.3 Opt-Out.**

If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt-out of the provisions of this Section 17 within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by sending a letter to Limitless AI, Attention: Legal Department - Arbitration Opt-Out, 2000 South Colorado Boulevard, Tower 1 Suite 222, Denver, CO 80222, United States, that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your account on the Service, and a statement that you wish to opt-out of arbitration (**“Opt-Out Notice”**). Once Limitless receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 17 will be void, and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section 18.2. The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice.

**17.4 Arbitrator.**

Any arbitration between you and Limitless will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association (**“AAA”**) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (**“AAA Rules”**) as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at +1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Limitless. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.

**17.5 Notice of Arbitration; Process.**

A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express or UPS (in either case, signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (**“Notice of Arbitration”**). Limitless's address for Notice is: Limitless AI, 2000 South Colorado Boulevard, Tower 1 Suite 222, Denver, CO 80222, United States. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (**“Demand”**). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Limitless may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Limitless must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by Limitless in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, Limitless will pay to you the higher of: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator and (b) US$10,000.

**17.6 Fees.**

If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Limitless will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than US$10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in the county and state of your residence, but if the claim is for US$10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your residence. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Limitless for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.

**17.7 No Class Actions.**

YOU AND LIMITLESS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. FURTHER, UNLESS BOTH YOU AND LIMITLESS AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.

**17.8 Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.**

If Limitless makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Limitless's address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Limitless's address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with Limitless will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.

**17.9 Enforceability.**

If Section 17.7 or the entirety of this Section 17 is found to be unenforceable, or if Limitless receives an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section 17 will be null and void and, in that case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 18.2 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.
