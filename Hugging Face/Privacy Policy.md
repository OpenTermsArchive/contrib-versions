The Policy is part of the Company Terms of Use. The Policy applies to all users of the Services (‚ÄúUsers‚Äù).

The Company reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change the Policy at any time, which change will be effective 10 days following posting the revision to the Policy on the Hugging Face website (the ‚ÄúWebsite‚Äù). Your continued use of the Services 10 days following such posting means you accept those changes.
