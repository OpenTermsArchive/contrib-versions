Hugging Face Privacy Policy
===========================

**🗓 Effective Date: March 28, 2023**

We have implemented this Privacy Policy because your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) describes the type of information that Hugging Face, Inc. (the “Company”) gathers from users of the Hugging Face services (the “Services”), and how the Company uses that information.

The Policy is part of the Company Terms of Use. The Policy applies to all users of the Services (“Users”).

The Company occasionally collects Personal Information from Users. “Personal Information” means any information that can, alone or associated with other information, be used to identify an individual, for instance by reference of a name, a username, an email address, an IP address, a photograph or others.

By using the Services, you consent to the terms of the Policy and to our processing of Personal Information in the manner and for the purposes set forth herein. If you do not agree with the Policy, please do not use the Services.

The Company reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change the Policy at any time, which change will be effective 10 days following posting the revision to the Policy on the Hugging Face website (the “Website”). Your continued use of the Services 10 days following such posting means you accept those changes.
