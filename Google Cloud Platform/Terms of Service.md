If you are accessing the Services as a customer of an unaffiliated Google Cloud reseller, these terms will apply to you in relation to your use of the Services (subject to the "Resold Customers" section of the applicable Service Specific Terms). Notwithstanding the applicability of these terms, if you fall under one of the exempt categories described at [https://cloud.google.com/terms/direct-tos-exemptions](https://cloud.google.com/terms/direct-tos-exemptions) for the applicable Services, these terms do not apply to you, unless you and Google agree otherwise in writing. If you become exempt from these terms after the Effective Date, this will not affect any liability arising between the parties prior to the date that you become exempt.

If you signed an offline variant of this Agreement for use of the Google Cloud Platform Services, Google Workspace Services, SecOps Services, or Looker (original) Services under the same Google Cloud Platform Services, Google Workspace, SecOps Services or Looker (original) Services Account, the terms below do not apply to you, and your offline terms govern your use of the applicable Services.

These Google Cloud Terms of Service (together, the "Agreement") are entered into by Google and the entity or person agreeing to these terms ("Customer") and govern Customer's access to and use of the Services. "Google" has the meaning given at [https://cloud.google.com/terms/google-entity](https://cloud.google.com/terms/google-entity).

This Agreement is effective when Customer clicks to accept or otherwise agrees to it (the "Effective Date"). If you are accepting on behalf of Customer, you represent and warrant that (i) you have full legal authority to bind Customer to this Agreement; (ii) you have read and understand this Agreement; and (iii) you agree, on behalf of Customer, to this Agreement.

**1. Provision of the Services.**

1.1 _Services Use._ During the Term, Google will provide the Services in accordance with this Agreement, including the SLAs, and Customer may use the Services, and integrate the GCP Services and Looker (original) Services into any Customer Application that has material value independent of the Services, in accordance with this Agreement. For clarity, Customer may not create or host Customer Applications using the Google Workspace Services or SecOps Services under this Agreement and may only integrate Looker (original) Services into a Customer Application as provided in the Service Specific Terms.

1.2 _Admin Console._ If applicable, Customer will have access to the Admin Console, through which Customer may manage its use of the Services.

1.3 _Accounts; Verification to Use GWS Services._

(a) _Accounts._ Customer must have an Account to use the Services and is responsible for the information it provides to create the Account, the security of its passwords for the Account (including any keys for Google APIs) and for any use of its Account. Google has no obligation to provide multiple accounts to Customer.

(b) _Verification to use GWS Services._ Customer must verify a Domain Email Address or a Domain Name to use GWS Services. If Customer does not have valid permission to use the Domain Email Address or does not own or control the Domain Name, then Google will have no obligation to provide Customer with GWS Services and may delete the Account without notice.

1.4 _Updates._

(a) _To the Services._ Google may make commercially reasonable updates to the Services from time to time.

(b) _To this Agreement._ Subject to subsections (i) and (ii), Google may make updates to this Agreement from time to time. Google will post any update to this Agreement to [https://cloud.google.com/terms/](https://cloud.google.com/terms/). This subsection 1.4(b) does not apply to updates to the URL Terms, which are governed by subsection 1.4(c) below.

(i) With respect to GCP Services and their corresponding TSS, unless otherwise noted by Google, material updates to this Agreement will become effective 30 days after they are posted. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, to the extent any updates apply to new functionality or are required to comply with applicable law, they will be effective immediately. If Customer does not agree to any update to the Agreement regarding GCP or its TSS, Customer may stop using the GCP Services or TSS. Customer may also terminate this Agreement for convenience under Section 8.4 (Termination for Convenience). Customer's continued use of the GCP Services or TSS after a material update will constitute Customer's consent to such update.

(ii) With respect to GWS Services, SecOpS Services, and Looker (original) Services, and their respective corresponding TSS, material updates to this Agreement will only take effect if and when Customer's Order Term renews.

(c) _To the URL Terms._ Google may make commercially reasonable updates to the URL Terms from time to time by posting any such update at the relevant URL Term. Unless otherwise noted by Google, material updates to the URL Terms will become effective 30 days after they are posted. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, to the extent the updates apply to new functionality or the Cloud Data Processing Addendum, or are required by applicable law, they will be effective immediately.

(d) _To the Cloud Data Processing Addendum._ Without limiting the generality of Section 1.4(c), Google may only update the Cloud Data Processing Addendum where such update is required to comply with applicable law or expressly permitted by the Cloud Data Processing Addendum, or where such update:

(i) is commercially reasonable;

(ii) does not result in a material reduction of the security of the Services;

(iii) does not expand the scope of or remove any restrictions on Google's processing of "Customer Personal Data," as described in the "Compliance with Customer’s Instructions" Section of the Cloud Data Processing Addendum; and

(iv) does not otherwise have a material adverse impact on Customer's rights under the Cloud Data Processing Addendum.

(e) _Discontinuation of Services._ Subject to the last sentence in this Section 1.4(e) (Discontinuation of Services), Google will notify Customer at least 12 months before: (i) discontinuing any Service (or associated material functionality) unless Google replaces such discontinued Service or functionality with a materially similar Service or functionality; or (ii) significantly modifying a Customer-facing Google API in a backwards-incompatible manner. Nothing in this Section 1.4(e) (Discontinuation of Services) limits Google's ability to make changes required to comply with applicable law, address a material security risk, or avoid a substantial economic or material technical burden. This Section 1.4(e) (Discontinuation of Services) does not apply to pre-general availability Services, offerings, or functionality. For GWS Services, this Section 1.4(e) will only apply to Core Services and will not apply to Other Services.

1.5 _Software._ If Google makes Software available to Customer, including third-party software, Customer's use of any Software is subject to the applicable provisions in the Service Specific Terms.

**2. Payment Terms.**

2.1 _Billing._

(a) _Billing Generally._

Google will issue an electronic bill or invoice to Customer for all Fees, including, if applicable, Fees based on Customer's use of the Services during the applicable Fee Accrual Period and any relevant Fees for TSS. If Google reasonably determines based on evidence available to Google that Customer is at risk of non-payment or that Customer’s Account is potentially fraudulent, then Google may invoice or charge Customer more frequently. Customer will pay all Fees in the currency stated in the bill or invoice. If Customer pays by credit card, debit card, or other non-invoiced form of payment, Customer will pay all Fees immediately at the end of the Fee Accrual Period or when otherwise charged by Google. If Customer pays by invoice, Customer will pay Google all invoiced amounts by the Payment Due Date. For GCP Services and GWS Services, Customer may change its payment method to any other method that Google may enable, subject to acceptance by Customer of any additional terms applicable to that payment method. Unless required by law, Customer's obligation to pay all Fees is non-cancellable. For GCP Services, GWS Services, and Looker (original) Services, Google's measurement tools will be used to determine Customer's usage of the Services. Google has no obligation to provide multiple bills. Payments made via wire transfer must include the bank information provided by Google.

(b) _Billing Options for GWS Services_. This subsection 2.1(b) applies only to GWS Services. Customer may elect one of the billing options below or any other option offered by Google when Customer places its order for the Services:

(i) _Flexible Plan_. If Customer selects this option, Customer will not be committed to purchase the Services for a pre-defined term, but will pay Fees based on its daily usage of the Services, billed monthly in arrears. Any partial day of Services usage will be rounded up to a full day of Services usage for the purposes of calculating Fees.

(ii) _Annual/Fixed-Term Plan_. If Customer selects this option, Customer will be committed to purchasing the Services for one or more annual terms (as selected by Customer). Google will bill Customer according to the terms associated with Customer's elections on the Order Form.

Google may change its offering of billing options (including by limiting or ceasing to offer any billing option) upon 30 days’ notice to Customer and any such change will take effect at the beginning of Customer’s next Order Term. Billing options may not be available to all customers.

2.2 _Taxes._

(a) Customer is responsible for any Taxes, and will pay Google for the Services without any reduction for Taxes. If Google is obligated to collect or pay any Taxes, the Taxes will be invoiced to Customer and Customer will pay such Taxes to Google, unless Customer provides Google with a timely and valid tax exemption certificate in respect of those Taxes.

(b) Customer will provide Google with any applicable tax identification information that Google may require under applicable law to ensure its compliance with applicable tax regulations and authorities in applicable jurisdictions. Customer will be liable to pay (or reimburse Google for) any taxes, interest, penalties, or fines arising out of any mis-declaration by Customer.

2.3 _Payment Disputes & Refunds._ Any payment disputes must be submitted in good faith before the Payment Due Date. If Google, having reviewed the dispute in good faith, determines that certain billing inaccuracies are attributable to Google, Google will not issue a corrected invoice, but will instead issue a credit memo specifying the incorrect amount in the affected invoice. If a disputed invoice has not yet been paid, Google will apply the credit memo amount to a disputed invoice and Customer will be responsible for paying the resulting net balance due on that invoice. Refunds given by Google for billing inaccuracies under this Section will only be in the form of credit for the Services. Nothing in this Agreement obligates Google to extend credit to any party, and Google may revise or revoke any previously-extended credit at any time.

2.4 _Delinquent Payments; Suspension._ Late payments (which, for clarity, do not include amounts subject to a good faith payment dispute submitted before the Payment Due Date), may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) from the Payment Due Date until paid in full. Customer will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by Google in collecting such delinquent amounts. Further, in the event of any late payment for the Services, Google may Suspend the Services.

2.5 _No Purchase Order Number Required._ Customer is obligated to pay all applicable Fees without any requirement for Google to provide a purchase order number on Google's invoice (or otherwise).

2.6 _Price Revisions._ Google may change the Prices at any time unless otherwise expressly agreed in an addendum or Order Form. For GWS Services and Looker (original) Services only, (a) Google will notify Customer at least 30 days in advance of any changes, and (b) Customer's pricing will change if and when Customer's Order Term renews after the 30-day period. If Customer objects to any change in Prices, Customer may terminate this Agreement for convenience under Section 8.4 (Termination for Convenience).

**3. Customer Obligations.**

3.1 _Compliance._ Customer will (a) ensure that Customer and its End Users' use of the Services complies with this Agreement, (b) use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent and terminate any unauthorized use of, or access to, the Services, and (c) promptly notify Google of any unauthorized use of, or access to, the Services, Account, or Customer's password of which Customer becomes aware. Google reserves the right to investigate any potential violation of the AUP by Customer, which may include reviewing Customer Applications, Customer Data, or Projects.

3.2 _Privacy_. Customer is responsible for any consents and notices required to permit (a) Customer's use and receipt of the Services and (b) Google's accessing, storing, and processing of data provided by Customer (including Customer Data, if applicable) under this Agreement.

3.3 _Restrictions._ Customer will not, and will not allow End Users to, (a) copy, modify, or create a derivative work of the Services; (b) reverse engineer, decompile, translate, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to extract any or all of the source code of, the Services (except to the extent such restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law); (c) sell, resell, sublicense, transfer, or distribute any or all of the Services; or (d) access or use the Services (i) for High Risk Activities; (ii) in violation of the AUP; (iii) in a manner intended to avoid incurring Fees (including creating multiple Customer Applications, Accounts, or Projects to simulate or act as a single Customer Application, Account, or Project (respectively)) or to circumvent Service-specific usage limits or quotas; (iv) to engage in cryptocurrency mining without Google's prior written approval; (v) to operate or enable any telecommunications service or in connection with any Customer Application that allows End Users to place calls or to receive calls from any public switched telephone network, unless otherwise described in the Service Specific Terms; (vi) to place or receive emergency service calls via the GWS Services, unless stated otherwise in the Service Specific Terms; (vii) for materials or activities that are subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) maintained by the United States Department of State; (viii) in a manner that breaches, or causes the breach of, Export Control Laws; or (ix) to transmit, store, or process health information subject to United States HIPAA regulations except as permitted by an executed HIPAA BAA.

3.4 _Documentation._ Google may provide Documentation for Customer's use of the Services.

3.5 _Copyright._ Google responds to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminates the Accounts of repeat infringers in appropriate circumstances as required to maintain safe harbor for online service providers under the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

3.6 _Third-Party Content Enforcement (or GCP Services)_. If Customer's primary use of the GCP Services is to host third-party content or facilitate the sale of goods or services between third parties on its platform, Customer will take the following steps to enforce compliance with the AUP: (a) publish policies defining what content is prohibited on its platform (e.g., illegal content); (b) maintain a publicly accessible method (e.g., webform or email alias) to receive notices of violation of that policy (in addition to a monitored communications channel for Google); and (c) promptly review and address any such notices, and remove content where appropriate.

3.7 _Additional Terms for GWS Services_. The following terms apply only to GWS Services:

(a) _Additional Products and Third-Party Offerings_. Optional Additional Products and Third-Party Offerings may be available for use in conjunction with the Services, and may be enabled or disabled through the Admin Console. Any use of Additional Products is subject to the Additional Product Terms, which are incorporated by reference into the Agreement and which may be updated by Google from time to time. Any use of Third-Party Offerings is subject to separate terms and policies with the relevant service provider.

(b) _Administration of GWS Services_. Customer may specify through the Admin Console one or more Administrators who will have the right to access Admin Accounts. Customer is responsible for (i) maintaining the confidentiality and security of the End User Accounts and associated passwords and (ii) any use of the End User Accounts. Customer agrees that Google’s responsibilities do not extend to the internal management or administration of the GWS Services for Customer or any End Users.

(c) _Abuse Monitoring_. Customer is solely responsible for monitoring, responding to, and otherwise processing emails sent to the "abuse" and "postmaster" aliases for Customer Domain Names, but Google may monitor emails sent to these aliases to allow Google to identify GWS Services abuse.

(d) _Requesting Additional End User Accounts During Order Term_. Customer may purchase additional End User Accounts during an Order Term by means of an additional Order Form or Reseller Order or by ordering via the Admin Console. Such additional End User Accounts will have a pro-rated term ending on the last day of the applicable Order Term.

**4. Suspension.**

4.1 _AUP Violations._ If Google becomes aware that Customer's or any End User's use of the Services violates the AUP, Google will notify Customer and request that Customer correct the violation. If Customer fails to correct the violation within 24 hours of Google's request, then Google may Suspend all or part of Customer's use of the Services until the violation is corrected. For GWS Services, Suspension of the Services may include removal or unsharing of content that violates the AUP.

4.2 _Other Suspension._ Notwithstanding Section 4.1 (AUP Violations), Google may immediately Suspend all or part of Customer's use of the Services if (a) Google reasonably believes Suspension is needed to protect the Services, Google’s infrastructure supporting the Services, or any other customer of the Services (or their end users); (b) there is suspected unauthorized third-party access to the Services; (c) Google reasonably believes that immediate Suspension is required to comply with any applicable law; or (d) Customer is in breach of Section 3.3 (Restrictions) or the Service Specific Terms. Google will lift any such Suspension when the circumstances giving rise to the Suspension have been resolved. At Customer's request, Google will, unless prohibited by applicable law, notify Customer of the basis for the Suspension as soon as is reasonably possible. For Suspension of End User Accounts for GWS Services, Google will provide Customer's Administrator the ability to restore End User Accounts in certain circumstances.

4.3 _Generative AI Safety and Abuse for GCP Services._ Google uses automated safety tools to detect abuse of Generative AI Services. Notwithstanding the "Handling of Prompts and Generated Output" section in the Service Specific Terms for GCP Services, if these tools detect potential abuse or violations of Google’s [AUP](https://cloud.google.com/terms/aup) or [Prohibited Use Policy](https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai/use-policy), Google may log Customer prompts solely for the purpose of reviewing and determining whether a violation has occurred. See the [Abuse Monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/abuse-monitoring) documentation page for more information about how logging prompts impacts Customer’s use of the GCP Services.

**5. Intellectual Property Rights; Protection of Customer Data; Feedback; Using Brand Features within the GWS Services.**

5.1 _Intellectual Property Rights._ Except as expressly stated in this Agreement, this Agreement does not grant either party any rights, implied or otherwise, to the other's content or any of the other's intellectual property. As between the parties, Customer retains all Intellectual Property Rights in Customer Data and Customer Applications, and Google retains all Intellectual Property Rights in the Services and Software.

5.2 _Protection of Customer Data._ Google will only access, use, and otherwise process Customer Data in accordance with the Cloud Data Processing Addendum and will not access, use, or process Customer Data for any other purpose. Google has implemented and will maintain technical, organizational, and physical measures to protect Customer Data, as further described in the Cloud Data Processing Addendum. If you are accessing the Services as a customer of an unaffiliated Google Cloud reseller, this Section 5.2 (Protection of Customer Data) is subject to the "Resold Customers" section of the applicable Service Specific Terms.

5.3 _Customer Feedback_. At its option, Customer may provide feedback or suggestions about the Services to Google ("Feedback"). If Customer provides Feedback, then Google and its Affiliates may use that Feedback without restriction and without obligation to Customer.

5.4 _Using Brand Features Within the GWS Services._ Google will display within the GWS Services only those Customer Brand Features that Customer authorizes by uploading them into the GWS Services. Google will display those Customer Brand Features within designated areas of the web pages displaying the Services to Customer or its End Users. Customer may specify details of this use in the Admin Console. Google may also display Google Brand Features on such web pages to indicate that the GWS Services are provided by Google.

**6. Technical Support Services.**

6.1 _By Customer._ Customer is responsible for technical support of its Customer Applications and Projects.

6.2 _By Google._ Subject to payment of applicable support Fees, Google will provide TSS to Customer during the Term in accordance with the TSS Guidelines. Certain TSS levels include a minimum recurring Fee as described at (a) for GCP Services, SecOps Services, and Looker Services, [https://cloud.google.com/skus](https://cloud.google.com/skus), and (b) for GWS Services, at [https://workspace.google.com/terms/tssg.html](https://workspace.google.com/terms/tssg.html). If Customer downgrades its TSS level during any calendar month, Google may continue to provide TSS at the same level and for the same TSS Fees as applied before the downgrade for the remainder of that month.

**7. Confidential Information.**

7.1 _Obligations._ The recipient will only use the disclosing party's Confidential Information to exercise the recipient's rights and fulfill its obligations under this Agreement, and will use reasonable care to protect against the disclosure of the disclosing party's Confidential Information. The recipient may disclose Confidential Information only to its and its Affiliates' employees, agents, subcontractors, or professional advisors ("Delegates") who need to know it and who have agreed in writing (or in the case of professional advisors are otherwise bound) to keep it confidential. The recipient will ensure that its Delegates use the received Confidential Information only to exercise rights and fulfill obligations under this Agreement.

7.2 _Required Disclosure._ Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, the recipient or its Affiliate may also disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by applicable Legal Process; provided that the recipient or its Affiliate uses commercially reasonable efforts to (a) promptly notify the other party before any such disclosure of its Confidential Information, and (b) comply with the other party's reasonable requests regarding its efforts to oppose the disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subsections (a) and (b) above will not apply if the recipient determines that complying with (a) and (b) could (i) result in a violation of Legal Process; (ii) obstruct a governmental investigation; or (iii) lead to death or serious physical harm to an individual.

**8. Term and Termination.**

8.1 _Agreement Term._ The term of this Agreement (the "Term") will begin on the Effective Date and continue until this Agreement is terminated as stated in this Section 8 (Term and Termination).

8.2 _GWS Services Renewal._ The following terms apply only to renewals of GWS Services:

(a) _With a Flexible Plan._ Order Terms for the Flexible Plan are monthly. At the end of each month, the Order Term will automatically renew for another month, unless canceled by Customer via the Admin Console.

(b) _With an Annual/Fixed-Term Plan._ At the end of each Order Term for an Annual/Fixed-Term Plan, the GWS Services will renew consistent with Customer's elections in the Order Form or Admin Console.

(c) _Generally._ Customer may use the Admin Console to adjust the number of End User Accounts to be renewed. Customer will continue to pay Google the then-current Fees for each renewed End User Account unless Customer and Google mutually agree otherwise. If either party does not want the GWS Services to renew, then it must notify the other party to this effect at least 15 days before the end of the then-current Order Term, and this notice of non-renewal will take effect at the end of the then-current Order Term.

8.3 _Termination for Breach._

(a) _Termination of an Order Form._ Either party may terminate an Order Form if the other party is in material breach of this Agreement and fails to cure that breach within 30 days after receipt of written notice.

(b) _Termination of this Agreement._ To the extent permitted by applicable law, either party may terminate this Agreement immediately on written notice if the other party is in material breach of this Agreement and fails to cure that breach within 30 days after receipt of written notice of the breach.

8.4 _Termination for GCP Services Inactivity._ Google reserves the right to terminate the provision of GCP Services to a Project upon 30 days' advance notice if, for a period of 60 days (a) Customer has not accessed the Admin Console or the Project has had no network activity and (b) such Project has not incurred any Fees for such Services.

8.5 _Termination for Convenience._ Customer may stop using the Services at any time. Subject to any financial commitments in an Order Form or addendum to this Agreement, Customer may terminate this Agreement for its convenience at any time on prior written notice and, upon termination, must cease use of the applicable Services. For purposes of GCP Services and TSS only, Google may terminate this Agreement or any applicable Order Form for its convenience at any time with 30 days' prior written notice to Customer. For the avoidance of doubt, any termination of this Agreement by Google for its convenience pursuant to the preceding sentence will not impact any active GWS Services, SecOps Services, or Looker (original) Services Order Forms, and this Agreement will continue to govern such GWS Services, SecOps Services, or Looker (original) Services Order Forms, as applicable, until their expiration or termination pursuant to this Agreement.

8.6 _Termination Due to Applicable Law; Violation of Laws._ Google may terminate this Agreement immediately on written notice if Google reasonably believes that (a) continued provision of any Service used by Customer would violate applicable law(s) or (b) Customer has violated or caused Google to violate any Anti-Bribery Laws or Export Control Laws.

8.7 _Effect of Termination or Non-Renewal._ Subject to the last sentence of Section 8.5 (Termination for Convenience), if this Agreement terminates, then all Order Forms also terminate. If this Agreement or an Order Form is terminated or not renewed, then (a) all rights and access to the Services (or in the case of termination of an Order Form, the applicable Services) will terminate (including access to Customer Data, if applicable), unless otherwise described in this Agreement or the Order Form, and (b) all Fees owed by Customer to Google under this Agreement or Order Form, as applicable, are immediately due upon Customer’s receipt of the final electronic bill or as stated in the final invoice.

8.8 _No Refunds._ Unless expressly stated otherwise in this Agreement or required by law, termination or non-renewal under any section of this Agreement (including the Cloud Data Processing Addendum or any Order Form) will not oblige Google to refund any Fees.

**9. Publicity.** Neither party may use the other party’s Brand Features or issue, publish, or present a press release, blog post, speech, social media post, or investor relations call or announcement discussing Customer’s use of the Services or this Agreement without the written consent of the other party, except as expressly permitted in this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, Customer may state publicly that it is a Google Cloud customer and display Brand Features in accordance with the Branding Guidelines. Google may use Customer's name and Brand Features in online or offline promotional materials of the Services. Any use of a party’s Brand Features will inure to the benefit of the party holding Intellectual Property Rights to those Brand Features.

**10. Representations and Warranties.** Each party represents and warrants that (a) it has full power and authority to enter into this Agreement, and (b) it will comply with all laws applicable to its provision, receipt, or use of the Services, as applicable.

**11. Disclaimer_._ Except as expressly provided for in this Agreement, Google does not make and expressly disclaims to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law (a) any warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular use, title, noninfringement, or error-free or uninterrupted use of the Services or Software; and (b) any representations about content or information accessible through the Services.**

**12. Limitation of Liability.**

**12.1 _Limitation on Indirect Liability._ To the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to Section 12.3 (Unlimited Liabilities), neither party will have any Liability arising out of or relating to this Agreement for any (a) indirect, consequential, special, incidental, or punitive damages or (b) lost revenues, profits, savings, or goodwill.**

**12.2 _Limitation on Amount of Liability._ Each party's total aggregate Liability for damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement in connection with the GCP Services, GWS Services, SecOps Services, or Looker (original) Services, as applicable, is limited to the Fees Customer paid for such Services during the 12 month period before the event giving rise to Liability, except Google’s total aggregate Liability for damages arising out of or related to Services or Software provided free of charge is limited to $5,000.**

**12.3 _Unlimited Liabilities._ Nothing in this Agreement excludes or limits either party's Liability for:**

**(a) its fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation;**

**(b) its obligations under Section 13 (Indemnification);**

**(c) its infringement of the other party's Intellectual Property Rights;**

**(d) its payment obligations under this Agreement; or**

**(e) matters for which liability cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.**

**13.** **Indemnification****.**

13.1 _Google Indemnification Obligations._ Google will defend Customer and its Affiliates using the Services under Customer’s Account and indemnify them against Indemnified Liabilities in any Third-Party Legal Proceeding to the extent arising from an allegation that any Service or any Google Brand Feature, in each case used in accordance with this Agreement, infringes the third party's Intellectual Property Rights.

13.2 _Customer Indemnification Obligations._ Customer will defend Google and its Affiliates providing the Services and indemnify them against Indemnified Liabilities in any Third-Party Legal Proceeding to the extent arising from (a) any Customer Application, Project, Customer Data, or Customer Brand Features; or (b) Customer's or an End User's use of the Services in breach of the AUP or Section 3.3 (Restrictions).

13.3 _Exclusions._ Sections 13.1 (Google Indemnification Obligations) and 13.2 (Customer Indemnification Obligations) will not apply to the extent the underlying allegation arises from (a) the indemnified party's breach of this Agreement, (b) a combination of the indemnifying party's technology or Brand Features with materials not provided by the indemnifying party under this Agreement, unless the combination is required by this Agreement, or (c) in the case of Google or any of its Affiliates as the indemnifying party, any Services provided to Customer free of charge.

13.4 _Conditions._ Sections 13.1 (Google Indemnification Obligations) and 13.2 (Customer Indemnification Obligations) are conditioned on the following:

(a) Any indemnified party must promptly notify the indemnifying party in writing of any allegation(s) that preceded the Third-Party Legal Proceeding and cooperate reasonably with the indemnifying party to resolve the allegation(s) and Third-Party Legal Proceeding. If breach of this Section 13.4(a) prejudices the defense of the Third-Party Legal Proceeding, the indemnifying party's obligations under Section 13.1 (Google Indemnification Obligations) or 13.2 (Customer Indemnification Obligations) (as applicable) will be reduced in proportion to the prejudice.

(b) Any indemnified party must tender sole control of the indemnified portion of the Third-Party Legal Proceeding to the indemnifying party, subject to the following: (i) the indemnified party may appoint its own non-controlling counsel, at its own expense; and (ii) any settlement requiring the indemnified party to admit liability, pay money, or take (or refrain from taking) any action, will require the indemnified party's prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.

13.5 _Remedies._

(a) If Google reasonably believes the Services might infringe a third party's Intellectual Property Rights, then Google may, at its sole option and expense (i) procure the right for Customer to continue using the Services; (ii) modify the Services to make them non-infringing without materially reducing their functionality; or (iii) replace the Services with a non-infringing alternative that has materially equivalent functionality.

(b) If Google does not believe the remedies in Section 13.5(a) are commercially reasonable, then Google may Suspend or terminate Customer's use of the impacted Services. If Google terminates the impacted Services, then upon Customer request Google will refund to Customer any unused prepaid Fees that Customer paid to Google for use of the terminated Services.

13.6 _Sole Rights and Obligations._ Without affecting either party's termination rights and to the extent permitted by applicable law, this Section 13 (Indemnification) states the parties' sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement for any third-party allegations of Intellectual Property Rights infringement covered by this Section 13 (Indemnification).
