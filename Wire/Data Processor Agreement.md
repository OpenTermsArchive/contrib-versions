1.1 Object of the DPA: Wire shall provide the Controller with the service as described in the ToU (“Service”) and shall process personal data as part of the performance of Services on behalf of the Controller.

1.2. Nature, purpose and duration of processing: The data processing shall serve the purpose of providing a software solution for messaging services as described in the ToU being an integral part of the Service. The duration of the processing shall be in line with the duration of the provision of the Service.

1.3. Group of data subjects: Users of the Service whom the Controller enrolls to the Service as well as persons whose personal data is included in the content of the communication between the users.

Metadata of the Service; this, particularly, includes information on the creator of a team, conversation name and pseudonymised participants list as well as the team assignments of the participants;  
full name and email address and / or mobile phone number;  
temporary traffic data of the Service like log files including user’s type of equipment and IP addresses;  
end-to-end encrypted communication data, such as messages and files (Wire only temporarily stores encrypted messages on its servers for the purpose of allowing those messages to later be delivered to offline clients once the clients get back online. Wire does not hold the decryption keys to those messages and therefore cannot access the content);  
data separately provided by the user, e. g. profile picture.

1.5. Processor: With respect to the processing of personal data as part of this DPA, Wire is the Processor in the meaning of Art. 4 (8) GDPR.

If the agreed performances are nevertheless provided outside the area of Member States of the European Union or Switzerland on instructions of the Controller, Wire shall ensure that the transfer of personal data is admissible pursuant to Art. 44 et seqq. GDPR by making sure that at least one of the following conditions is met:

There is an adequacy decision by the European Commission for the third country;  
appropriate safeguards are put in place (i.e. binding corporate rules (BCR), standard data protection clauses, approved codes of conduct or certification mechanisms);  
the data transfer is covered by derogations for specific situations pursuant to Art. 49 GDPR.

1.7. Instructions by the Controller: Wire will process personal data as the Processor as specified in the ToU and the DPA. The ToU and the DPA contain all instructions by the Controller on data processing. Accordingly, Wire will process the data:

Insofar as required with respect to the scope and type for the purpose of providing the Service and for meeting the obligations from the ToU and this DPA;  
insofar as Wire is obliged to do so pursuant to the law of the European Union of the law of the Member States to which Wire is subject (in such a case, Wire shall notify the Controller of that legal requirement before processing, unlee that law prohibits such notification on important grounds of public interest).

The Controller shall retain the right to issue instructions regarding the data processing according to the provision of the ToU and this DPA. Instructions by the Controller shall be agreed with Wire and documented. Any expenses incurred by Wire for this purpose shall be reimbursed by the Controller.
