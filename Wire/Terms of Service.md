You understand and agree that you will be deemed to have accepted the updated ToU if you use the Apps, the Site and/or the Service after the updated ToU is made available to you. If at any point you do not agree to any portion of the ToU then in effect, you should immediately stop using the Apps, the Site and/or the Service.

### 3\. Provision of the service

You are solely responsible for all data, SMS and mobile carrier charges in connection with the mobile phones on which you have installed the Mobile App. You are responsible for any Internet connection and telecommunications fees and charges that you incur when accessing the Service or using the Desktop App and/or the Web App. You acknowledge and agree that the Company may make changes to the Apps, the Site and/or the Service at any time without notifying you in advance.

### 4\. Discontinuation of service

The Company reserves the right to deny service to any person or entity at the Company’s sole and absolute discretion. You acknowledge and agree that the Company may stop providing the Apps, the Site and/or the Service or restrict your use of the Apps, the Site and/or the Service any time, without notifying you in advance, for any reason or no reason including, without limitation, for any violation of this ToU and/or if the Company suspects that you have used any aspect of the Service to conduct any fraudulent or illegal activity. If the Company disables your access to your account, you may be prevented from accessing the Service, your account details or any materials contained in your account.

### 5\. Accounts and Security

5.1 **Account**. To access the Service, you must have an account linked to a Team. You can create an account by completing the registration process, which requires you to enter personal information, such as your name, phone number or email address. You will also have the option of uploading a profile picture and other information. You agree to submit information that belongs to you for service provisioning of your account. You agree that if you give the Apps permission to access your address book, anonymized phone numbers and emails from the address book will be uploaded to the Service for the purpose of connecting users. On certain platforms, it might be necessary to grant such permission in order to install the Apps, but this permission can be revoked after installation.

5.2 **Fees.**  
a. You agree to pay all applicable fees and taxes incurred by you, the Team, the Team Members or anyone using the account or the accounts linked to your Team or Team Admin, including, without limitation, fees relating to transactions processed by your account or the accounts of your Team Members. Unless otherwise noted, all currency references are in Euros. All initial fees and charges are payable in accordance with the payment terms agreed to by you when establishing your account and all fees and charges for any subscription renewal will increase by up to 7% above the initial applicable fees in the prior term, unless the Company provides you with notice of different fees and pricing at least 90 days prior to the beginning of the applicable renewal term. Except as expressly provided when establishing your account, renewal of any promotional or one-time priced subscriptions will be priced at the applicable list price in effect at the time of the subscription renewal. We may, from time to time, modify, amend, or supplement our rates, payment terms and billing procedures, and such changes shall be effective immediately upon posting a link to an update of this ToU or posting such changes elsewhere on the Site or the Apps. If there is a dispute regarding your payment of fees, or the Service, we shall have the right to terminate your account without prior notice. We also may apply interest and late fees for any amounts paid following the date when due, and we may terminate or suspend your account for any failure to timely pay any amounts or maintain up-to-date payment method information within your account.  
b. Charges are billed to the payment method you registered when initiating your account. When you register a credit or debit card for a new account, you authorize us to place a pending charge to the credit or debit card to verify your billing address and the validity of your credit or debit card, which pending charges are temporary and will not be converted into an actual charge. Pending charges, while pending, will, however, reduce the available amount of credit on your credit card or funds available to your debit card. You are solely responsible for any and all fees charged to your credit or debit card by the issuer, bank, or financial institution, including fees for membership, any overdraft or other insufficient funds, or for exceeding any applicable credit limit. Once your account is authenticated, the payment method that you registered with your account will be charged pursuant to the subscription that you initiated. You agree that the issuer of any credit or debit card registered with your account will accept this ToU as your authorization and pay all amounts billed in connection with your use of your account without us submitting a signed receipt, and failure to receive a bill, including a paper bill does not release you from your payment obligations under this ToU.

c. Unless you cancel your service at least 90 days prior to the end of your subscription period, your subscription will automatically be renewed for an additional 12 months and we will automatically bill you on the anniversary of the date on which you first commenced payment for your subscription. Subscriptions are fully earned upon payment. Although we endeavor to bill you as described in this paragraph, we reserve the right to change the timing of our billing as necessary, from time to time, and at any time. We may authorize your payment method in anticipation of account or service-related charges. As used in this ToU, “billing” shall indicate a charge, debit, or other payment clearance, as applicable, against your registered credit or debit card information.

d. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ANY APPLICABLE FEES AND OTHER CHARGES ARE NON-REFUNDABLE BY COMPANY IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNLESS SPECIFIED OTHERWISE. YOU ARE FULLY LIABLE FOR ALL CHARGES TO YOUR ACCOUNT, INCLUDING ANY UNAUTHORIZED CHARGES. THE COMPANY SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR FAILURE TO CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AT LEAST 90 DAYS PRIOR TO THE END OF YOUR CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD.

e. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in some cases, you may be provided a free trial to use the Service for a limited period of time free of charge, as may be set forth on the Site. In the case of any free trial, you will not be charged during the free trial period. Free trials may be subject to various limitations, including, without limitation, a limited number of Team Members and/or a limited time period for the free trial. When you agree to a free trial for the Service, you may be asked to authorize, and by accepting this ToU, you hereby expressly authorize us to charge the applicable fees for the Service to your designated billing payment method upon the expiration of the free trial, in each case, as set forth on the Site. For clarity, you must notify us of your determination to terminate a free trial on or before the last day of the free trial. Unless otherwise set forth on the Site, upon the expiration of a free trial, you will not be able to utilize the Service without subscribing.

5.3 **Account Sharing or Transfers**. Accounts are registered to a Team for a set number of Team Members and may not be sold, traded, gifted or otherwise transferred at any time under any circumstances. Team Admins and Team Members should not share accounts with, or disclose their passwords to, anyone else. If you are a Team Member, you acknowledge and agree that a Team Admin will have administrative controls over your account, including, without limitation, the ability to manage your access to the account and the Apps as a Team Member.

5.4 Cancellation. You may cancel your subscription at any time. The Company does not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods. Team Admins may cancel Team Member accounts by following the cancel instructions in the Apps. Once you cancel a Team Member account, the Team Member’s personal information will no longer be viewable by other users. However, information previously shared by the cancelled Team Member with other Team Members will remain viewable by those Team Members until they delete such information. Once a Team account is cancelled all associated Team Member accounts will be cancelled as well and you may no longer have access to the content shared among the Team Members.

5.5 Removing Accounts. We reserve the right to remove inactive accounts. Accounts are considered to be inactive when they are no longer paid for.

5.6 Account Disabling by the Company. The Company may at any time disable your account (including any Team Admin or Team Member account) if: a. The Company determines that you are (i) in breach of or otherwise acting inconsistently with this ToU, or (ii) engaging in fraudulent or illegal activities or other conduct that may result in liability to the Company; b. The Company determines it is required by law to disable your account; or c. The Company decides to stop providing the Service or critical portions of the Service in the country where you reside, use the Apps, access the Site or use the Service or the Company determines that it is no longer in its business interests to continue providing the Service or critical portions of the Service. The Company’s disabling of your account may result in the deletion of certain content on the Service and you may no longer have access to certain content; however, some content, such as your chat conversations with other Team Members and/or users, will remain viewable by those Team Members and/or users.

5.7 Effect of Account Disabling or Cancellation. Accounts disabled by the Company, including for any type of abuse (including without limitation a violation of this ToU), may not be able to be reactivated. If you voluntarily cancel your account, you may reactivate that account by contacting us through Customer Support. Notwithstanding the disabling or termination of your account, the terms of this ToU will survive and continue to apply to you.

Your data is also not used for targeted ads, or any other kind of profiling. This Privacy Policy informs you about how we process your data when you use the app offered by us and/or additional Wire products (together “Wire services”) and what rights you have as a data subject towards us.

### 2\. Conversation content

All conversation content is encrypted with strong encryption on the sender’s device and is only decrypted on the recipient’s device (also known as end-to-end encryption). This includes the files, images, audio, video, and location you decide to share in conversations or calls, which may also be personal and sensitive user data. Wire doesn’t hold the decryption keys, and our software contains no backdoor. Your conversations are yours — Wire‘s server has no decrypted access to them. Your end-to-end encrypted conversation content is temporarily stored in our server.

You may delete the content of the conversations on your device specifically and generally at any time.

In addition, Wire also uses transport encryption to encrypt metadata.

Wire only temporarily stores encrypted messages on its servers and automatically deletes them after they are sent to the recipient. This is done to enable Wire to send messages to users who are not currently online as soon as they are back online.

The legal basis for the transmission and storage of conversations is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR (fulfillment of contract).

### 3\. Logs files

When you use Wire services, we may collect technical data, so-called “log files”, with each access. The collection of log files serves the purpose of providing Wire services. The legal basis for the collection is Art. 6 § 1 b) DS-GVO (fulfilment of contract).

Log files are kept for a maximum of 72 hours, and only to facilitate troubleshooting, improve the service and prevent misuse. The legal basis for storage is Art. 6 § 1 f) GDPR (legitimate interest). Our legitimate interest is the trouble-free provision of the Wire services.

### 4\. Profile Information that you provide

When you create an account with Wire, we ask you to provide a name and a mobile phone number or email address, and if you want, you can also upload a profile picture, which may also be personal and sensitive user data (“Profile Information”).

If you have registered with a phone number, this information will not be displayed to other Wire users. If you registered with an email address, your email address may be visible to other users when using Wire Pro, depending on your preferences. We store your profile information only for the duration of your account usage in our servers. If you delete your account, we will delete your profile information immediately. You can change or delete your profile data at any time. The legal basis for the processing of your profile data is Art. 6 § 1 b) GDPR (fulfillment of contract).

In addition, other types of information related to the specific transaction may be collected, such as transaction amount and duration. The legal basis for the processing of the above-mentioned data is Art. 6 § 1 b) GDPR (fulfilment of contract), if we collect and store data for tax reasons, the legal basis is Art. 6 § 1 c) GDPR (fulfilment of a legal obligation). We delete this data within 6 months after our contract with you is terminated or after the expiry of any existing legal obligation to retain data.

### 6\. Processing of data in response to requests

We delete your data after the processing of your inquiry is completed.

If you have provided an e-mail address, Wire may send you e-mails to inform you of important changes (e.g. to confirm your e-mail address or to inform you that a new device has been added to your account). This is to help us provide you with a more secure experience with your account. The legal basis for the processing of this personal data is Art. 6 § 1 b) GDPR (fulfilment of contract).

### 7\. Newsletters

A subcontractor involvement requires that the Processor (a) ensures that the subcontractor fulfils Processor’s duties according to this DPA and (b) assumes liability towards the data subject for actions of the subcontractor concerned, as if these actions were taken by the Processor itself. At the time of the conclusion of this DPA, Wire engages the following subcontractors: Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL, 38 avenue John F. Kennedy, L-1855 Luxembourg for the provision of the server infrastructure and Zeta Project Germany GmbH, Rosenthaler Str. 40, 10178 Berlin, for the development of the services. Wire shall inform the Controller about the involvement of any further or replacement of any subcontractor. The Controller shall have the opportunity to object to the involvement within one month after having been informed. In the event of Controller’s objection, Wire shall be entitled to an extraordinary termination right.

6.2. Territorial scope: The Processor may not use any subcontractors located outside the Member States of the European Union, the European Economic Area or Switzerland for processing personal data.

### 7\. Deletion / return of personal data

7.1. Deletion: Upon termination of the DPA or when requested by the Controller, the Processor, at the choice of the Controller, shall return to the Controller all personal data available at the Processor and shall delete copies, if any, provided that no legal obligation to keep the personal data exists pursuant to the law of the Union or the Member States to which Wire is subject.
