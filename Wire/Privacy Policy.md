### 1\. Our Privacy Commitment

Wire Swiss GmbH (“Wire” “we” “us”), as the responsible party within the meaning of data protection law, is committed to protecting your data. Wire does not rent or sell your data to third parties. Your data is also not used for targeted ads, or any other kind of profiling. This Privacy Policy informs you about how we process your data when you use the app offered by us and/or additional Wire products (together “Wire services”) and what rights you have as a data subject towards us.

You can contact our Data Protection Officer (DPO) at privacy@wire.com. You can address inquiries to them regarding your data, its protection and its treatment by Wire.

### 2\. Conversation content

All conversation content is encrypted with strong encryption on the sender’s device and is only decrypted on the recipient’s device (also known as end-to-end encryption). Wire doesn’t hold the decryption keys, and our software contains no backdoor. Your conversations are yours — Wire has no access to them. You may delete the content of the conversations on your device specifically and generally at any time.

In addition, Wire also uses transport encryption to encrypt metadata.

Wire only temporarily stores encrypted messages on its servers and automatically deletes them after they are sent to the recipient. This is done to enable Wire to send messages to users who are not currently online as soon as they are back online.

The legal basis for the transmission and storage of conversations is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR (fulfilment of contract).

### 3\. Logs files

When you use Wire services, we may collect technical data, so-called “log files”, with each access. The collection of log files serves the purpose of providing Wire services. The legal basis for the collection is Art. 6 § 1 b) DS-GVO (fulfilment of contract).

Log files are kept for a maximum of 72 hours, and only to facilitate troubleshooting, improve the service and prevent misuse. The legal basis for storage is Art. 6 § 1 f) GDPR (legitimate interest). Our legitimate interest is the trouble-free provision of the Wire services.

### 4\. Profile Information that you provide

When you create an account with Wire, we ask you to provide a name and a mobile phone number or email address (“Profile Information”). The Profile Information you provide will be used for the purpose of providing Wire services and may be displayed to other Wire users when they search for you or connect to you through Wire services. If you have registered with a phone number, this information will not be displayed to other Wire users. If you registered with an email address, your email address may be visible to other users when using Wire Pro, depending on your preferences. We store your profile information only for the duration of your account usage. If you delete your account, we will delete your profile information immediately. You can change or delete your profile data at any time. The legal basis for the processing of your profile data is Art. 6 § 1 b) GDPR (fulfilment of contract).

### 5\. Data relevant to payment

If you create a Team Admin account or Team Member account with Wire, we may ask you for additional information for billing purposes and may share that information with a billing provider (“Data relevant to payment”). In order to make purchases through Wire services using a Team Admin account, Team Admins must provide a payment method and may be required to provide additional information such as billing address, phone number, email address, and zip code if required for tax purposes or to complete billing. In addition, other types of information related to the specific transaction may be collected, such as transaction amount and duration. The legal basis for the processing of the above-mentioned data is Art. 6 § 1 b) GDPR (fulfilment of contract), if we collect and store data for tax reasons, the legal basis is Art. 6 § 1 c) GDPR (fulfilment of a legal obligation). We delete this data within 6 months after our contract with you is terminated or after the expiry of any existing legal obligation to retain data.

### 6\. Processing of data in response to requests

If you send us an inquiry about our products as an interested party, we collect the information you provide, such as your name, e-mail address or other contact information you provide us with. We process this information for the purpose of answering your inquiry. The legal basis for the processing of your above-mentioned personal data is Art. 6 § 1 b) GDPR (contract initiation). We delete your data after the processing of your inquiry is completed.

If you have provided an e-mail address, Wire may send you e-mails to inform you of important changes (e.g. to confirm your e-mail address or to inform you that a new device has been added to your account). This is to help us provide you with a more secure experience with your account. The legal basis for the processing of this personal data is Art. 6 § 1 b) GDPR (fulfilment of contract).

### 7\. Newsletters

If you have given us your consent for the purpose of receiving our newsletter with information about Wire’s offers and products by e-mail, Wire will process your e-mail address and name to send you the newsletter. The legal basis for the processing of your data is your consent in accordance with Art. 6 § 1 a) GDPR. You can unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time. For this purpose there is a link in every newsletter. We only store your data for this purpose for as long as the newsletter subscription is active.

### 8\. Additional technical data

Wire stores additional technical data (such as the type of device through which you authorized the Wire application) to be able to route data between user devices. The Wire service is designed to keep additional technical data to the minimum required to operate the service.

More information about additional data can be found in the Privacy Whitepaper and the Security Whitepaper.

### 9\. Address book data

Insofar as personal data are processed for this purpose and your consent is required for processing, we will only process your data after you have given your consent (Art. 6 § 1 a) GDPR). Insofar as personal data is processed for this purpose and your consent is not required for processing, we process your data on the basis of legitimate interest (Art. 6 § 1 f) GDPR). Our legitimate interest is the trouble-free provision of the Wire services. You can prevent the processing of your data for these purposes at any time (see FAQ).
