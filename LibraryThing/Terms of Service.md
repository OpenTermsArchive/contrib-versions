Terms of Service
----------------

### EU Members and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

LibraryThing abides by US law. We also intend to voluntarily follow the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which applies to EU citizens and residents. We must therefore identify who is and who is not covered by the GDPR.

As of May 25, 2018, LibraryThing has assigned EU status to members based upon their IP address at sign-up, or, where that is not available to us, recent usage. This status does not change unless changed by the member.

To change your EU status, go to your Member [Privacy Center](https://www.librarything.com/settings/privacy). Choosing the incorrect legal status is a violation of LibraryThing's Terms of Service.

#### Data Protection Officer

Per the GDPR, LibraryThing's Data Protection Officer (DPO) is Tim Spalding. Our DPO can be reached at tim@librarything.com.

#### The GDPR's Defined Roles and the Handling of Data in LibraryThing and TinyCat

Under the terms of the GDPR, LibraryThing operates as either **data controller** or **data processor**, depending on whether the service is provided to users directly, or to organizations which have their own users.

For TinyCat customers—excepting free, personal members—LibraryThing is assumed to be in the position of data processor, and the customer in the position of data controller, managing the data of their **data subjects**. The same may apply to LibraryThing customers using LibraryThing's "lending" feature or otherwise providing LibraryThing to others.

It is the data controller's ultimate responsibility for controlling their patron or student (i.e., data subject) data, and ensuring GDPR compliance for their data subjects, including collecting consent, managing consent-revocation, enabling access, etc.

### Copyright

By posting content to LibraryThing, you grant—and you represent and warrant that you have the right to grant, represent and warrant—LibraryThing a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, omnipotent, royalty-free, fully-transferable and sublicenseable right to display, use, analyze, aggregate, modify, adapt, publish, translate, transform, create derivative works from and perform in any venue or media, online or offline, as well as

> "In Painting, Sculpture, and rapt Poesy, / And arts, though unimagined, yet to be." (Shelley, _Prometheus Unbound_)

**We do NOT assert copyright over the things you post to LibraryThing. The phrase "non-exclusive" above means you can post your content elsewhere.** By posting something to LibraryThing you let us use it, but you do not restrict what you can do with it. We love it when people post their reviews on their blog, on Amazon and other sites!

As stated above, LibraryThing will not sell any personally-identifiable information to any third party.

You can control whether your reviews will ever be made available to libraries or others. Click [here](https://www.librarything.com/editprofile.php) to edit your profile and change your preference.

### Get off my lawn, you kids!

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) severely restricts what information can be collected from children under 13. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) also severely restricts what information can be collected from children under 16. For these reasons, all children under 13 are prohibited from using LibraryThing, and, unfortunately, all European Union children under 16 are prohibited from using LibraryThing. _Au revoir mes petits choux!_

LibraryThing's age minimum does NOT apply to TinyCat customers providing TinyCat to others. TinyCat libraries are, in this case, the data controller/s and are responsible for ensuring GDPR compliance for their patrons. TinyCat does not provide messaging or social networking features to patrons.

LibraryThing is a warm and welcoming community, and almost everyone is nice. But younger members, and members of all ages, are warned not to provide profile information without weighing the risks and benefits, and never to provide their phone number, address, or other critical personal data online.

### DMCA

If you believe that your copyrighted work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please notify LibraryThing as set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 ("DMCA"). For your complaint to be valid under the DMCA, you must provide the following information in writing:

1.  An electronic or physical signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner;
2.  Identification of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed;
3.  Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing and where it is located on the Service;
4.  Information reasonably sufficient to permit LibraryThing to contact you, such as your address, telephone number, and, e-mail address;
5.  A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or law; and
6.  A statement, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information is accurate, and that you are the copyright owner or are authorized to act on behalf of the owner.

The above information should be submitted to the following designated agent:

> Tim Spalding  
> LibraryThing, Inc.  
> Attn: DMCA Notice  
> 286 Spring Street #2, Portland, ME 04102  
> Phone: 207-899-4108  
> Email: [info![AT SIGN](https://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/squiggle.gif)librarything.com](mailto:info@librarything.com)

UNDER FEDERAL LAW, IF YOU KNOWINGLY MISREPRESENT THAT ONLINE MATERIAL IS INFRINGING, YOU MAY BE SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL PROSECUTION FOR PERJURY AND CIVIL PENALTIES, INCLUDING MONETARY DAMAGES, COURT COSTS, AND ATTORNEYS' FEES.

Please note that this procedure is exclusively for notifying LibraryThing and its affiliates that your copyrighted material has been infringed. The preceding requirements are intended to comply with LibraryThing's rights and obligations under the DMCA, including 17 U.S.C. §512(c), but do not constitute legal advice. It may be advisable to contact an attorney regarding your rights and obligations under the DMCA and other applicable laws.

Please also note that we laugh off requests to remove books you don't like on DMCA grounds. Book titles and author names are not copyrightable. That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works.

### HIPAA Compliance and Patron Privacy

If you're a health industry organization considering [TinyCat](https://www.librarycat.org/) and LibraryThing for tracking patrons and lending data, please be advised that LibraryThing does not ensure full [HIPAA](http://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/) compliance.

Consider these tips to maintain patron privacy within TinyCat and LibraryThing:

*   Do not share your admin login with anyone unless you expect them to have access to all of your library and patron data.
*   Do not add patron information, such as names and phone numbers, but use only patron barcodes or IDs.
*   If you have Simple Circulation enabled, go to your [Patron Accounts Settings](https://www.librarycat.org/admin/settings/patronaccounts), and select _Barcode/ID_ under the "Patron list" setting. This will protect the privacy of your patrons' names.
*   If you have Full Circulation enabled, go to your [Patrons Settings](https://www.librarycat.org/admin/settings/patronsettings) and make sure that all patron fields except "Barcode/Patron ID" are set to _Admin only_. Set the "Barcode/Patron ID" field to _Patron can see_, if you prefer.

### Cookies

"Cookies" are files with small amount of data that is commonly used as an anonymous unique identifier. These are sent to your browser from the website that you visit and are stored on your devices' internal memory. LibraryThing services may use cookies to provide automatic sign-in for certain features. You have the option to set up your device to accept or refuse these cookies, and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.

#### Third Party Cookies

LibraryThing uses third-party cookies from Google to anonymously track web usage and analytics ([Google](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/)). These cookies are not essential to site functionality.

When users are not signed in, some LibraryThing pages include Google Adsense advertisements, which set cookies. These cookies are not involved in any site operation, and are not visible to LibraryThing. Google has some new privacy tools for this, debuting soon. For now, out of an abundance of caution, LibraryThing has decided to exclude all Google Adsense advertisements for users determined to be visiting from the EU. These cookies are not essential to site functionality.

#### Domain Cookies

We use our own domain-specific cookies to store:

*   Session status
*   Login information
*   General site setting preferences, such as language, display preferences, login, and notification status

These cookies are not essential to using LibraryThing overall, but are essential to LibraryThing's "logged in" site functionality. Disabling them may prevent an individual from signing into the service, from seeing the content they want to see, from changing content, etc.

### Analytics

In addition to Google Analytics (above), LibraryThing and TinyCat also collect and analyze their own usage data, to track usage and oversee the Terms of Service.

### Sharing and Transfer of Information

LibraryThing provides Enrichment Services, including LibraryThing for Libraries ([https://www.librarything.com/forlibraries](https://www.librarything.com/forlibraries)) and Syndetics Unbound ([https://proquest.syndetics.com](https://proquest.syndetics.com/)), which dynamically enrich library catalogs and other book sites with data from LibraryThing and LibraryThing members. LibraryThing also provides access to the same information via data feeds.

Our Enrichment Services include aggregate, anonymous and anonymized metadata, such as popularity, average ratings, and tags. No personally-identifiable information is shared with this data.

Our Enrichment Services also include some member-provided reviews. Such sharing includes member names and the content of user reviews. Members can change their settings for the sharing of reviews (see [Privacy Center](https://www.librarything.com/settings/privacy), above), including options to share with no outside entity, with just libraries, or with all entities. Changing these settings in no way affect members' ability to use the site.

Reviews from members who elect to share reviews with all entities may be shared with PowerReviews, a review-aggregation service used by booksellers and retailers. Starting January 15, 2021, this data may include IP addresses, to be used for the sole purpose of PowerReview's fraud- and spam-detection algorithms.

### Third Party Links

LibraryThing may contain links to other sites (such as Amazon, for example). If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site and subjected to their own terms and policies. Note that these external sites are not operated by LibraryThing.

### Security

LibraryThing values your trust in providing us your personal information, thus we are striving to use industry-standard means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and LibraryThing cannot guarantee its absolute security.

#### Protection of Information

We use the following security measures and technologies to protect your data:

*   Industry-standard firewalls
*   Industry-standard encrypted passwords
*   Pseudonymization of select personally-identifiable information
*   Encrypted data transfer over SSL
*   Secure data backups
*   Servers located at secure locked facilities

#### Payment Information

LibraryThing's primary payment process is PayPal. LibraryThing does not receive, process, or store any payment information from PayPal, such as credit card numbers or PayPal receipt numbers.

Members can also pay for LibraryThing services with checks or money orders. We keep this information safe too.

#### Breach of Information

Despite our efforts, no security measure can be absolute, and there can be no guarantee that Your personal information will not be accessed through malicious means, inadvertent disclosure, or mistake.

In the case of a breach of data, as defined in the GDPR, we will notify affected members within 72 hours of our discovery, describing the breach in all appropriate detail, along with our mitigation actions.
