Community Rules
---------------

### Member accounts

Individual accounts are designed for personal collections. Couples and families are fine too. Organizations, like churches, companies, schools, and museums, can also join, with some restrictions. (See [organizational accounts](https://www.librarything.com/organizations).)

In event of dispute, account ownership is determined as follows: If a paid account—from when LibraryThing charged a modest membership fee for accounts with over 200 books—ownership belongs to the party that paid for the membership. For all other accounts, ownership is determined by the email address linked to the account. If there is no email address linked to the account, LibraryThing staff will make a good faith effort to determine ownership. Our decisions are final.

### Social features

#### Freedom of discussion and personal attacks

*   LibraryThing prohibits all personal attacks on members. As [Wikipedia's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_personal_attacks) policy states, "Comment on content, not on the contributor."
*   Personal attacks are attacks on a person. To dispute or disparage someone's words is not a personal attack. It is the line between "You are a liar" and "Your recent post was a lie." The former is a violation of the TOS. The latter is not.
*   Personal attacks include name-calling. Name-calling is not restricted to pure insults (e.g., "asshole"), but also ones that imply both a personal and a content problem (e.g., "liar," "Nazi").
*   LibraryThing has no speech code per se. You can dispute ideas and words without limitation.

#### Good advice

*   Use common sense. Be polite. Think before you post.
*   If you're upset by something or someone, try to calm down before responding.
*   Discussions can become heated and passionate. Don't forget that the person on the other side is human.
*   Remember that LibraryThing Talk is a public space; don't say anything to others that you wouldn't want a room full of people to overhear.
*   Avoid quoting or otherwise exposing private communication. While this does not necessarily violate the Terms of Service, you should consider whether it qualifies as a personal attack or a disclosure of private information.
*   Consider the context before posting. A political or religious dispute does not belong in a knitting group.

#### How to deal with abuse

*   If you come across an abusive post, click the "flag abuse" link. The flag will be visible only after it has been flagged twice. After four different users have flagged a post, it will be deleted.
*   Please do not flag posts as "abuse" simply because you disagree with what is said, or if someone criticizes your favorite book, author, or idea—that's not abuse, it's a difference of opinion. We welcome differences of opinion!
*   LibraryThing staff do not review all flags. Severe abuse should be reported to LibraryThing staff.
*   One violation of the Terms of Service will not be considered to justify another one.
*   Reasonable people can disagree about what constitutes abuse, but flagging is not a weapon. Clear misuse of the flagging feature—either to flag or counter-flag—is itself a manipulation of the system and a violation of the Terms.

#### How LibraryThing deals with abuse

*   As stated, members are encouraged to report abuse, not merely to flag it. Email info@librarything.com.
*   When reporting abuse be as specific as possible.
*   Avoid responding to abuse with abuse. It will not be excused.
*   LibraryThing staff are empowered to admonish, warn, suspend, and ban users for violations of these terms. We are happy to talk things through, but our decisions are final.

#### Other rules

*   LibraryThing is not an advertising medium. Egregious commercial solicitation is forbidden.
*   No matter how great your novel, this _does_ apply to authors. (See [Tips and Guidelines for Authors](http://www.librarything.com/about_authors.php).)
*   Authors caught manipulating the system have had all their books permanently marked with a spam and manipulation warning. You don't want that, believe me.
*   Do not spam member comments or group invitations. Inviting people in your town to a new group is okay; inviting hundreds of members is not.
*   Do not repost flagged content in Talk. If you believed you were flagged unfairly, go ahead and discuss the issue (without getting personal). You can discuss it, with short selections. But you may NOT repost it. If people want to read it, they can; Talk allows you to click something to see the flagged content.
*   Do not create "pointless," "meaningless" or "random" groups or topics. We give all groups the benefit of the doubt, but the creation of multiple, duplicative and contentless groups is against these terms.
*   No personal groups (groups with fewer than two members).
*   Do not intentionally disclose sensitive private information about another member.
*   You may not post any content that violates copyright or other intellectual property law.
*   LibraryThing may not be used for any illegal activity.
*   LibraryThing may not be used to injure, threaten, stalk, impersonate, or harass someone.
*   Do not plagiarize another member's content.
*   Do not upload X-rated or otherwise highly objectionable pictures.
*   Do not upload suggestive images of minors or seeming minors.
*   Your username may not be an insult, either general or specific. Sheesh!
*   We reserve the right to remove accounts with no books after three months. (But we have never done so.)

#### System integrity

*   Do not subvert or misuse site features.
*   Do not set up "shell" or "sock puppet" accounts for any purpose whatsover.
*   Common Knowledge, covers and other core, shared bibliographic data must be edited in good faith.
*   LibraryThing is for _your_ books—books you own, have read or want. It would not be appropriate to fill your LibraryThing catalog with all the books in your local library or Project Gutenberg.
*   Except by permission or through an authorized API, you may not add to or query your library automatically. See our [APIs](http://www.librarything.com/services/).

### Early Reviewers and Member Giveaways

LibraryThing Early Reviewers ("LTER") gives LibraryThing members the chance to receive and review advanced reader editions of upcoming books from select publishers.

LibraryThing Member Giveaways ("LTMG") are an informal way for LibraryThing members and authors to give away books. LTMG reviews may be requested, but not required.

The mailing address and email information you provide for either program will only be used to send you books.

Recipients of books who submit reviews to LibraryThing hereby grant LibraryThing, the book's publisher, and its author perpetual non-exclusive permission to use of the review, together with their first name and city/town of residence, for purposes of entertainment, advertising, promotion, or publicity without additional compensation, except where prohibited by law. LibraryThing, the publisher, and the author reserve the right to edit reviews for clarity or language or to use only excerpts from them. Neither LibraryThing nor the publisher is under any obligation to publish a review.

For more rules and conditions see [your profile](http://www.librarything.com/er/profile).

### Pay-for-review schemes

LibraryThing encourages members to participate in book give-away programs. (LibraryThing has two: [Early Reviewers](http://www.librarything.com/er/list) and [Member Giveaways](http://www.librarything.com/er/giveaway/list).) We forbid reviews from "pay-for-review" schemes.

*   Reviewers must be free to write what they think. They may not be required or rewarded to write positive reviews, or punished for writing bad ones.
*   Reviewers must own and control their reviews, granting other parties only a non-exclusive license.
*   Reviewers must act on their own volition, cross-posting their review when and where they want. Companies that sell services based on how many sites get reviews are explicitly forbidden from using LibraryThing.
*   Reviewers must not be paid for their reviews, except in free books and similar non-monetary perks.

### Member recommendations

In adding a Member recommendation to any given work page, you are expected to make good-faith, disinterested recommendations. You can only make three recommendations per book, and cannot recommend the same book more than five times overall. **Recommending your own book is strictly forbidden.** Members can rate the validity of other member recommendations from the [Rate Recommendations](http://www.librarything.com/profile_raterecommendations.php) page. You are free to recommend books already listed by others or by LibraryThing itself.
