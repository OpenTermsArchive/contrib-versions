When using the Twitch Services, you will be subject to Twitch’s [Community Guidelines](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/community-guidelines/) and additional guidelines or rules that are posted on the Twitch Services, made available to you, or disclosed to you in connection with specific services and features you may be offered. Twitch may also offer certain paid services, which are subject to the [Twitch Terms of Sale](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/terms-of-sale) as well as any additional terms or conditions that are disclosed to you in connection with such services. All such terms and guidelines (the “Guidelines”) are incorporated into these Terms of Service by reference.

You agree that by clicking “Sign Up” or otherwise registering, downloading, accessing, or using the Twitch Services, you are entering into a legally binding agreement between you and Twitch regarding your use of the Twitch Services. You acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these Terms of Service, do not access or otherwise use any of the Twitch Services.

When using Twitch or opening an account with Twitch on behalf of a company, entity, or organization (collectively, “Subscribing Organization”), you represent and warrant that you: (i) are an authorized representative of that Subscribing Organization with the authority to bind that organization to these Terms of Service and grant the licenses set forth herein; and (ii) agree to these Terms of Service on behalf of such Subscribing Organization.

TO THE EXTENT THAT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS LIMITATION OF SUCH LIABILITY, TWITCH SHALL LIMIT ITS LIABILITY TO THE FULL EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

To the extent required by applicable law, nothing in these Terms shall restrict our liability for death or personal injuries caused by Twitch; for damages caused by Twitch’s fraud, willful misconduct, or gross negligence; and for other losses that may not be excluded or limited by applicable law.

ii. Reference Sites

THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY ALSO APPLY WITH RESPECT TO DAMAGES INCURRED BY YOU BY REASON OF ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES SOLD OR PROVIDED ON ANY REFERENCE SITES OR OTHERWISE BY THIRD PARTIES OTHER THAN TWITCH AND RECEIVED THROUGH OR ADVERTISED ON THE TWITCH SERVICES OR RECEIVED THROUGH ANY REFERENCE SITES.

iii. Basis of the Bargain

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT TWITCH HAS OFFERED THE TWITCH SERVICES, USER CONTENT, MATERIALS, AND OTHER CONTENT AND INFORMATION, SET ITS PRICES, AND ENTERED INTO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE IN RELIANCE UPON THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN, THAT THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN REFLECT A REASONABLE AND FAIR ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN YOU AND TWITCH, AND THAT THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN FORM AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN YOU AND TWITCH. TWITCH WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE TWITCH SERVICES TO YOU ON AN ECONOMICALLY REASONABLE BASIS WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS.

##### d. Applicable Law and Venue

(i) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you and Twitch agree that if you are a Subscribing Organization or a consumer resident of a jurisdiction other than those in (ii) and (iii) below, the following governing law and arbitration provision applies:

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH TWITCH AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM TWITCH.

(a) You and Twitch agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms of Service or your use of the Twitch Services, except that you and Twitch are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable and other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents. ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL. You and Twitch agree that you will notify each other in writing of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises. Notice to Twitch shall be sent to: Twitch Interactive, Inc., Attn: Legal, 350 Bush Street, 2nd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94104. You and Twitch further agree: to attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration; that any arbitration will occur in Santa Clara County, California; that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS; and that the state or federal courts in Santa Clara County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration. Other than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.

(b) Any dispute between the parties will be governed by this Agreement and the laws of the State of California and applicable United States law, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.

(c) Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you and Twitch will not commence against the other a class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding.

(ii) For residents of the European Union or the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland who are acting as a Consumer, these Terms of Service and any disputes, claims, or causes of action arising out of or in connection with them will be governed by the laws of the State of California and applicable United States law, provided that this choice of governing law will not deprive you of the protection afforded to you by provisions that cannot be derogated from by agreement by virtue of the laws applicable where you habitually reside. In such cases, disputes shall be resolved in the competent civil courts as determined by applicable law.

(iii) If you are a resident in any jurisdiction other than those named in (ii) in which the arbitration provision in the section (i)(a) above is found to be unenforceable, then any disputes, claims, or causes of action arising out of or in connection with these Terms of Service shall be brought and resolved by the state or federal courts in San Francisco County, California or, if required by applicable law, then by competent civil courts within your jurisdiction of residence. If the governing law provision in (i)(b) is found to be unenforceable, then the laws of your jurisdiction of residence shall govern.

##### e. Claims

TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND TWITCH AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE TWITCH SERVICES MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.

#### 20\. Miscellaneous

##### **a. Waiver**

If we fail to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service, it will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms of Service will be effective only if in writing and signed by the relevant party.

##### **b. Severability**

If any provision of these Terms of Service is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated from these Terms of Service to the minimum extent necessary and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

##### **c. Assignment**

To the extent permitted by applicable law, these Terms of Service, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Twitch without restriction. Any assignment attempted to be made in violation of this Terms of Service shall be void.

##### **d. Survival**

Upon termination of these Terms of Service, any provision which, by its nature or express terms should survive, will survive such termination or expiration, including, but not limited to, Sections 7-10, 14, and 16-19.

##### **e. Entire Agreement**
