#### 1\. Introduction; Your Agreement to these Terms of Service

PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY. THIS IS A BINDING CONTRACT. Welcome to the services operated by Twitch Interactive, Inc. (collectively with its affiliates, “Twitch” or “We”) consisting of the website available at https://www.twitch.tv, and its network of websites, software applications, or any other products or services offered by Twitch (the “Twitch Services”). Other services offered by Twitch may be subject to separate terms.

When using the Twitch Services, you will be subject to Twitch’s [Community Guidelines](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/community-guidelines/) and additional guidelines or rules that are posted on the Twitch Services, made available to you, or disclosed to you in connection with specific services and features. Twitch may also offer certain paid services, which are subject to the [Twitch Terms of Sale](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/terms-of-sale) as well as any additional terms or conditions that are disclosed to you in connection with such services. All such terms and guidelines (the “Guidelines”) are incorporated into these Terms of Service by reference.

The Terms of Service apply whether you are a user that registers an account with the Twitch Services or an unregistered user. You agree that by clicking “Sign Up” or otherwise registering, downloading, accessing, or using the Twitch Services, you are entering into a legally binding agreement between you and Twitch regarding your use of the Twitch Services. You acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these Terms of Service, do not access or otherwise use any of the Twitch Services.

The Twitch Services are also not available to any users previously removed from the Twitch Services by Twitch or to any persons barred from receiving them under the laws of the United States (such as its export and re-export restrictions and regulations) or applicable laws in any other jurisdiction.

BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR OTHERWISE USING THE TWITCH SERVICES, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE AT LEAST 13 YEARS OF AGE, THAT YOUR PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN AGREES TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF SERVICE IF YOU ARE BETWEEN 13 AND THE AGE OF LEGAL MAJORITY IN YOUR JURISDICTION OF RESIDENCE, AND THAT YOU HAVE NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY REMOVED FROM AND ARE NOT PROHIBITED FROM RECEIVING THE TWITCH SERVICES.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT TWITCH HAS OFFERED THE TWITCH SERVICES, USER CONTENT, MATERIALS, AND OTHER CONTENT AND INFORMATION, SET ITS PRICES, AND ENTERED INTO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE IN RELIANCE UPON THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN, THAT THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN REFLECT A REASONABLE AND FAIR ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN YOU AND TWITCH, AND THAT THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN FORM AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN YOU AND TWITCH. TWITCH WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE TWITCH SERVICES TO YOU ON AN ECONOMICALLY REASONABLE BASIS WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS.

**d. Applicable Law and Venue**

(i) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you and Twitch agree that if you are a Subscribing Organization or a consumer resident of a jurisdiction other than those in (ii) below, the following governing law and arbitration provision applies:

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH TWITCH AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM TWITCH.

You and Twitch agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms of Service or your use of the Twitch Services, except that you and Twitch are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable and other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents. ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL. You and Twitch agree that you will notify each other in writing of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises. Notice to Twitch shall be sent to: Twitch Interactive, Inc., Attn: Legal, 350 Bush Street, 2nd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94104. You and Twitch further agree: to attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration; that any arbitration will occur in Santa Clara County, California; that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS; and that the state or federal courts in Santa Clara County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration. Other than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court. Any dispute between the parties will be governed by this Agreement and the laws of the State of California and applicable United States law, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction. Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you and Twitch will not commence against the other a class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding.

#### 18\. Specific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch

Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music. By downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service. Twitch’s [Community Guidelines](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/community-guidelines/) and [Music Guidelines](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/community-guidelines/music/) apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.

Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming. To make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists. Twitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.

The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel. Music and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services. What this means is that you may not:

*   Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack – we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music; or
*   Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.

Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.

Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time. Thus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws). Twitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.
