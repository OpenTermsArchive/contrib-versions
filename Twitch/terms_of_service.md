#### 1\. Introduction; Your Agreement to these Terms of Service

PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY. THIS IS A BINDING CONTRACT. Welcome to the services operated by Twitch Interactive, Inc. (collectively with its affiliates, “Twitch” or “We”) consisting of the website available at https://www.twitch.tv, and its network of websites, software applications, or any other products or services offered by Twitch (the “Twitch Services”). Other services offered by Twitch may be subject to separate terms.

When using the Twitch Services, you will be subject to Twitch’s [Community](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/community-guidelines/) [Guidelines](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/community-guidelines/) and additional guidelines or rules that are posted on the Twitch Services, made available to you, or disclosed to you in connection with specific services and features. Twitch may also offer certain paid services, which are subject to the [Twitch Terms of Sale](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/terms-of-sale) as well as any additional terms or conditions that are disclosed to you in connection with such services. All such terms and guidelines (the "Guidelines") are incorporated into these Terms of Service by reference.

The Terms of Service apply whether you are a user that registers an account with the Twitch Services or an unregistered user. You agree that by clicking “Sign Up” or otherwise registering, downloading, accessing, or using the Twitch Services, you are entering into a legally binding agreement between you and Twitch regarding your use of the Twitch Services. You acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these Terms of Service, do not access or otherwise use any of the Twitch Services.

When using Twitch or opening an account with Twitch on behalf of a company, entity, or organization (collectively, “Subscribing Organization”), you represent and warrant that you: (i) are an authorized representative of that Subscribing Organization with the authority to bind that organization to these Terms of Service and grant the licenses set forth herein; and (ii) agree to these Terms of Service on behalf of such Subscribing Organization.

The Twitch Services are also not available to any users previously removed from the Twitch Services by Twitch or to any persons barred from receiving them under the laws of the United States (such as its export and re-export restrictions and regulations) or applicable laws in any other jurisdiction.

BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR OTHERWISE USING THE TWITCH SERVICES, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE AT LEAST 13 YEARS OF AGE, THAT YOUR PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN AGREES TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF SERVICE IF YOU ARE BETWEEN 13 AND THE AGE OF LEGAL MAJORITY IN YOUR JURISDICTION OF RESIDENCE, AND THAT YOU HAVE NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY REMOVED FROM AND ARE NOT PROHIBITED FROM RECEIVING THE TWITCH SERVICES.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT TWITCH HAS OFFERED THE TWITCH SERVICES, USER CONTENT, MATERIALS, AND OTHER CONTENT AND INFORMATION, SET ITS PRICES, AND ENTERED INTO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE IN RELIANCE UPON THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN, THAT THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN REFLECT A REASONABLE AND FAIR ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN YOU AND TWITCH, AND THAT THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN FORM AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN YOU AND TWITCH. TWITCH WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE TWITCH SERVICES TO YOU ON AN ECONOMICALLY REASONABLE BASIS WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS.

**d. Applicable Law and Venue**

(i) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you and Twitch agree that if you are a Subscribing Organization or a consumer resident of a jurisdiction other than those in (ii) below, the following governing law and arbitration provision applies:

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH TWITCH AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM TWITCH.

You and Twitch agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms of Service or your use of the Twitch Services, except that you and Twitch are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable and other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents. ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL. You and Twitch agree that you will notify each other in writing of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises. Notice to Twitch shall be sent to: Twitch Interactive, Inc., Attn: Legal, 350 Bush Street, 2nd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94104. You and Twitch further agree: to attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration; that any arbitration will occur in Santa Clara County, California; that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS; and that the state or federal courts in Santa Clara County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration. Other than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court. Any dispute between the parties will be governed by this Agreement and the laws of the State of California and applicable United States law, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction. Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you and Twitch will not commence against the other a class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding.

#### 18\. Specific Terms for Twitch Sings

Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool. It allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings. All game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.

Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.  Bonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.

Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:

*   Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;
*   Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings; and
*   Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).  Conduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.

To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.  The licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services. Twitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services. What this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:

*   make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);
*   assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings; or
*   use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.  However, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.

Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents. 

Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.  Thus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws). This may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances. Twitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.
