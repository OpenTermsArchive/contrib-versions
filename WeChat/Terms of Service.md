WECHAT – TERMS OF SERVICE
=========================

INTRODUCTION
------------

Welcome to WeChat!

Your use of WeChat is subject to these Terms of Service (these "**Terms**"). Thank you for reviewing these Terms – we hope you enjoy using WeChat.

If you have any questions about, or if you wish to send us any notices in relation to, these Terms, please contact us by going to “Me” -> “Settings” -> “Help & Feedback” from within WeChat or by visiting [help.wechat.com](https://help.wechat.com/).

_Compliance with these Terms_

By using WeChat, you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms between you and:

| **International Dialling Code of the Phone Number Linked to your Account** | **Contracting Entity** | **Address** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| If the international dialling code of the phone number linked to your account is in any country other than the UK, EEA or Switzerland (as defined below) or People’s Republic of China (excluding Taiwan, Hong Kong or Macau) (“**China Mainland**”) | **WeChat International Pte. Ltd.** | 10 Anson Road, #21-07 International Plaza, Singapore 079903 |
| If the international dialling code of the phone number linked to your account is in United Kingdom, European Economic Area or Switzerland (“**UK, EEA or Switzerland**”) | **Tencent International Services Europe BV** | Gustav Mahlerplein 2, 1082 MA Amsterdam, the Netherlands |

(in each case, “**we**”, “**our**” and “**us**”).

We may specify in certain of our WeChat service-specific terms that you are contracting with one of our affiliate companies (instead of **WeChat International Pte. Ltd.** or **Tencent International Services Europe BV**, as applicable) in relation to your use of the relevant WeChat service or feature to which the relevant service-specific terms apply. Where this is the case, the relevant contracting entity will be identified in the relevant WeChat service-specific terms. These Terms (including those relevant service-specific terms) will apply between you and that identified contracting entity in relation to your use of the relevant WeChat service or feature.

_Other Users_

**These Terms only apply to you if you are a WeChat user, meaning that you have registered by linking a mobile number that uses international dialling codes other than +86 (a “non-China Mainland mobile number”).**

**These Terms do not apply to you if you are a Weixin user. You are a Weixin user if you either:**

*   **register by linking a mobile number that uses international dialling code +86 (i.e., a “China Mainland mobile number”); or**
*   **have contracted with 深圳市腾讯计算机系统有限公司 (Shenzhen Tencent Computer Systems Company Limited) for Weixin.**

**If you are a Weixin user, you are subject to the Weixin** [**Agreement on Software License and Service of Tencent Weixin**](https://weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/readtemplate?lang=en_US&t=weixin_agreement&s=default&cc=CN) (the “**Weixin Terms of Service**”) **and not to these Terms.**

You can also check whether you are a WeChat or Weixin user by clicking “Me” > “Settings” > “About” and then clicking the link to the “Terms of Service”. If you see the _WeChat – Terms of Service_ then you are a WeChat user. If you see the _Agreement on Software License and Service of Tencent Weixin_ then you are a Weixin user.

If there is a subsequent change in the international dialling code of the phone number linked to your WeChat or Weixin account (either from a China Mainland mobile number to a non-China Mainland mobile number, or vice versa), your account will be converted to either a WeChat or Weixin account (as the case may be), and you will be prompted to agree to the corresponding terms of service (either for WeChat or Weixin, as the case may be). You shall also be subject to, and shall abide by, any relevant laws and regulations that apply to the use of the new account (which may different to those that applied prior to the conversion). If you convert your Weixin account to a WeChat account, these Terms apply to you from the date our system records such conversion. If you convert your WeChat account to a Weixin account, these Terms cease to apply to you from the date our system records such conversion. This function is intended to ensure we provide you with the features and services that are most relevant to your account. Any conversion shall also be in accordance with these Terms and any other applicable platform rules and regulations, and accounts which attempt to abuse this function (for example, by frequent switching) may have their access restricted in accordance with these Terms.

**INTEROPERABILITY WITH WEIXIN**

WeChat is interoperable with Weixin, such that you are able to communicate with Weixin users and view each other’s Moments and Status. You may also be able to use certain features operated by Weixin. Use of those features is subject to the relevant [Weixin Terms of Service](https://weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/readtemplate?lang=en_US&t=weixin_agreement&s=default&cc=CN) or service agreement applicable to such feature. For more details, please see [below](#Interoperability_with_Weixin).

_These Terms_

In some countries, there are restrictions on your use of WeChat – it is your responsibility to ensure that you are legally allowed to use WeChat where you are located, and certain WeChat functionalities may not be available in some countries.

**By using WeChat, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use WeChat.**

_Other general terms in relation to these Terms_

If you are under the age of 13, you must not use WeChat. If you are between the ages of 13 and 18 (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction where you are considered a minor), your parent or guardian must agree to these Terms (both for themselves and on your behalf) before you can use WeChat.

We comply with the provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act applicable to Internet service providers (17 U.S.C. §512, as amended) (the "**DMCA**"). If you have an intellectual property rights-related complaint about any content posted in WeChat, please follow the instructions set out in our [Copyright Policy](https://www.tencent.com/legal/html/en-us/complaint.html).

### THIRD PARTY CONTENT AND SERVICES

_General_

When you use WeChat you may be able to access content from a variety of sources – it may be content posted by other users of WeChat, content provided by third parties that operate Weixin Official Accounts or Mini Programs, content you see in advertisements prepared by third parties, or any other third party content made available or accessible when using WeChat (together we refer to all of this content as “**Third-Party Content**”).

All Third-Party Content must comply with our policies, as well as applicable laws and regulations. If we receive a complaint, or become aware of a concern, regarding Third-Party Content, then we may review that Third-Party Content. We may take action to ensure the Third-Party Content complies with our policies, or if it is considered to have violated our policies, we may remove or refuse to make available or link to it. This may be, for example, if the Third-Party Content is considered by us, or is alleged, to infringe intellectual property rights, is determined to be obscene, defamatory or abusive, if it violates any rights, or if it poses any risk to the security or performance of WeChat.

You should remain vigilant when accessing, using or consuming Third-Party Content. We cannot review all Third-Party Content prior to it being posted, so if you believe any Third-Party Content is inaccurate, misleading, defamatory, offensive or unlawful please let us know immediately. Please also remember that Third-Party Content, as well as any other information or content accessible via WeChat that is not posted by you, may be owned by a third party, and just because you have accessed content on WeChat does not mean you have any rights in or to any such content. You should always respect the rights of others when using WeChat – if you would like to use content in a particular way you should always seek permission from the relevant rights holder.

The WeChat platform also provides access to a variety of third party products and services – such as Mini Programs made available on the Weixin Mini Programs Platform; Official Accounts; websites provided, made available, advertised or linked through WeChat (including any of WeChat's associated platforms or services); and other products and services offered or advertised by third parties. These products, services and websites are operated by third parties, so we are unable to guarantee their quality, reliability or suitability. If you use or interact with these third party offerings then you should direct any questions, complaints or queries to the relevant third party who operates that offering, as we bear no responsibility for your use of those offerings, or any relationship you may enter into with any such third parties (including any payment obligations or fees that you may incur in your use of such third party offerings).

Offerings made available by third parties, or Third-Party Content, may also be subject to further terms from that third party – for example, terms from the relevant third party that originally produced or created such content or service, terms in relation to promotional activities being held on WeChat, terms relating to your use of third party-provided WeChat login functionality, or terms governing your use of any Mini Programs provided by a third party. You are solely responsible for reviewing and complying with any such third party terms and conditions.

We have the right to remove, at our sole discretion and without notice to you, any content, programs and/or services that are made available within WeChat (including any of WeChat's associated platforms or services), in accordance with these Terms.

_Interoperability with Weixin_

WeChat is interoperable with Weixin, such that you are able to communicate with Weixin users and view each other’s Moments and Status. You may also be able to use certain features operated by Weixin. You may view the list of features operated by Weixin [**here**](https://www.wechat.com/en/weixin_features.html). Please note that when you interact with a Weixin user, or use any features operated by Weixin, the Weixin users you interact with are not subject to these Terms, and instead are subject to the [_Weixin Terms of Service_](https://weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/readtemplate?lang=en_US&t=weixin_agreement&s=default&cc=CN) meaning that what you have shared with Weixin users may be retained, shared or stored by Weixin in a different manner to what is described in these Terms or the [_WeChat Privacy Policy_](https://www.wechat.com/en/privacy_policy.html). You can read about how Weixin operates, and how Weixin retains, shares and stores information, in the [_Weixin Terms of Service_](https://weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/readtemplate?lang=en_US&t=weixin_agreement&s=default&cc=CN) and the [_Weixin Privacy Protection Guidelines_](https://weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/readtemplate?lang=en_US&t=weixin_agreement&s=privacy&cc=CN).

When you interact with such Official Accounts and Mini Programs, your use of the relevant Official Accounts and Mini Programs will be subject to those third party developer’s own terms for the relevant Official Account or Mini Program and not these Terms.

_Weixin Pay_

If you are a Weixin Pay user, you may be able to access Weixin Pay via the WeChat platform. Weixin Pay is operated by a China Mainland licensed entity and the use of Weixin Pay service is subject to the [_Weixin Pay User Service Agreement_](https://weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/readtemplate?uin=&stype=&promote=&fr=&lang=en_US&ADTAG=&check=false&nav=faq&t=weixin_agreement&s=pay).

### TERMINATION

These Terms will apply to your use of WeChat until your access to WeChat is terminated by either you or us.

You may terminate your use of WeChat, or any of the services accessible therein, at any time (including if we have told you about an upcoming change to all or part of WeChat or these Terms which you do not agree to). If the terminated service is a paid service, we may deduct from any refund a reasonable proportion of such fee as compensation for the costs incurred by us in ending the relevant service.

We may suspend or terminate your access to your account or any or all of WeChat:

*   if we undertake maintenance or support of WeChat;
*   to make changes to WeChat as notified by us to you;
*   if we reasonably believe that you have breached these Terms;
*   if your use of WeChat creates risk for us or for other users of WeChat, gives rise to a threat of potential third party claims against us or is potentially damaging to our reputation;
*   if you fail to use WeChat for a prolonged period;
*   if such suspension or termination is required due to applicable laws; or
*   to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations, for any other reason in our sole and absolute discretion,

and where reasonably practicable, we will give you advance notice of any suspension or termination.

If we suspend your access to any or all of WeChat then, to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction:

*   a. you remain responsible for all fees accrued through the date of suspension (including where the fees were incurred before suspension date but performance of the relevant obligations were after the suspension date); and
*   b. you remain responsible for any applicable fees for any part of WeChat to which you continue to have access.

If your access to WeChat is terminated (in whole or in part) by you or us, you agree that:

*   a. all of your rights under these Terms will terminate;
*   b. you remain responsible for all fees accrued through the date of termination (including where the fees were incurred before termination date but performance of the relevant obligations were after the termination date); and
*   c. you will immediately permanently delete all copies of WeChat Software to which the termination relates and you will immediately cease accessing and using any such WeChat Software.

Subject to the [WeChat Privacy Policy](https://www.wechat.com/en/privacy_policy.html) and applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction, where we suspend or terminate all or part of WeChat, or where your access to WeChat is terminated by you or us, we do not guarantee that we will be able to return any of Your Content back to you and we may permanently delete Your Content without notice to you at any time after termination.

### GENERAL

Subject to the applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction, these Terms sets out the entire agreement between you and us in relation to WeChat – you agree that you will have no claim against us for any statement which is not explicitly set out in these Terms. The words "include" and "including" are to be construed without limitation. The invalidity of any provision of these Terms (or parts of any provision) will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision (or the remaining parts of that provision). If a court holds that we cannot enforce any part of these Terms as drafted, we may replace those terms with similar terms to the extent enforceable under applicable laws and regulations, without changing the remaining terms of these Terms. No delay in enforcing any provision of these Terms will be construed to be a waiver of any rights under that provision. Any rights and obligations under these Terms which by their nature should survive, including any obligations in relation to the liability of, or indemnities (if any) given by, the respective parties, will remain in effect after termination or expiration of these Terms.

No person other than you and us will have any right to enforce these Terms, whether pursuant to the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 2001 (Chapter 53B) of Singapore or otherwise, and you may not delegate, assign or transfer these Terms or any rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior consent. We may freely assign or transfer these Terms or our rights and obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, without your prior consent or prior notice to you. We may freely sub-contract any part of our performance of these Terms at any time, without your prior consent or prior notice to you.

### GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION

Except to the extent that:

*   a. any applicable additional terms incorporated into these Terms provide differently, or
    
*   b. the applicable laws and regulations of your jurisdiction mandate otherwise (for example, you may have statutory rights in your jurisdiction in relation to bringing or defending claims in a local court (including small claims court)):
    
*   these Terms and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with these Terms will be governed by the law of Singapore; and
    
*   any dispute, controversy or claim (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of, relating to, or in connection with these Terms, including their existence, validity, interpretation, performance, breach or termination, will be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre under the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre in force when the Notice of Arbitration is submitted. The seat of the arbitration will be Singapore. There will be one arbitrator only. The arbitration proceedings will be conducted in English.
    

### WECHAT TERMS OF SERVICE (USA-SPECIFIC TERMS)

_If you are a user of WeChat in the USA, the below Additional Terms: (a) are incorporated into these Terms; (b) apply to your use of WeChat; and (c) override the head terms of these Terms to the extent of any inconsistency._

If you are a user of WeChat in the United States of America, the following terms expressly replaces the above "Governing Law and Dispute Resolution" section of these Terms.

If you live in (or, if a business, your principal place of business is in) the United States, the laws of the state where you live govern all claims, regardless of conflict of law principles, except that the Federal Arbitration Act governs all provisions relating to arbitration. You and we irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state or federal courts of California, for all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms that are heard in court (excluding arbitration).

EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

In the event of a dispute, you and we agree to try for sixty (60) days to resolve it informally. If you and we are unable to come to informal resolution within sixty (60) days, you and we agree to binding individual arbitration before the American Arbitration Association ("**AAA**") under the Federal Arbitration Act ("**FAA**") (with such arbitration to be conducted under the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules), and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury. Instead, a neutral arbitrator will decide and the arbitrator’s decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the FAA. Class action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations, private attorney-general actions, and any other proceeding where someone acts in a representative capacity are not allowed, and nor is combining individual proceedings without the consent of all parties. These Terms govern to the extent they conflict with the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules or Consumer Arbitration Rules. You and we must file in arbitration any claim or dispute (except intellectual property disputes) within one year from when it first could be filed. If the class action waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then those parts won’t be arbitrated but will proceed in court, with the rest proceeding in arbitration. If any other provision of these provisions regarding arbitration is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed but the rest of these provisions regarding arbitration still apply.

If you are a California resident, then (except to the extent prohibited by applicable laws) you agree to waive California Civil Code Section 1542, and any similar provision in any other jurisdiction (if you are a resident of such other jurisdiction), which states: "A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party”.

### WECHAT TERMS OF SERVICE (AUSTRALIA-SPECIFIC TERMS)

_If you are a user of WeChat in Australia, the below Additional Terms: (a) are incorporated into these Terms; (b) apply to your use of WeChat; and (c) override the head terms of these Terms to the extent of any inconsistency._

Nothing in these Terms excludes, restricts or modifies any guarantee, warranty, term or condition, right or remedy implied or imposed by any applicable laws and regulations which cannot lawfully be excluded, restricted or modified.

If any guarantee, condition, warranty or term is implied or imposed by any applicable laws and regulations and cannot be excluded (a “**Non-Excludable Provision**”), and we are able to limit your remedy for a breach of the Non-Excludable Provision, then our liability for breach of the Non-Excludable Provision is limited to one or more of the following at our option:

*   in the case of goods, the replacement of the goods or the supply of equivalent goods, the repair of the goods, the payment of the cost of replacing the goods or of acquiring equivalent goods, or the payment of the cost of having the goods repaired; or
*   in the case of services, the supplying of the services again, or the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again.

_Refund of your purchases_

If you have purchased and paid for a WeChat product or service provided by us (and not by any third parties), you may receive a refund for such purchase if we receive a refund request from you within 14 days from the date you completed the relevant purchase. If you have already used a portion of the relevant product or service, you will receive a refund for the unused portion only. In the case of a download or streaming product, you acknowledge that by proceeding to download or stream such product, you will not be entitled to a refund of such purchase.

You can also file a complaint at the online platform for alternative dispute resolution (ODR-platform). You can find the ODR-platform through the following link: [https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr).

_Loss or damage_

If any WeChat services or features which we have supplied damages a device or digital content belonging to you and this is caused by our failure to use reasonable care and skill we will either repair the damage or pay you reasonable compensation for such damage. However, we will not be liable for damage which you could have avoided by following our advice to apply an update offered to you free of charge or for damage which was caused by you failing to correctly follow installation instructions or to have in place the minimum system requirements advised by us. We only supply WeChat and the services or features accessible via WeChat for domestic and private use. If you use WeChat or the services or features for any commercial or business purpose we will have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity.
