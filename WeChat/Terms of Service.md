1\. INTRODUCTION
----------------

Welcome to WeChat!

Your use of WeChat is subject to these Terms of Service (these "**Terms**"). Thank you for reviewing these Terms – we hope you enjoy using WeChat. If you have any questions about, or if you wish to send us any notices in relation to, these Terms, please contact us by going to “Me” -> “Settings” -> “Help & Feedback” from within WeChat or by visiting [help.wechat.com](https://help.wechat.com/).

_Compliance with These Terms_

By using WeChat, you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms between you and:

| **International Dialling Code of the Phone Number Linked to your Account** | **Contracting Entity** | **Address** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| If the international dialling code of the phone number linked to your account is in any country other than the UK, EEA or Switzerland (as defined below) or People's Republic of China (excluding Taiwan, Hong Kong or Macao) (“**China Mainland**”) | **WeChat International Pte. Ltd.** | 10 Anson Road, #21-07 International Plaza, Singapore 079903 |
| If the international dialling code of the phone number linked to your account is in United Kingdom, European Economic Area or Switzerland (“**UK, EEA or Switzerland**”) | **Tencent International Services Europe BV** | Buitenveldertselaan 1-5, 1082 VA Amsterdam, the Netherlands |

(in each case, “**we**”, “**our**” and “**us**”).

We may specify in certain of our WeChat service-specific terms that you are contracting with one of our affiliate companies (instead of **WeChat International Pte. Ltd.** or **Tencent International Services Europe BV**, as applicable) in relation to your use of the relevant WeChat service or feature to which the relevant service-specific terms apply. Where this is the case, the relevant contracting entity will be identified in the relevant WeChat service-specific terms. These Terms (including those relevant service-specific terms) will apply between you and that identified contracting entity in relation to your use of the relevant WeChat service or feature. Please review these Terms and our policies and instructions to understand how you can and cannot use WeChat. You must comply with these Terms in your use of WeChat and only use WeChat as permitted by applicable laws and regulations, wherever you may be when you use them. In some countries, there are restrictions on your use of WeChat – it is your responsibility to ensure that you are legally allowed to use WeChat where you are located, and certain WeChat functionalities may not be available in some countries.

**By using WeChat, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use WeChat.**

> **These Terms contain provisions governing how claims can be brought between you and us (see Section 18 and Schedules 1 and 3 of the Addendum below). If you are a WeChat user residing in the United States, Schedule 1 of the Addendum below, entitled “United States-Specific Terms,” requires you to resolve all disputes with us on an individual basis and, with limited exceptions, through final and binding arbitration, _rather than in court. Schedule 1 of the Addendum also explains how you can opt out of this arbitration agreement in some circumstances._ Please read these provisions carefully.**

_Other Users_

**These Terms only apply to you if you are a WeChat user, meaning that you have registered by linking a mobile number that uses international dialling codes other than +86 (a “non-China Mainland mobile number”).**

**These Terms do not apply to you if you are a Weixin user. You are a Weixin user if you either:**

*   **register by linking a mobile number that uses international dialling code +86 (i.e., a “China Mainland mobile number”); or**
*   **have contracted with 深圳市腾讯计算机系统有限公司 (Shenzhen Tencent Computer Systems Company Limited) for Weixin.**

**If you are a Weixin user, you are subject to the Weixin** [**Agreement on Software License and Service of Tencent Weixin**](https://weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/readtemplate?lang=en_US&t=weixin_agreement&s=default&cc=CN) (the “**Weixin Terms of Service**”) **and not to these Terms.**

You can also check whether you are a WeChat or Weixin user by clicking “Me” > “Settings” > “About” and then clicking the link to the “Terms of Service”. If you see the _WeChat – Terms of Service_ then you are a WeChat user. If you see the _Agreement on Software License and Service of Tencent Weixin_ then you are a Weixin user.

If there is a subsequent change in the international dialling code of the phone number linked to your WeChat or Weixin account (either from a China Mainland mobile number to a non-China Mainland mobile number, or vice versa), your account will be converted to either a WeChat or Weixin account (as the case may be), and you will be prompted to agree to the corresponding terms of service (either for WeChat or Weixin, as the case may be). You shall also be subject to, and shall abide by, any relevant laws and regulations that apply to the use of the new account (which may be different from those that applied prior to the conversion). If you convert your Weixin account to a WeChat account, these Terms apply to you from the date our system records such conversion. If you convert your WeChat account to a Weixin account, these Terms cease to apply to you from the date our system records such conversion. This function is intended to ensure we provide you with the features and services that are most relevant to your account. Any conversion shall also be in accordance with these Terms and any other applicable platform rules and regulations, and accounts which attempt to abuse this function (for example, by frequent switching) may have their access restricted in accordance with these Terms.

**INTEROPERABILITY WITH WEIXIN**

WeChat is interoperable with Weixin, such that you are able to communicate with Weixin users and view each other's Moments and Status in accordance with the applicable terms. You may also be able to use certain features operated by Weixin. Use of those features is subject to the relevant [Weixin Terms of Service](https://weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/readtemplate?lang=en_US&t=weixin_agreement&s=default&cc=CN) or service agreement applicable to such feature. For more details, please see [below](#Interoperability_with_Weixin).

_Other General Terms in Relation to These Terms_

If you are under the age of 13 (or such applicable legal minimum age in your jurisdiction), you must not use WeChat for any purpose without first obtaining your parent or guardian’s agreement to these Terms (both for themselves and on your behalf).

If you are using WeChat on behalf of a company, partnership, association, government or other organisation (your “**Organisation**”), you warrant that you are authorised to do so and that you are authorised to bind your Organisation to these Terms. In such circumstances, “you” will include your Organisation.

We may translate these Terms into multiple languages. If there is any difference between the English version and any other language version of these Terms, the English version will apply (to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations).

From time to time, certain products or services within WeChat may be subject to payment (including for the provision of WeChat or provision of certain additional features within WeChat).

7\. INFRINGEMENT OF RIGHTS
--------------------------

We comply with the provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act applicable to Internet service providers (17 U.S.C. §512, as amended) (the "**DMCA**"). If you have an intellectual property rights-related complaint about any content posted in WeChat, please follow the instructions set out in our [Copyright Policy](https://www.tencent.com/legal/html/en-us/complaint.html).

8\. THIRD-PARTY CONTENT AND SERVICES
------------------------------------

_General_

When you use WeChat you may be able to access content from a variety of sources – it may be content posted by other users of WeChat, content provided by third parties that operate Weixin Official Accounts or Mini Programs, content you see in advertisements prepared by third parties, or any other third-party content made available or accessible when using WeChat (together we refer to all of this content as “**Third-Party Content**”).

All Third-Party Content must comply with our policies, as well as applicable laws and regulations. If we receive a complaint, or become aware of a concern, regarding Third-Party Content, then we may review that Third-Party Content. We may take action to ensure the Third-Party Content complies with our policies, or if it is considered to have violated our policies, we may remove or refuse to make available or link to it. This may be, for example, if the Third-Party Content is considered by us, or is alleged, to infringe intellectual property rights, is determined to be obscene, defamatory or abusive, if it violates any rights, or if it poses any risk to the security or performance of WeChat.

You should remain vigilant when accessing, using or consuming Third-Party Content. We cannot review all Third-Party Content prior to it being posted, so if you believe any Third-Party Content is inaccurate, misleading, defamatory, offensive or unlawful please let us know immediately. Please also remember that Third-Party Content, as well as any other information or content accessible via WeChat that is not posted by you, may be owned by a third-party, and just because you have accessed content on WeChat does not mean you have any rights in or to any such content. You should always respect the rights of others when using WeChat – if you would like to use content in a particular way you should always seek permission from the relevant rights holder.

The WeChat platform also provides access to a variety of third-party products and services – such as Mini Programs made available on the Weixin Mini Programs Platform; Official Accounts; Service Accounts; websites provided, made available, advertised or linked through WeChat (including any of WeChat's associated platforms or services); and other products and services offered or advertised by third parties. These products, services and websites are operated by third parties, so we are unable to guarantee their quality, reliability or suitability. If you use or interact with these third-party offerings then you should direct any questions, complaints or queries to the relevant third-party who operates that offering, as we bear no responsibility for your use of those offerings, or any relationship you may enter into with any such third parties (including any payment obligations or fees that you may incur in your use of such third-party offerings).

Offerings made available by third parties, or Third-Party Content, may also be subject to further terms from that third-party – for example, terms from the relevant third-party that originally produced or created such content or service, terms in relation to promotional activities being held on WeChat, terms relating to your use of third-party-provided WeChat login functionality, or terms governing your use of any Mini Programs provided by a third-party. You are solely responsible for reviewing and complying with any such third-party terms and conditions.

We have the right to remove, at our sole discretion and without notice to you, any content, programs and/or services that are made available within WeChat (including any of WeChat's associated platforms or services), in accordance with these Terms.

_Interoperability with Weixin_

WeChat is interoperable with Weixin, such that you are able to communicate with Weixin users and view each other's Moments and Status in accordance with the applicable terms. You may also be able to use certain features operated by Weixin. You may view the list of features operated by Weixin [**here**](https://www.wechat.com/en/weixin_features.html). Please note that when you interact with a Weixin user, or use or receive notifications from any feature operated by Weixin (together **"Interoperable Interaction"**), the Weixin users you interact with are not subject to these Terms, and instead are subject to the [_Weixin Terms of Service_](https://weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/readtemplate?lang=en_US&t=weixin_agreement&s=default&cc=CN) and the [_Standards of Weixin Account Usage_](https://weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/readtemplate?&t=page/agreement/personal_account&lang=en_US) meaning that we will share your information with Weixin to the extent necessary to facilitate your Interoperable Interaction and your information may be retained, shared and/or stored by Weixin in a different manner to what is described in these Terms or the [_WeChat Privacy Policy_](https://www.wechat.com/en/privacy_policy.html). You can read about how Weixin operates, and how Weixin retains, shares and stores information, in the [_Weixin Terms of Service_](https://weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/readtemplate?lang=en_US&t=weixin_agreement&s=default&cc=CN) and the [_Weixin Privacy Protection Guidelines_](https://weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/readtemplate?lang=en_US&t=weixin_agreement&s=privacy&cc=CN). In addition, if your interaction with Weixin users potentially causes such Weixin users to violate the [_Weixin Terms of Service_](https://weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/readtemplate?lang=en_US&t=weixin_agreement&s=default&cc=CN), [_Standards of Weixin Account Usage_](https://weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/readtemplate?&t=page/agreement/personal_account&lang=en_US) and any other applicable laws and regulations, Weixin may at its discretion, restrict or limit the interoperability of Weixin with WeChat, including restricting or limiting Weixin users from interacting with WeChat users.

_Weixin Official Accounts, Service Accounts and Mini Programs_

The Weixin Official Account, Service Account and Weixin Mini Program functions accessible via WeChat are China Mainland services provided by Weixin. The content in such Official Accounts, Service Accounts and Mini Programs are registered, developed, operated, and owned by third parties unrelated to WeChat or Weixin (unless otherwise stated in the relevant Official Account or Mini Program). When you interact with such Official Accounts, Service Accounts and Mini Programs, your use of the relevant Official Accounts, Service Accounts and Mini Programs will be subject to those third-party developer's own terms for the relevant Official Account, Service Account or Mini Program and not these Terms.

_Weixin Pay_

If you are a Weixin Pay user, you may be able to access Weixin Pay via the WeChat platform. Weixin Pay is operated by a China Mainland licensed entity and the use of Weixin Pay service is subject to the [_Weixin Pay User Service Agreement_](https://weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/readtemplate?uin=&stype=&promote=&fr=&lang=en_US&ADTAG=&check=false&nav=faq&t=weixin_agreement&s=pay).

9\. ADVERTISING CONTENT ON WECHAT
---------------------------------

WeChat may include advertising or commercial content. You agree that:

*   we may integrate, display and otherwise communicate advertising or commercial content in WeChat and that (where reasonably practicable) we will identify such advertising or commercial content; and
*   as explained in more detail in our [WeChat Privacy Policy](https://www.wechat.com/en/privacy_policy.html), we may use targeted advertising to try to make advertising more relevant and valuable to you.

10\. OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

We grant you a limited, personal, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferrable, royalty-free and revocable right to use WeChat and any software from us as part of or in relation to your use of WeChat (any such software being the "**WeChat Software**"), solely in accordance with these Terms and subject to any other instructions as provided by us to you in relation to your use of WeChat and/or the WeChat Software from time to time. Please note that these terms may be supplemented by terms and conditions applicable to WeChat Software (or specific features within WeChat Software).

You may not copy, modify, create derivative works, reverse compile, reverse engineer or extract source codes from WeChat Software, and you may not sell, distribute, redistribute or sublicense WeChat or the WeChat Software, except in each case to the extent that we may not prohibit you from doing so under applicable laws or regulations or you have our prior written consent to do so. Where applicable laws or regulations entitle you to reverse compile or extract source codes from WeChat Software, you will first contact us to request the information you need.

We may from time to time provide updates to WeChat Software. Such updates may occur automatically or manually. Please note that WeChat Software may not operate properly or at all if upgrades or new versions are not installed by you. We do not guarantee that we will provide any updates for any WeChat Software, or that such updates will continue to support your device or system. All updates to the WeChat Software are part of the WeChat Software and subject to these Terms, except as otherwise specified by us.

For the purposes of these Terms, “WeChat Software” includes any items, content or features (the "**Items**") within the WeChat Software – for example, Stickers, games or other downloadable items within WeChat, and any content accessed or used by you within WeChat. You must comply with any Additional Terms applicable to any such Items. We will notify you of any such additional terms and conditions within WeChat, within an Appendix to these Terms and/or in another manner. We may grant you a limited right to use these Items upon payment by you of "real world money" as applicable from time to time. You acknowledge that you do not own these Items and the amounts associated with such Items do not refer to any credit balance of real currency or the equivalent. We may eliminate these Items from WeChat at any time, and we have no liability to you in the event that we exercise these rights.

For the purpose of these Terms, "WeChat Software" also includes any APIs we make available to you for use in connection with WeChat or the WeChat Software. You must comply with any Additional Terms applicable to such APIs.

We may in our discretion provide technical support for WeChat (whether for free or for a fee). We provide technical support without any guarantee or warranty of any kind, and subject always to these Terms.

11\. OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE
-------------------------

Certain WeChat Software may contain software that are subject to “open source” licences (the “**Open Source Software**”). Where we use such Open Source Software, please note that:

*   there may be provisions in the Open Source Software's licence that expressly override these Terms, in which case such provisions shall prevail to the extent of any conflict with these Terms; and
*   we will credit the relevant Open Source Software used in WeChat Software within an Appendix to these terms and/or within the relevant WeChat Software.

17\. TERMINATION
----------------

These Terms will apply to your use of WeChat until your access to WeChat is terminated by either you or us.

You may terminate your use of WeChat, or any of the services accessible therein, at any time (including if we have told you about an upcoming change to all or part of WeChat or these Terms which you do not agree to). If the terminated service is a paid service, we may deduct from any refund a reasonable proportion of such fee as compensation for the costs incurred by us in ending the relevant service.

We may suspend or terminate your access to your account or any or all of WeChat:

*   if we undertake maintenance or support of WeChat;
*   to make changes to WeChat as notified by us to you;
*   if we reasonably believe that you have breached these Terms;

*   if you fail to use WeChat for a prolonged period;
*   if such suspension or termination is required due to applicable laws; or
*   to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations, for any other reason in our sole and absolute discretion, and where reasonably practicable, we will give you advance notice of any suspension or termination.

If we suspend your access to any or all of WeChat then, to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction:

*   you remain responsible for all fees accrued through the date of suspension (including where the fees were incurred before suspension date but performance of the relevant obligations were after the suspension date); and
*   you remain responsible for any applicable fees for any part of WeChat to which you continue to have access.

If your access to WeChat is terminated (in whole or in part) by you or us, you agree that:

*   all of your rights under these Terms will terminate;
*   you remain responsible for all fees accrued through the date of termination (including where the fees were incurred before termination date but performance of the relevant obligations were after the termination date); and

Please ensure that you regularly back up Your Content.

18\. GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION
-----------------------------------------

_Governing Law_

These Terms and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with these Terms will be governed by the laws of Singapore without regard to its conflict of law principles and not including the provisions of the 1980 U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.

_Mandatory Arbitration_

Any dispute, controversy or claim (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) arising out of, relating to, or in connection with these Terms, including their existence, validity, interpretation, performance, breach, or termination, will be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre under the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre in force when the Notice of Arbitration is submitted. The seat of the arbitration will be Singapore. There will be one arbitrator only. The arbitration proceedings will be conducted in English.

_Mandatory Informal Resolution_

You and we agree that, before either party initiates any legal proceedings, the parties will first attempt to informally resolve their dispute. You shall notify WeChat of your intent to initiate the informal dispute resolution process by emailing [noticeofdispute@wechat.com](mailto:noticeofdispute@wechat.com). The notice must contain the WeChat ID, name, telephone number, mailing address, and e-mail address of the initiating party, a factual description of the nature and basis of the dispute, the amount that the party is seeking for resolution of the dispute, and the personal signature of the party (a copy of which may be submitted via e-mail). An informal dispute resolution conference is to be held within sixty (60) days of such notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. Any statute of limitations will be tolled while the parties try to resolve issues through this informal process. The informal dispute resolution conferences shall be individualized; multiple individuals initiating claims cannot participate in the same informal dispute resolution conference, unless mutually agreed to in writing by the parties. If a party is represented by counsel, the party’s counsel may participate in the conference, but both parties shall also fully participate in the conference. If the parties cannot resolve the issue within 60 days of the notice, either party can initiate the arbitration process.

Participating in this informal dispute resolution process is a requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration or any other legal proceeding. An arbitration or any other legal proceeding shall be dismissed if it was filed without fully and completely complying with these informal dispute resolution procedures.

_Exceptions_

Notwithstanding the above terms of this “Governing Law and Dispute Resolution” section:

*   To the extent any applicable laws and regulations of your place of residence render the foregoing governing law and dispute resolution process unenforceable (for example, you may have statutory rights in your jurisdiction in relation to bringing or defending claims in a local court (including small claims court)), such laws and regulations will govern;
*   To the extent there is any inconsistency between any applicable Additional Terms and the terms in this section, the Additional Terms will prevail; and
*   To the extent any applicable Additional Terms expressly and entirely replace this section, those Additional Terms apply and supersede this section.

19\. GENERAL
------------

_Entire Agreement_

Subject to the applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction, these Terms (including the incorporated Additional Terms) set out the entire agreement between you and us in relation to WeChat – you agree that you will have no claim against us for any statement which is not explicitly set out in these Terms. The words "include" and "including" are to be construed without limitation.

_Severability; Waiver_

The invalidity of any provision of these Terms (or parts of any provision) will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision (or the remaining parts of that provision). If it is held that we cannot enforce any part of these Terms as drafted, we may replace those terms with similar terms to the extent enforceable under applicable laws and regulations, without changing the remaining terms of these Terms. No delay in enforcing any provision of these Terms will be construed to be a waiver of any rights under that provision.

_Survival_

Any rights and obligations under these Terms which by their nature should survive, including any obligations in relation to the liability of, or indemnities (if any) given by, the respective parties, and any dispute resolution clause, will remain in effect after termination or expiration of these Terms.

_Transfer and Assignment_

No person other than you and us will have any right to enforce these Terms, whether pursuant to the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 2001 (Chapter 53B) of Singapore or otherwise, and you may not delegate, assign or transfer these Terms or any rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior consent. We may freely assign or transfer these Terms or our rights and obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, without your prior consent or prior notice to you.

_Sub-contracting_

We may freely sub-contract any part of our performance of these Terms at any time, without your prior consent or prior notice to you.

  

ADDENDUM: ADDITIONAL COUNTRY-SPECIFIC TERMS
===========================================

> SCHEDULE 1: UNITED STATES-SPECIFIC TERMS
> ----------------------------------------
> 
> If you are a user of WeChat residing in the United States, the terms contained in this Schedule 1 (this “**Arbitration Agreement**”) are incorporated into these Terms and expressly and entirely replace the above “Governing Law and Dispute Resolution” section of these Terms.
> 
> _Scope of Arbitration Agreement_
> 
> You and we agree that all disputes, controversies, or claims (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) arising out of, relating to, or in connection with these Terms or your use of WeChat, or any aspect of your relationship with us (“**Disputes**”), shall be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement, except (1) you may assert individual claims in small claims court in the county in which you reside if the small claims court has jurisdiction (which issue should be decided by that court); (2) any request for public injunctive relief will be litigated in court after finishing arbitration of the remaining claims, as discussed below in the paragraph entitled “Waiver of Class, Consolidated, and Representative Actions; Severance of Public Injunctive Relief”; (3) a court may enter injunctive relief to enforce the pre-filing mandatory informal resolution requirements as provided below in the paragraphs entitled “Mandatory Informal Resolution”; and (4) a court may enjoin the filing of an arbitration seeking to apply a prior arbitration agreement as provided below in the paragraph entitled “Opt-Out of Modifications.” This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all Disputes that arose, accrued, or were asserted before, on, or after the effective date of these Terms or this Arbitration Agreement, whether based on past, present, or future events.
> 
> _Governing Law_
> 
> These Terms and any Dispute will be governed by Delaware law, without regard to conflict of law principles, except the Federal Arbitration Act (“**FAA**”) governs all issues related to arbitration, including the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. You and we agree that the activities in these Terms relate to foreign and interstate commerce.
> 
> _Mandatory Informal Resolution_
> 
> You and we agree that, before either party initiates a legal proceeding, the parties will first attempt to informally resolve their Dispute. Either party shall notify the other party of its intent to initiate the informal resolution process for a Dispute by sending a written notice of the Dispute (“**Notice of Dispute**”). You shall send your Notice of Dispute to [noticeofdispute@wechat.com](mailto:noticeofdispute@wechat.com). If we have a Dispute with you, we will send a Notice of Dispute to the contact information we have in our files for you. The Notice of Dispute must contain the name, telephone number, mailing address, and e-mail address of the initiating party, the WeChat ID at issue, a factual description of the nature and basis of the Dispute, the amount and any other remedy that the party is seeking for resolution of the Dispute, and the personal signature of the party. The parties will negotiate in good faith for sixty (60) days after either you or we receive a Notice of Dispute that complies with all of these requirements. A non-compliant Notice of Dispute does not start the 60-day informal resolution period. The parties shall hold an informal dispute resolution conference (telephonic or video) within the 60-day informal resolution period, if either party requests one. Any statute of limitations will be tolled while the parties try to resolve issues through this informal process. The informal dispute resolution conferences shall be individualized; multiple individuals initiating claims cannot participate in the same informal dispute resolution conference, unless mutually agreed to in writing by the parties. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference. If you choose to have your counsel attend the conference, our counsel may attend the conference, but we will also have a company representative fully participate in the conference.
> 
> Participating in this informal dispute resolution process is a requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing any legal proceeding. A legal proceeding shall be dismissed if it was filed without fully and completely complying with these informal dispute resolution procedures. In particular, if either of us commence an arbitration without first having sent a compliant Notice of Dispute and complying with other informal dispute resolution procedures described above (including participating in an informal dispute resolution conference if either party requests one), the arbitration provider has no jurisdiction over the Dispute and shall administratively close the Dispute. If the arbitration provider fails to close such Dispute, a court may enter injunctive relief to enforce the informal dispute resolution requirements, including an injunction to stay any arbitration that has been commenced in violation of these requirements.
> 
> _Arbitration Forum and Rules_
> 
> If you and we are unable to come to informal resolution, you and we agree to binding individual arbitration before Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“**JAMS**”) under its Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures, available at [https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/](https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/), or, if applicable, its Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines, available at [https://www.jamsadr.com/mass-arbitration-procedures](https://www.jamsadr.com/mass-arbitration-procedures), and pursuant to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. The fees and costs of the arbitration will be borne by the parties according to the then-applicable JAMS Schedule of Fees and Costs. JAMS may also be reached at 800.352.5267 for further information. The terms in this Arbitration Agreement govern to the extent they conflict with JAMS rules.
> 
> Any arbitration hearing will take place virtually or in the county where you live, unless we both agree to a different location. The arbitrator shall be a retired federal judge. The arbitrator shall have the authority to consider and grant dispositive motions and will apply the standards of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governing such motions. Except as expressly provided in the paragraphs entitled “Mandatory Informal Resolution” and the paragraph entitled “Opt-Out of Modifications,” the arbitrator, and not any federal or state court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the validity, interpretation, applicability, scope, or enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate, including, but not limited to, the arbitrability of any Dispute and any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable, to the extent permitted by applicable law. The arbitrator shall make a decision in writing, which will include the findings and conclusions on which the decision is based. The arbitrator has the authority to issue any relief allowed by applicable law, but the arbitrator shall have no authority to issue any relief on any basis other than an individual basis. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.
> 
> _Demand for Arbitration_
> 
> A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written demand for arbitration to JAMS and give notice to the other party as specified in JAMS rules. The demand for arbitration submitted by either you or us must identify the WeChat ID at issue, the claim(s) asserted, factual basis for the claim(s), and relief and/or remedy sought. The demand for arbitration must be personally signed by the party seeking arbitration. A failure to follow these filing requirements shall be a basis for dismissal of the demand for arbitration, including by a Process Administrator, as defined in JAMS Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines. By signing any demand for arbitration, the signing party certifies to the best of its knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that (i) the demand for arbitration is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (ii) the claims and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (iii) the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery. The arbitrator shall be authorized to afford any relief or impose any sanctions available under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 or any analogous state law for either party’s violation of this requirement.
> 
> _Offer of Judgment_
> 
> In the arbitration proceedings, a party may serve a written offer of judgment on the other party to allow judgment on specific terms at least ten (10) days before the date set for the arbitration hearing. If the offer is accepted, the offer with proof of acceptance shall be submitted to JAMS, which shall issue an award accordingly. If the offer is not accepted prior to the arbitration hearing or within thirty (30) days after it is made, whichever occurs first, it shall be deemed withdrawn and cannot be given as evidence in the arbitration, other than with respect to costs. If the judgment that the other party finally obtains is not more favorable than the unaccepted offer, then the other party shall pay the costs incurred after the offer was made, to the extent such cost-shifting is not prohibited by applicable law or JAMS rules, provided that the arbitrator shall have discretion to release you from the obligation to cover our costs in circumstances of financial hardship.
> 
> _Grouped Arbitrations_
> 
> To the extent permitted by applicable law and notwithstanding any other provision of this Arbitration Agreement, if fifty (50) or more claimants represented by the same or coordinated counsel file demands for arbitration raising substantially similar Disputes, those coordinated filings are considered “Mass Arbitrations” under JAMS Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines, and you and we agree that the following additional procedures shall apply: (1) once counsel representing you in the Mass Arbitrations has submitted at least 50 compliant demands for arbitration to JAMS and the Process Administrator has heard and determined preliminary and administrative matters in accordance with JAMS Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines and this Arbitration Agreement, the parties shall cooperate to organize the demands for arbitration into randomized groups of 50 claimants each (plus, to the extent there are fewer than 50 claimants remaining, a final group consisting of the remaining claimants), with each group proceeding as a single consolidated arbitration (a “**Grouped Arbitration**”) and with a single arbitrator presiding over each group; (2) for each Grouped Arbitration, the arbitrator presiding over that group shall decide all common issues of fact and law first—including considering and granting dispositive motions under the standards of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governing such motions—before proceeding to deciding individual factual and legal issues and issuing individualized final awards; (3) within each Grouped Arbitration, discovery shall be consolidated and coordinated; and (4) no final award from an arbitrator shall have preclusive effect in another arbitration; an order in a Grouped Arbitration, however, may be shared for its persuasive value in related Grouped Arbitration proceedings.
> 
> _Appeals_
> 
> If the arbitration involves a request for an injunction or monetary relief that exceeds one million U.S. dollars (USD 1,000,000)—or in the case of a Grouped Arbitration, individual monetary relief that exceeds thirty thousand U.S. dollars (USD 30,000)—then either party shall have the right to appeal any award on such request for relief to an arbitration appellate panel. Appeals of individual awards within a Grouped Arbitration shall proceed as a single consolidated appeal before one arbitration appellate panel. The notice of appeal must be served, in writing, on the opposing party within fourteen (14) days after the award has become final. Notice of appeal in a Grouped Arbitration may be served on the parties’ respective arbitration counsel. JAMS shall administer the appeal consistent with JAMS Optional Appeal Procedures, available at [https://www.jamsadr.com/appeal/](https://www.jamsadr.com/appeal/).
> 
> _Waiver of Class, Consolidated, and Representative Actions; Severance of Public Injunctive Relief_
> 
> EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED ABOVE IN THE PARAGRAPH ENTITLED “GROUPED ARBITRATIONS,” CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS, CLASS ARBITRATIONS, COLLECTIVE ACTIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY-GENERAL ACTIONS, AND ANY OTHER PROCEEDING WHERE SOMEONE ACTS IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ARE NOT ALLOWED, NOR IS COMBINING INDIVIDUAL PROCEEDINGS WITHOUT THE WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES. YOU AND WE AGREE NOT TO ACT IN THE CAPACITY OF A NAMED PLAINTIFF, CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, OPT-IN PLAINTIFF, CLASS MEMBER, OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN ANY CAPACITY IN A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY. THIS PROVISION DOES NOT PREVENT YOU OR US FROM SETTLING CLAIMS ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. AS STATED IN THE PARAGRAPH ENTITLED “SCOPE OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT” ABOVE, YOU AND WE BOTH AGREE TO SEVER ANY REQUEST FOR PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND LITIGATE THAT ISSUE IN COURT AFTER FINISHING ARBITRATION FOR THE REMAINING CLAIMS (INCLUDING ALL ISSUES OF LIABILITY).
> 
> _Waiver of Jury Trial_
> 
> EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR YOUR USE OF WECHAT.
> 
> _Venue_
> 
> For Disputes that are not subject to arbitration as expressly set forth in this Arbitration Agreement or as required by applicable law (other than small claims actions), the exclusive venue shall be the federal courts located in the State of California. If those courts do not have subject matter jurisdiction, then the exclusive venue shall be the state courts in the State of California. You and we consent to the jurisdiction of such California courts for purposes of such proceedings.
> 
> _Opt-Out of Modifications_
> 
> If you have previously agreed to arbitrate with us, you may opt out of the modifications to your prior arbitration agreement made by this Arbitration Agreement by sending us written notice no later than thirty (30) days after the effective date of this Arbitration Agreement. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us, and all other parts of these Terms will continue to apply to you. To be effective, your written notice must be sent to [noticeofdispute@wechat.com](mailto:noticeofdispute@wechat.com) and must include your name, mailing address, WeChat ID, the phone number used to set up your account, and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. This written notice must be dated and personally signed by you, and not any attorney, agent, or other representative of yours. Should you not opt out within the 30-day period in accordance with this procedure, you and we shall be bound by the terms of this Arbitration Agreement in full. You and we agree that if you do not opt out in accordance with this procedure but either you or we commence an arbitration and seek to apply an arbitration agreement between you and us that predates this Arbitration Agreement, either you or we may seek injunctive relief in court, and a court may enter injunctive relief enjoining the filing of arbitration under the prior agreement.
> 
> _Severability_
> 
> If the class action waiver in the paragraph entitled “Waiver of Class, Consolidated, and Representative Actions; Severance of Public Injunctive Relief” is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a Dispute, then those parts will not be arbitrated but will proceed in court, with the rest proceeding in arbitration. If any other provision of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed, but the rest of these provisions regarding arbitration still apply.

SCHEDULE 2: AUSTRALIA-SPECIFIC TERMS
