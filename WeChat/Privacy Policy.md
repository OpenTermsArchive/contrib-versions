**SUMMARY**

Thank you for using WeChat! We respect your concerns about privacy and appreciate your trust and confidence in us.

Here is a summary of the information contained in this privacy policy ("**Privacy Policy**"). This summary is to help you navigate the Privacy Policy and it is not a substitute for reading everything! You can use the hyperlinks below to jump directly to particular sections in the Privacy Policy.

**DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLY TO YOU?**

This Privacy Policy only applies to you if you are a **WeChat user**, meaning that you have registered by linking a mobile number that uses an international dialing code other than +86 ("**non-Chinese Mainland mobile number**").

This Privacy Policy does not apply to you if you are a **Weixin user**. You are a Weixin user if you have either:

*   registered by linking a mobile number that uses international dialing code +86 ("**Chinese Mainland mobile number**"); or
*   contracted with 深圳市腾讯计算机系统有限公司(Shenzhen Tencent Computer Systems Company Limited) for Weixin.

**If you are a Weixin user, you are subject to the [Weixin Agreement on Software License and Service of Tencent Weixin](https://weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/readtemplate?lang=en_US&t=weixin_agreement&s=default&cc=CN) and [Weixin Privacy Protection Guidelines](https://weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/readtemplate?lang=en_US&t=weixin_agreement&s=privacy&cc=CN) and not this Privacy Policy.**

You can also check whether you are a WeChat or Weixin user by clicking "Me" > "Settings" > "About" and then clicking the link to the "Terms of Service". If you see the WeChat – Terms of Service then you are a WeChat user. If you see the Agreement on Software License and Service of Tencent Weixin then you are a Weixin user.

**_If you subsequently change your phone number (either from a Chinese Mainland mobile number to a non-Chinese Mainland mobile number, or vice versa) you will be required to convert your account (to either a WeChat or Weixin account, depending on your new phone number). If you convert your Weixin account to a WeChat account, this Privacy Policy applies to you from the date our system records such conversion. If you convert your WeChat account to a Weixin account, this Privacy Policy ceases to apply to you from the date our system records such conversion._**

**WHAT INFORMATION DO YOU NEED TO PROVIDE WECHAT?**

When you register for a WeChat account, we will need your mobile number and an alias. You can further refine and populate your profile with additional information. If you use certain functions available within WeChat (such as posting photos to your Moments), we will process your information to provide these functions. [**More Information**](#pp_how)

7\. SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------

We are committed to maintaining the privacy and integrity of your Personal Information no matter where it is stored or accessed. We protect your Personal Information through the use of information security and access policies that limit unauthorised access to our systems, and technological protection measures such as encryption that ensure confidentiality of your Personal Information during transmission and in storage.

**We do not permanently retain chat data between you and other users on our servers.** Chat data only passes through our servers so that it can be securely distributed to your intended recipients. Chat data is only stored on your device and the devices of the users that you have sent communications to, **unless your recipient adds any of your communications to their Favorites or it is a message that the owner or administrator of your group chat added as a Group Notice**.

You may choose to stop receiving personalised advertising from us by following the opt out instructions included in the Settings section of WeChat or by contacting us at [dataprotection@wechat.com](mailto:dataprotection@wechat.com).

9\. COMMUNICATIONS FROM US

We may send you service-related announcements via WeChat, email, or SMS when necessary, such as when we temporarily suspend WeChat for maintenance, or security, or privacy reasons. You may not opt-out from these service-related announcements which are not promotional in nature.

10\. AGE RESTRICTIONS AND PARENTAL/GUARDIAN CONTROLS
----------------------------------------------------

Children under the age of 16 (or such applicable age of majority under relevant local laws of the user) ("**Child**") must not use WeChat for any purpose without first obtaining parental/guardian consent to and acknowledgment of this Privacy Policy (both for themselves and on their Child's behalf). In certain jurisdictions, you may be required to provide your date of birth; this is only processed on your device and not sent to our servers. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from any Child without such consent and acknowledgment. Please contact our Data Protection Officer if you believe we have any Personal Information from any Child without such parental/guardian consent and acknowledgment so that we can promptly investigate and remove such Personal Information.

11\. YOUR RIGHTS
----------------

**This Section 10 (Your Rights) only applies to users located in a Relevant Jurisdiction, unless otherwise specified.**

**If you are a user located in Australia, Brazil, California, Canada, Hong Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Japan, Macau SAR, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, Russia, Serbia, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan (China), Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom and Vietnam, the terms set out under the name of your jurisdiction in this [page](https://www.wechat.com/en/jurisdictions.html) apply to you in addition to the terms set out in our Privacy Policy.**

Please note that in order to protect your information, we will need to verify your identity before responding to any request to exercise your rights ("**DSR Request**").

For users in a Relevant Jurisdiction, we will respond to your DSR Request without undue delay and in any event within one month (although this may be extended by a further two months in certain circumstances, such as where the request involves substantial volumes of information or is otherwise complex). To exercise any of your rights, please complete the request form [here](https://help.wechat.com/cgi-bin/newreadtemplate?t=help_center/index_vue#/rights-request).

**Access & Correction**

**This section also applies to users resident in Argentina, Canada, India and Russia.**

You have the right to request access to your Personal Information we hold about you, how we use it, and who we share it with. We may not be able to provide you with certain Personal Information if providing it to you would interfere with another person's rights (e.g. where providing the Personal Information we hold about you would reveal information about another person).

You also have the right to correct that information if it is inaccurate or incomplete.

You can access and correct your Personal Information by logging into your WeChat account at any time. For example, you can delete certain Location Data via your device settings or the "Clear Location" option within WeChat.

If you want us to correct your Personal Information that you are unable to correct using your account, please complete the request form [here](https://help.wechat.com/cgi-bin/newreadtemplate?t=help_center/index_vue#/rights-request).

Where we agree to correct your Personal Information, we will use reasonable steps to inform any third party to whom we have disclosed the relevant Personal Information so that they can rectify the Personal Information too.

**Erasure**

**This section also applies to users resident in Argentina, Canada, India and Russia.**

You can delete your account, or remove certain Personal Information, by logging into your WeChat account and following the account deletion instructions [here](https://help.wechat.com/cgi-bin/micromsg-bin/oshelpcenter?opcode=2&lang=en&plat=ios&id=180323e2Ermm180323yqauAZ&Channel=helpcenter). Subsequent to account deletion, aggregated registration data is retained for spam prevention and systems security purposes.

Note that we will not be able to delete your account if you have a positive balance in your Weixin Pay or WeChat Pay account or are the administrator of an Official Account or Mini Program.

If there is any other Personal Information you believe we process that you would like us to erase, please complete the request form [here](https://help.wechat.com/cgi-bin/newreadtemplate?t=help_center/index_vue#/rights-request).

You may request that we erase the Personal Information we hold about you where:

*   you believe that it is no longer necessary for us to hold your Personal Information;
*   we obtained your consent to process the Personal Information and you withdraw that consent (and we have no other valid legal grounds for processing the Personal Information);
*   you believe we are unlawfully processing your Personal Information; or
*   you are or were under the age of 16 (or such applicable age of majority under relevant local laws) when we collected the Personal Information and we can verify this.

You may exercise your right to restrict our processing your Personal Information (as described below) whilst we consider a request to erase your data.

We may retain the Personal Information if there are valid legal grounds for us to do so (e.g., for the defence of legal claims, freedom of expression or some other legal obligation) but we will let you know if that is the case.

Where you have requested that we erase your Personal Information that we have made public and there are valid legal grounds for erasure, we will use reasonable steps to inform any third party to whom we have disclosed the relevant Personal Information so that they can erase it too.

**Restriction of Processing to Storage Only**

**This section also applies to users resident in Russia.**

You have a right to require us to stop processing your Personal Information other than for storage purposes in certain circumstances. However, we may process it if there are other valid legal grounds for us to do so (e.g., for the defence of legal claims or for another's protection).

Where we agree to stop processing the Personal Information, we will use reasonable steps to inform any third party to whom we have disclosed the relevant Personal Information so that they can stop processing it too.

You may request we stop processing and just store the Personal Information we hold about you where:

*   you believe the Personal Information is not accurate (for the period it takes for us to verify whether it is accurate);
*   we wish to erase the Personal Information as the processing is now unlawful (but you want us to retain the Personal Information and just store it instead); or
*   we wish to erase the Personal Information as it is no longer necessary for our purposes (but you require it to be stored for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims).

**Portability**

You have the right to receive a copy of certain of your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. This comprises any Personal Information we process on the basis of your consent (e.g., Shared Information and content saved to Favorites) or pursuant to our contract with you (e.g., profile data), as described in the section [**"How do we use your information?"**](#pp_how). You can exercise your right to export your data by following the instructions [here](https://help.wechat.com/cgi-bin/micromsg-bin/oshelpcenter?opcode=2&lang=en&plat=ios&id=180323e2Ermm180323yqauAZ&Channel=helpcenter).

You also have the right to request that we transfer that Personal Information to another party. If you wish for us to transfer the Personal Information to a third party, please ensure you detail that party. Note that we can only make such transfers where it is technically feasible. We are not responsible for the security of the Personal Information or its processing once received by the third party.

**Objection**

**This section also applies to users resident in Russia.**

You may object to our use of your Personal Information that we use on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g., when we use your Personal Information to ensure account security). If you object to such processing, please complete this [request form](https://help.wechat.com/cgi-bin/newreadtemplate?t=help_center/index_vue#/rights-request).

To the extent provided by applicable laws and regulations, you may withdraw any consent you previously provided to us by following the instructions set out [here](https://help.wechat.com/cgi-bin/micromsg-bin/oshelpcenter?opcode=2&lang=en&plat=ios&id=180323e2Ermm180323yqauAZ&Channel=helpcenter).
