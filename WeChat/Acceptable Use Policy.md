If you have any questions about this Policy, please contact us using the details at the end of this Policy.

1\. GENERAL
-----------

1.1. **Introduction**

Our aim for WeChat is that it will always make a positive impact on our users' lives, and that it will be a platform that benefits its users.

We are constantly looking to improve and innovate WeChat. Part of achieving this goal is ensuring that users can continue to use WeChat safely and that WeChat is used in an acceptable manner by all users. This Policy sets out rules to ensure good behaviour in the use of WeChat by users.

We are guided by continuous feedback from users and industry experts in developing this Policy, and we strive to ensure that this Policy is inclusive of diverse ideas, views and information. We are always open to receiving feedback from our users – if you wish to do so, please contact us using the details at the end of this Policy.

1.2. **Enforcement and breach (or potential breach) of this Policy**

Where you have (or we reasonably believe you have) breached this Policy, we may, at our discretion, do any or all of the following:

*   a. Issue a warning regarding your behaviour.
*   b. Refrain from displaying or remove the relevant content relating to such breach (or reasonably suspected breach).
*   c. Display a notice to recipients of the relevant content to take precaution due to a suspected or confirmed breach of this Policy.
*   d. Restrict you from using certain account functions or suspend or terminate your account.
*   e. Where we reasonably believe that you have committed a crime or are otherwise required to do so under applicable laws, notify and cooperate with appropriate governmental and/or law enforcement authorities in the relevant jurisdiction.

While we will aim to apply this Policy consistently across all jurisdictions, in some jurisdictions there may be specific requirements under applicable laws which necessitate differing applications of parts of this Policy.

If you wish to report another user who may have potentially breached this policy, please refer to Section 12 of this Policy for our contact details.

*   c. Attempting to distinguish legitimate newsworthy content from other content.
*   d. Permitting humour and social commentary on various topics, subject to a reasonable standard.
*   e. Additional information that is available to us, whether via WeChat or third parties.

We will continue to engage with our users and third-party experts from time to time, to ensure that this Policy continues to reflect our values and applicable laws and regulations, while ensuring that using WeChat remains a safe and fun experience for our users.
