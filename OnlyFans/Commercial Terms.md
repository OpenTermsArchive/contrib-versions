You also agree to ensure that you log out of your account at the end of each session, and to be particularly careful when accessing your account from a public or shared computer so that others are not able to access, view or record your password or other personal information.

    2.  It is our policy to suspend access to any Content you post on OnlyFans which we become aware may not comply with the Terms of Service (including, in particular, our [Acceptable Use Policy](#acceptable-use-policy)) and/or any applicable law whilst we investigate the suspected non-compliance or unlawfulness of such Content. If we suspend access to any of your Content, you may request a review of our decision to suspend access to the relevant Content by contacting us at [support@onlyfans.com](mailto:support@onlyfans.com). Following our investigation of the suspected non-compliance or unlawfulness of the relevant Content, we may take any action we consider appropriate, including to reinstate access to the Content or to permanently remove or disable access to the relevant Content without needing to obtain any consent from you and without giving you prior notice. You agree that you will at your own cost promptly provide to us all reasonable assistance (including by providing us with copies of any information which we request) in our investigation. We will not be responsible for any loss suffered by you arising from the suspension of access to your Content or any other steps which we take in good faith to investigate any suspected non-compliance or unlawfulness of your Content under this section.
    3.  If we suspend access to or delete any of your Content, we will notify you via email or electronic message to your OnlyFans account, but we are not obligated to give you prior notice of such removal or suspension.
    4.  We reserve the right in our sole discretion to terminate your agreement with us and your access to OnlyFans for any reason by giving you 30 daysâ€™ notice by email or electronic message to your OnlyFans account. We can also suspend access to your User account or terminate your agreement with us and your access to OnlyFans immediately and without prior notice:
        
        *   if we think that you have or may have seriously or repeatedly breached any part of the Terms of Service (including in particular our Acceptable Use Policy), or if you attempt or threaten to breach any part of the Terms of Service in a way which has or could have serious consequences for us or another User; or
        *   if you take any action that in our opinion has caused or is reasonably likely to cause us to suffer a loss or that otherwise harms the reputation of OnlyFans.
        
        If we suspend access to your User account or terminate your agreement with us and your access to OnlyFans we will let you know. During any period when access to your User account is suspended, any Fan Payments which would otherwise have fallen due during the period of suspension will be suspended, and we may withhold all or any part of the Creator Earnings due to you but not yet paid out in accordance with section 13 of the Terms of Use for Creators.
        
    5.  Upon termination of your account, we may deal with your Content in any appropriate manner in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://onlyfans.com/privacy) (including by deleting it) and you will no longer be entitled to access your Content.

    9.  Other than Content (which is owned by or licensed to Creators), all rights in and to OnlyFans and its entire contents, features, databases, source code and functionality, are owned by us and/or our licensors. Such material is protected by copyright, and may be protected by trademark, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws.

    1.  We do not authorize or approve Content on OnlyFans, and views expressed by Creators or Fans on OnlyFans do not necessarily represent our views.
    2.  We do not grant you any rights in relation to Content. Any such rights may only be granted to you by Creators.
    3.  Your Content may be viewed by individuals that recognise your identity. We will not in any way be responsible to you if you are identified from your Content. While we may, from time to time and in our sole discretion, offer certain geofencing or geolocation technology on OnlyFans, you understand and agree that we do not guarantee the accuracy or effectiveness of such technology, and you will have no claim against us arising from your use of or reliance upon any geofencing or geolocation technology on OnlyFans.
    4.  All Content is created, selected, and provided by Users and not by us. We are not responsible for reviewing or moderating Content, and we do not select or modify the Content that is stored or transmitted via OnlyFans. We are under no obligation to monitor Content or to detect breaches of the Terms of Service (including the [Acceptable Use Policy](#acceptable-use-policy)).
    5.  You agree that you have no obligation to follow any suggestions, comments, reviews, or instructions received from another User of OnlyFans and that if you choose to do so, you do so entirely at your own risk.
    6.  We make no promises or guarantees of any kind that Creators or Referring Users will make a particular sum of money (or any money) from their use of OnlyFans (including the OnlyFans Referral Program).
    7.  The materials which we make accessible on OnlyFans for Users are for general information only. We make no promises or guarantees about the accuracy or otherwise of such materials, or that Users will achieve any particular result or outcome from using such materials.
    8.  We do not promise that OnlyFans is compatible with all devices and operating systems. You are responsible for configuring your information technology, device, and computer programs to access OnlyFans. You should use your own virus protection software.
    9.  We are not responsible for the availability of the internet, or any errors in your connections, device or other equipment, or software that may occur in relation to your use of OnlyFans.
    10.  While we try to make sure that OnlyFans is secure and free from bugs and viruses, we cannot promise that it will be and have no control over the Content that is supplied by Creators.
    11.  We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised User accounts, passwords, email accounts, or any resulting unauthorized activities or resulting unauthorized payments or withdrawals of funds.
    12.  You acknowledge that once your Content is posted on OnlyFans, we cannot control and will not be responsible to you for the use which other Users or third parties make of such Content. You can delete your account at any time, but you acknowledge that deleting your account will not of itself prevent the circulation of any of your Content which may have been recorded by other Users in breach of the Terms of Service or by third parties prior to the deletion of your account.
10.  **Intellectual property rights â€“ ownership and licenses:**
    
    1.  You confirm that you own all intellectual property rights (examples of which are copyright and trademarks) in your Content or that you have obtained all necessary rights to your Content which are required to grant licenses in respect of your Content to us and to other Users. This includes any rights required to engage in the acts covered by sub-section **10(b)** below in any territory in which OnlyFans is accessible and, in particular, in the United States of America, the United Kingdom and the European Union.
    2.  You agree to grant us a license under all your Content to perform any act restricted by any intellectual property right (including copyright) in such Content, for any purpose reasonably related to the provision and operation of OnlyFans. Such acts include to reproduce, make available and communicate to the public, display, perform, distribute, translate, and create adaptations or derivative works of your Content, and otherwise deal in your Content.
    3.  The license which you grant to us under sub-section **10(b)** above is perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, assignable and transferable by us. This means that the license will continue even after your agreement with us ends and you stop using OnlyFans, that we do not have to pay you for the license, and that we can grant a sub-license of your Content to someone else or assign or transfer the license to someone else. This license will allow us, for example, to add stickers, text, and watermarks to your Content, to make your Content available to other Users of OnlyFans, as well as to use your Content for other normal operations of OnlyFans. We will never sell your Content to other platforms, though we may sell or transfer any license you grant to us in the Terms of Service in the event of a sale of our company or its assets to a third party.
    4.  Whilst we do not own your Content, you grant us the limited right to submit notifications of infringement (including of copyright or trademark) on your behalf to any third-party website or service that hosts or is otherwise dealing in infringing copies of your Content without your permission. Although we are not under any obligation to do so, we may at any time submit or withdraw any such notification to any third-party website or service where we consider it appropriate to do so. However, we do not and are under no obligation to police infringements of your Content. You agree that if we request, you will provide us with all consents and other information which we reasonably need to submit notifications of infringement on your behalf. Please see our [Complaints Policy](#complaints-policy) for how to make a complaint about infringement of intellectual property rights.
    5.  You waive any moral rights which you may have under any applicable law to object to derogatory treatment of any Content posted by you on OnlyFans. This waiver does not affect in any way your ownership of any intellectual property rights in your Content or the rights which you have to prevent your Content from being copied without your permission. The waiver is intended to allow us when dealing with your Content (as permitted by the license which you give us in section **10(b)** above) to add watermarks, stickers or text to your Content.
11.  **Twitter:** Users have the facility to connect an active Twitter account to their OnlyFans account and to share certain Content in the form of OnlyFans posts to Twitter using the share feature. If you use this feature, you must fully comply with Twitter's terms of service from time to time in respect of any Content shared in this way.
12.  **Linking to and from OnlyFans:**
    
    1.  Links to OnlyFans:
        
        *   You may link to the OnlyFans homepage, provided you do so in a way that is fair and legal and does not damage our reputation or take advantage of it, but you must not establish a link in such a way as to suggest any form of association, approval, or endorsement on our part.
        *   If you are a Creator, when promoting your Creator account you must comply with our Terms of Service and the terms of service of any other website where you place a link to or otherwise promote your Creator account. When promoting your Creator account, you must not impersonate OnlyFans or give the impression that your Creator account is being promoted by us if this is not the case. You must not promote your OnlyFans account by using Google Ads or any similar advertising platform or search engine advertising service.
    2.  Links from OnlyFans: If OnlyFans contains links to other sites and resources provided by third parties, these links are provided for your convenience only. Such links should not be interpreted as approval by us of those linked websites or information you may obtain from them. We have no control over the contents of those sites or resources and accept no responsibility for them or for any loss or damage that may arise from your use of them. If you decide to access any of the third-party websites linked to OnlyFans, you do so entirely at your own risk and subject to the terms and conditions of use for such websites.
    3.  Domain Names: In some instances, OnlyFans may allow Creators to register or use domain names that contain the OnlyFans trademark or a confusingly similar term. However, you will not register such a domain name, unless:
        
        *   The domain name is registered by the Creator.
        *   The domain name redirects to the Creatorâ€™s OnlyFans profile. Domain names containing the OnlyFans trademark or a confusingly similar term must not direct to any other website, including link aggregators.
        *   The Creator obtains prior written permission from OnlyFans and signs a licensing agreement.
        
        If you would like to register a domain name containing the OnlyFans trademark or a confusingly similar term, please contact [support@onlyfans.com](mailto:support@onlyfans.com). Failing to comply with these provisions or the licensing agreement will be considered a violation of the licensing agreement and may result in OnlyFans filing a domain dispute against the registrant.
        
13.  **How do I delete my account?** If you want to delete your OnlyFans account then you may do so in the 'User Account' section of your OnlyFans account.
    
    1.  If you are a Fan, the deletion of your account will take place within a reasonable time following your request.
    2.  If you are a Creator, then once you initiate the "**delete account**" process your account will remain open until the last day of your Fans' paid Subscription period, following which you will receive your final payment and your account will be deleted.
    3.  If you are both a Fan and a Creator then your account will be deleted in two stages (Fan first and then Creator).
    4.  Once your account has been deleted you won't be charged any further amounts or have access to your former OnlyFans account or its Content, and any subscriptions will be deleted and cannot be subsequently renewed. You will receive an email confirmation upon the successful deletion of your account. Once your account has been deleted, we may deal with your Content in any appropriate manner in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://onlyfans.com/privacy) (including by deleting it) and you will no longer be entitled to access your Content. There is no technical facility on OnlyFans for you to be able to access your Content following termination of your account.

    1.  If any aspect of your agreement with us is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
    2.  If we fail to enforce any aspect of your agreement with us, it will not be a waiver;
