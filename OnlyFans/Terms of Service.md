You will contact [support@onlyfans.com](mailto:support@onlyfans.com) promptly if you believe someone has used or is using your account without your permission or if your account has been subject to any other breach of security. You also agree to ensure that you log out of your account at the end of each session, and to be particularly careful when accessing your account from a public or shared computer so that others are not able to access, view or record your password or other personal information.

    7. You will comply in full with these Terms of Use for all Users, our [Acceptable Use Policy](#acceptable-use-policy) and all other parts of the Terms of Service which apply to your use of OnlyFans.
8. **Rights we have, including to suspend or terminate your account:**
    
    1. We can but we are not obligated to moderate or review any of your Content to verify compliance with the Terms of Service (including, in particular, our [Acceptable Use Policy](#acceptable-use-policy)) and/or any applicable law.
    2. It is our policy to suspend access to any Content you post on OnlyFans which we become aware may not comply with the Terms of Service (including, in particular, our [Acceptable Use Policy](#acceptable-use-policy)) and/or any applicable law whilst we investigate the suspected non-compliance or unlawfulness of such Content. If we suspend access to any of your Content, you may request a review of our decision to suspend access to the relevant Content by contacting us at [support@onlyfans.com](mailto:support@onlyfans.com). Following our investigation of the suspected non-compliance or unlawfulness of the relevant Content, we may take any action we consider appropriate, including to reinstate access to the Content or to permanently remove or disable access to the relevant Content without needing to obtain any consent from you and without giving you prior notice. You agree that you will at your own cost promptly provide to us all reasonable assistance (including by providing us with copies of any information which we request) in our investigation. We will not be responsible for any loss suffered by you arising from the suspension of access to your Content or any other steps which we take in good faith to investigate any suspected non-compliance or unlawfulness of your Content under this section.
    3. If we suspend access to or delete any of your Content, we will notify you via email or electronic message to your OnlyFans account, but we are not obligated to give you prior notice of such removal or suspension.
    4. We reserve the right in our sole discretion to terminate your agreement with us and your access to OnlyFans for any reason by giving you 30 days’ notice by email or electronic message to your OnlyFans account. We can also suspend access to your User account or terminate your agreement with us and your access to OnlyFans immediately and without prior notice:
        
        * if we think that you have or may have seriously or repeatedly breached any part of the Terms of Service (including in particular our Acceptable Use Policy), or if you attempt or threaten to breach any part of the Terms of Service in a way which has or could have serious consequences for us or another User; or
        * if you take any action that in our opinion has caused or is reasonably likely to cause us to suffer a loss or that otherwise harms the reputation of OnlyFans.
        
        If we suspend access to your User account or terminate your agreement with us and your access to OnlyFans we will let you know. During any period when access to your User account is suspended, any Fan Payments which would otherwise have fallen due during the period of suspension will be suspended, and we may withhold all or any part of the Creator Earnings due to you but not yet paid out in accordance with section 13 of the Terms of Use for Creators.
        
    5. Upon termination of your account, we may deal with your Content in any appropriate manner in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://onlyfans.com/privacy) (including by deleting it) and you will no longer be entitled to access your Content.

    8. We can change the third-party payment providers used to process payments on OnlyFans and if we do so, we will notify you and store applicable details on your OnlyFans account.
    9. Other than Content (which is owned by or licensed to Creators), all rights in and to OnlyFans and its entire contents, features, databases, source code and functionality, are owned by us and/or our licensors. Such material is protected by copyright, and may be protected by trademark, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws.
    10. We are the sole and exclusive owners of any and all anonymised data relating to your use of OnlyFans and such anonymised data can be used by us for any purpose, including for commercial, development and research purposes.
9. **What we are not responsible for:** We will use reasonable care and skill in providing OnlyFans to you, but there are certain things which we are not responsible for, as follows:
    
    1. We do not authorize or approve Content on OnlyFans, and views expressed by Creators or Fans on OnlyFans do not necessarily represent our views.
    2. We do not grant you any rights in relation to Content. Any such rights may only be granted to you by Creators.
    3. Your Content may be viewed by individuals that recognise your identity. We will not in any way be responsible to you if you are identified from your Content. While we may, from time to time and in our sole discretion, offer certain geofencing or geolocation technology on OnlyFans, you understand and agree that we do not guarantee the accuracy or effectiveness of such technology, and you will have no claim against us arising from your use of or reliance upon any geofencing or geolocation technology on OnlyFans.
    4. All Content is created, selected, and provided by Users and not by us. We are not responsible for reviewing or moderating Content, and we do not select or modify the Content that is stored or transmitted via OnlyFans. We are under no obligation to monitor Content or to detect breaches of the Terms of Service (including the [Acceptable Use Policy](#acceptable-use-policy)).
    5. You agree that you have no obligation to follow any suggestions, comments, reviews, or instructions received from another User of OnlyFans and that if you choose to do so, you do so entirely at your own risk.
    6. We make no promises or guarantees of any kind that Creators or Referring Users will make a particular sum of money (or any money) from their use of OnlyFans (including the OnlyFans Referral Program).
    7. The materials which we make accessible on OnlyFans for Users are for general information only. We make no promises or guarantees about the accuracy or otherwise of such materials, or that Users will achieve any particular result or outcome from using such materials.
    8. We do not promise that OnlyFans is compatible with all devices and operating systems. You are responsible for configuring your information technology, device, and computer programs to access OnlyFans. You should use your own virus protection software.
    9. We are not responsible for the availability of the internet, or any errors in your connections, device or other equipment, or software that may occur in relation to your use of OnlyFans.
    10. While we try to make sure that OnlyFans is secure and free from bugs and viruses, we cannot promise that it will be and have no control over the Content that is supplied by Creators.
    11. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised User accounts, passwords, email accounts, or any resulting unauthorized activities or resulting unauthorized payments or withdrawals of funds.
    12. You acknowledge that once your Content is posted on OnlyFans, we cannot control and will not be responsible to you for the use which other Users or third parties make of such Content. You can delete your account at any time, but you acknowledge that deleting your account will not of itself prevent the circulation of any of your Content which may have been recorded by other Users in breach of the Terms of Service or by third parties prior to the deletion of your account.
10. **Intellectual property rights – ownership and licenses:**
    
    1. You confirm that you own all intellectual property rights (examples of which are copyright and trademarks) in your Content or that you have obtained all necessary rights to your Content which are required to grant licenses in respect of your Content to us and to other Users. This includes any rights required to engage in the acts covered by sub-section **10(b)** below in any territory in which OnlyFans is accessible and, in particular, in the United States of America, the United Kingdom and the European Union.
    2. You agree to grant us a license under all your Content to perform any act restricted by any intellectual property right (including copyright) in such Content, for any purpose reasonably related to the provision and operation of OnlyFans. Such acts include to reproduce, make available and communicate to the public, display, perform, distribute, translate, and create adaptations or derivative works of your Content, and otherwise deal in your Content.
    3. The license which you grant to us under sub-section **10(b)** above is perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, assignable and transferable by us. This means that the license will continue even after your agreement with us ends and you stop using OnlyFans, that we do not have to pay you for the license, and that we can grant a sub-license of your Content to someone else or assign or transfer the license to someone else. This license will allow us, for example, to add stickers, text, and watermarks to your Content, to make your Content available to other Users of OnlyFans, as well as to use your Content for other normal operations of OnlyFans. We will never sell your Content to other platforms, though we may sell or transfer any license you grant to us in the Terms of Service in the event of a sale of our company or its assets to a third party.
    4. Whilst we do not own your Content, you grant us the limited right to submit notifications of infringement (including of copyright or trademark) on your behalf to any third-party website or service that hosts or is otherwise dealing in infringing copies of your Content without your permission. Although we are not under any obligation to do so, we may at any time submit or withdraw any such notification to any third-party website or service where we consider it appropriate to do so. However, we do not and are under no obligation to police infringements of your Content. You agree that if we request, you will provide us with all consents and other information which we reasonably need to submit notifications of infringement on your behalf. Please see our [Complaints Policy](#complaints-policy) for how to make a complaint about infringement of intellectual property rights.
    5. You waive any moral rights which you may have under any applicable law to object to derogatory treatment of any Content posted by you on OnlyFans. This waiver does not affect in any way your ownership of any intellectual property rights in your Content or the rights which you have to prevent your Content from being copied without your permission. The waiver is intended to allow us when dealing with your Content (as permitted by the license which you give us in section **10(b)** above) to add watermarks, stickers or text to your Content.
11. **Twitter:** Users have the facility to connect an active Twitter account to their OnlyFans account and to share certain Content in the form of OnlyFans posts to Twitter using the share feature. If you use this feature, you must fully comply with Twitter's terms of service from time to time in respect of any Content shared in this way.
12. **Linking to and from OnlyFans:**
    
    1. Links to OnlyFans:
        
        * You may link to the OnlyFans homepage, provided you do so in a way that is fair and legal and does not damage our reputation or take advantage of it, but you must not establish a link in such a way as to suggest any form of association, approval, or endorsement on our part.
        * If you are a Creator, when promoting your Creator account you must comply with our Terms of Service and the terms of service of any other website where you place a link to or otherwise promote your Creator account. When promoting your Creator account, you must not impersonate OnlyFans or give the impression that your Creator account is being promoted by us if this is not the case. You must not promote your OnlyFans account by using Google Ads or any similar advertising platform or search engine advertising service.
    2. Links from OnlyFans: If OnlyFans contains links to other sites and resources provided by third parties, these links are provided for your convenience only. Such links should not be interpreted as approval by us of those linked websites or information you may obtain from them. We have no control over the contents of those sites or resources and accept no responsibility for them or for any loss or damage that may arise from your use of them. If you decide to access any of the third-party websites linked to OnlyFans, you do so entirely at your own risk and subject to the terms and conditions of use for such websites.
    3. Domain Names: In some instances, OnlyFans may allow Creators to register or use domain names that contain the OnlyFans trademark or a confusingly similar term. However, you will not register such a domain name, unless:
        
        * The domain name is registered by the Creator.
        * The domain name redirects to the Creator’s OnlyFans profile. Domain names containing the OnlyFans trademark or a confusingly similar term must not direct to any other website, including link aggregators.
        * The Creator obtains prior written permission from OnlyFans and signs a licensing agreement.
        
        If you would like to register a domain name containing the OnlyFans trademark or a confusingly similar term, please contact [support@onlyfans.com](mailto:support@onlyfans.com). Failing to comply with these provisions or the licensing agreement will be considered a violation of the licensing agreement and may result in OnlyFans filing a domain dispute against the registrant.
        
13. **How do I delete my account?** If you want to delete your OnlyFans account then you may do so in the 'User Account' section of your OnlyFans account.
    
    1. If you are a Fan, the deletion of your account will take place within a reasonable time following your request.
    2. If you are a Creator, then once you initiate the "**delete account**" process your account will remain open until the last day of your Fans' paid Subscription period, following which you will receive your final payment and your account will be deleted.
    3. If you are both a Fan and a Creator then your account will be deleted in two stages (Fan first and then Creator).
    4. Once your account has been deleted you won't be charged any further amounts or have access to your former OnlyFans account or its Content, and any subscriptions will be deleted and cannot be subsequently renewed. You will receive an email confirmation upon the successful deletion of your account. Once your account has been deleted, we may deal with your Content in any appropriate manner in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://onlyfans.com/privacy) (including by deleting it) and you will no longer be entitled to access your Content. There is no technical facility on OnlyFans for you to be able to access your Content following termination of your account.
14. **Who is responsible for any loss or damage suffered by you?**
    
    1. Whether you are a consumer or business User: We do not exclude or limit in any way our liability to you where it would be unlawful to do so.

            * won't be liable to you for any loss or damage, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty, or otherwise, even if foreseeable, arising out of or in connection with:
                
                * your inability to use OnlyFans or any of its services, features or programs; or

            * won't be liable to you if your Content is copied, distributed, reposted elsewhere or its copyright is infringed by another User or any third party;

            * USD 5,000.

    1. If any aspect of your agreement with us is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
    2. If we fail to enforce any aspect of your agreement with us, it will not be a waiver;
    3. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
    4. No implied licenses or other rights are granted to you in relation to any part of OnlyFans, save as expressly set out in the Terms of Service.

    6. You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under your agreement with us without our prior written consent.
    7. Our rights and obligations under your agreement with us can be assigned or transferred by us to others.

7. **Adult material:** You acknowledge that you are aware that some of the Content on OnlyFans contains adult material, and you agree to take this into account when deciding where to access and view Content. We will not be responsible to you if you suffer any loss or damage as a result of your accessing or viewing Content containing adult material in a way which places you in breach of any contract you have with a third party (for example, your employment contract) or in breach of any applicable law.
8. **Subscriptions and purchases by Fans:** This section describes the terms which apply to Fan/Creator Transactions:
    
    1. All Fan/Creator Transactions are contracts between Fans and Creators on the terms of the [Standard Contract between Fan and Creator](https://onlyfans.com/contract). Although we facilitate Fan/Creator Transactions by providing the OnlyFans platform and storing Content we are not a party to the [Standard Contract between Fan and Creator](https://onlyfans.com/contract) or any other contract which may exist between a Fan and Creator, and are not responsible for any Fan/Creator Transactions.
    2. Creators are solely responsible for determining (within the parameters for pricing on OnlyFans) the pricing applicable to Fan/Creator Transactions and the Content to which you may be given access. All prices appear in USD only.
    3. Fan Payments are exclusive of VAT, which shall be added at the current rate as applicable to Fan Payments.
    4. To be able to enter into a Fan/Creator Transaction with a particular Creator, you must first add a payment card to your account and then click the 'Subscribe' button on the relevant Creator's profile.
    5. You authorize us and our subsidiary companies to supply your payment card details to a third-party payment provider for the purpose of processing your Fan Payment. All Fan Payments will be charged in USD. Your payment card provider may charge you currency conversion fees. We do not have control over currency exchange rates or charges imposed by your payment card provider or bank and we and our subsidiary companies will not be responsible for paying any charges or fees imposed by your payment card provider or bank.
    6. If you choose to provide details of two or more payment cards, then if you try to make a Fan Payment from the first card and the card is rejected for any reason, then the other payment card will be used to collect the full Fan Payment.
    7. The payment provider will take (i) periodic payments from your payment card for Fan Payments which are Subscriptions; and (ii) immediate payments from your payment card for Fan Payments other than Subscriptions (including any tips paid by you to a Creator). You authorize and consent to each of these payments being debited using your supplied payment card details.
    8. Apart from free-trial Subscriptions, all Subscriptions to a Creator's profile will automatically renew at the end of the relevant subscription period, except if your payment card is declined, the subscription price for the Subscription has increased, or you have turned off the "Auto-Renew" switch located on the relevant Creator's profile. This means that if you want to stop subscribing to a Creator's profile and paying continuing monthly subscription charges, you will need to turn off the "Auto-Renew" switch located on the relevant Creator's profile.
    9. If you cancel a Subscription you will continue to be permitted to view the relevant Creator's Content until the end of the subscription period in which you cancelled, after which no further payments will be taken from your payment card in respect of subscriptions to that Creator's profile (unless you choose to pay for a new Subscription to that Creator’s profile), and you will no longer be able to view the relevant Creator's Content.
    10. You agree that you will not make unjustified requests for a refund in respect of any Fan/Creator Transaction or tip to a Creator, or unjustified chargeback requests of your payment card provider in relation to any Fan/Creator Transaction or tip to a Creator. If we consider that any request for a refund or chargeback request was made by you in bad faith, we have the right to suspend or delete your User account.
    11. Wallet credits: You can prepay an amount on OnlyFans (known as "Wallet Credits") which you can later use to make Fan Payments. Purchases on OnlyFans cannot be divided - if you attempt a purchase that costs more than the total amount of your remaining Wallet Credits, your payment card will be charged the full amount for that purchase. Wallet Credits are subject to a maximum amount as determined by us from time to time. Interest will not accrue on Wallet Credits. Wallet Credits are non-refundable, which means that you are not entitled to a refund of any unused Wallet Credits.
9. **Suspension of your User account:** If we suspend your User account in accordance with our rights under the Terms of Service, then any Fan Payments which would otherwise have fallen due during the period of suspension of your User account will be suspended during the period of the suspension of your User account.

REFERRAL PROGRAM TERMS
======================

WARNING!
--------

In compliance with regulation 3 of the Trading Scheme Regulations 1997 (as amended) and section 120(1) of the Fair Trading Act 1973, please read the warning below in respect of the OnlyFans Referral Program:

* It is illegal for us or for a participant in the OnlyFans Referral Program (including Referring Users and Referred Creators) to persuade anyone to make a payment by promising benefits from getting others to join the OnlyFans Referral Program.
* Do not be misled by claims that high earnings are easily achieved from participation in the OnlyFans Referral Program.
* Although we do not demand any payment from Referring Users for the purposes of participating in the OnlyFans Referral Program, we are legally required to inform you that if you sign this contract, you have 14 days in which to cancel and get your money back.

1. **Introduction:** These Referral Program Terms are additional terms which apply if you use the OnlyFans Referral Program. These Referral Program Terms form part of your agreement with us.
2. **Interpretation:** In these Referral Program Terms defined terms have the same meanings given to them in the [Terms of Use for all Users](#terms-use-all-users). In addition:
    
    1. "**Referring User**" is also referred to as "**you**" or "**your**" in these Referral Program Terms;
    2. "**Referred Creator**" means the person who joins OnlyFans as a Creator via the Referring User's unique referral link.
3. **What is the OnlyFans Referral Program?** OnlyFans offers a referral program by which existing Users can introduce people who are interested in becoming Creators to OnlyFans and receive referral payments from OnlyFans which are calculated and limited as described in these Referral Program Terms.
    
    The OnlyFans Referral Program is operated by Fenix International Limited. We are a limited company registered in England and Wales, with company registration number 10354575 and we have our registered office address at 9th Floor, 107 Cheapside, London, EC2V 6DN.
    
4. **The rules of the OnlyFans Referral Program:**
    
    1. Only Users of OnlyFans with a current User account can participate in the OnlyFans Referral Program. If a User's account has been suspended or terminated by us for any reason or deleted by the User, that User will not be eligible to participate in the OnlyFans Referral Program.
    2. You will need on your User account page to add a bank account or a payment method details of your bank account or a payment method in order to receive referral payments under the OnlyFans Referral Program.
    3. Each User has a unique referral link (which can be accessed via the User's User account) which the User may share with others. When sharing your unique referral link you must not impersonate OnlyFans or give the impression that your referral link is being shared or promoted by us. You must not use Google Ads or any similar advertising platform or search engine advertising service to share or promote your unique referral link. Upon our request, you must disclose the methods by which you share your unique referral link in the Bio/Website field of your OnlyFans account.
    4. The Referred Creator must click on your unique referral link and then register with OnlyFans using the same browser that they used to click on your unique referral link. If someone registers with OnlyFans other than by using your unique referral link, we will not link that account to your referral and no referral payments will be made to you.
    5. The Referred Creator must not have opened a User account with OnlyFans (whether under the same name or another name) before clicking on your unique referral link. If the Referred Creator is currently or has previously been a User of OnlyFans no referral payments will be made to you for the referral.
    6. If the Referred Creator sets up more than one User account referral payments will be made to you on the earnings made by the Referred Creator from their first User account only. No referral payments will be made to you on any further User accounts set up by the Referred Creator.
    7. No referral payments will be made to you on any referral of a Referred Creator which we determine is owned or operated by you, or is in a commercial relationship with you. You will provide any information which we request to enable us to determine whether the Referred Creator is owned or operated by you or if there is a commercial relationship between you and the Referred Creator.
    8. You agree that when promoting OnlyFans in any way as a Referring User:
        
        * you will not give a false impression of OnlyFans, the services, programs, and content (including Content) made available through OnlyFans, its Users or the Terms of Service; and
        * you will not make any statements which suggest to a potential Creator that the potential Creator will make a particular sum of money (or any money) from their use of OnlyFans, or any statements regarding the likely number of Fans.
5. **Referral payments:**
    
    1. **How are referral payments calculated?** Once a Referred Creator has become a registered User of OnlyFans in accordance with the rules of the OnlyFans Referral Program described above, the Referring User will be paid a referral payment equal to five per cent (5%) of Fan Payments generated by the Referred Creator in the twelve months after the date on which the Referred Creator becomes a registered User of OnlyFans, up to a maximum referral payment by OnlyFans to the Referring User of US$50,000 per Referred Creator.
        
        This means that if a Referred Creator generates Fan Payments with a total value of US$1 million or more in the twelve months after the date on which that Referred Creator becomes a registered User of OnlyFans, then the Referring User's referral payments in relation to that Referred Creator will be capped at US$50,000 in total. However, if the Referred Creator generates Fan Payments with a total value of less than US$1 million in the twelve months after the date on which that Referred Creator becomes a registered User of OnlyFans, then the Referring User will be paid five per cent (5%) of the Fan Payments generated by that Referred Creator in the twelve months after the date on which the Referred Creator becomes a registered User of OnlyFans, following which no further referral payments will be made to the Referring User in respect of that Referred Creator.
        
        For all referrals made prior to 1 May 2020, referral payments will be made to the relevant Referring Users until 1 May 2021 or until US$50,000 has been paid out to the Referring User on the referral, whichever occurs first.
        
    2. **VAT:** If you are a Referring User you should know that all referral payments payable to you by us will be inclusive of any VAT (as defined in the [Terms of Use for Creators](#terms-use-creators)) which is or becomes chargeable on any supplies made by you, except as provided for in the " [Promoting Tax compliance and VAT](#promoting-tax-compliance-vat)" section of the [Terms of Use for Creators](#terms-use-creators).
    3. **Warning:** In compliance with regulation 3 of the Trading Scheme Regulations 1997 (as amended) and section 120(1) of the Fair Trading Act 1973, please read the warning below in respect of the OnlyFans Referral Program:
        
        * It is illegal for us or for a participant in the OnlyFans Referral Program (including Referring Users and Referred Creators) to persuade anyone to make a payment by promising benefits from getting others to join the OnlyFans Referral Program.
        * Do not be misled by claims that high earnings are easily achieved from participation in the OnlyFans Referral Program.
    4. **Choosing a payout method to receive referral payments:** In order to be able to receive referral payments you must first choose one of the payout methods provided by OnlyFans in your country of residence. These methods are called "Payout Options".
    5. **How frequently are referral payments made?** The referral payment due to you on Fan Payments made to the Referred Creator in a calendar month will be transferred to you on or around the first day of the next calendar month (which means, for example, that referral payments due to you in respect of Fan Payments made to the Referred Creator in February shall be paid to you on or around 1 March).
    6. **Who bears the cost of the referral payment?** The cost of the referral payment is borne by us, not the Referred Creator.
6. **Our rights relating to the referral program.**
    
    1. If referral payments have been made incorrectly then we have the right to recover the wrongly paid sums from the User to whom the wrongly paid sums have been paid.
    2. We may request you or Referred Creators (or both) to provide us with ID and other information reasonably required by us to verify any referral payment to be made and the person to whom any referral payment should be made. Failure to provide any information requested by us may lead to you losing your entitlement to referral payments in respect of the relevant Referred Creator.
    3. We may change any aspect of the OnlyFans Referral Program (including how referral payments are calculated) or discontinue the OnlyFans Referral Program at any time, but no change will deprive any Referring User of referral payments already earned based on Fan Payments made to Referred Creators before the changes came into effect.
7. **Circumstances in which we may withhold referral payments:**
    
    1. We may withhold all or any part of the referral payments due to you but not yet paid out:
        
        * if we think that you have or may have seriously or repeatedly breached any part of the Terms of Service;
        * if you attempt or threaten to breach any part of the Terms of Service in a way which has or could have serious consequences for us or another User (including actual or possible loss caused to us or another User); or
        * if we suspect that all or any part of the referral payments due to you result from unlawful or fraudulent activity, either by you, by the Fan who made the Fan Payment to the Referred Creator which resulted in the referral payment, or by the Referred Creator to whom the Fan Payment was made which resulted in the referral payment,
        
        for as long as is necessary to investigate the actual, threatened or suspected breach(es) by you or the suspected unlawful or fraudulent activity (as applicable). If following our investigation, we conclude that (i) you have seriously or repeatedly breached any part of the Terms of Service; (ii) you have attempted or threatened to breach any part of the Terms of Service in a way which has or could have serious consequences for us or another User (including actual or possible loss caused to us or another User), and/or (iii) all or any part of referral payments due to you result from unlawful or fraudulent activity, we may notify you that you have forfeited all or any part of your referral payments.
        
    2. We may also withhold all or any part of the referral payments due to you but not yet paid out if we receive notice that you have secured, encumbered, pledged, assigned, or otherwise allowed a lien to be placed on, referral payments. We undertake no duty to pay referral payments to third-party lienholders and may withhold payment of Creator Earnings until the lien has been removed.
    3. We shall not have any responsibility to you if we withhold or forfeit any payment due to you under the OnlyFans Referral Program where we have a right to do so under these Referral Program Terms.
    4. If we are withholding all or any part of the referral payments due to you and we determine that part of the referral payments withheld by us is unrelated to breaches by you of the Terms of Service or suspected unlawful or fraudulent activity, then we may arrange for you to be paid the part of the referral payments which is unrelated to breaches by you of the Terms of Service or suspected unlawful or fraudulent activity. However, you agree that if we consider that your breach(es) of the Terms of Service has or may cause us loss, we may withhold all referral payments due to you but not yet paid and we may set off such amounts against any losses suffered by us.
