A cookie does not contain or collect information in isolation, but when read by a server via a web browser; it can give information to facilitate a more user friendly service such as detecting errors. A cookie will not harm your computer and no personally identifiable information is stored from the use of this site. For more information on how cookies are used on this site, please see **How We Use Cookies**

Most web browsers have cookies automatically enabled; however, see **Managing Cookies** where you can find out how you can check your cookie settings. If you make no changes to the standard settings, then please be aware that you accept the browsers standard settings and accept that cookies are active.

3.0 How we use cookies
----------------------

You may notice the presence of different types of cookies generated on your visit to this website. We use the following types of cookies:

– Session cookies, which are automatically deleted after every visit.  
– Persistent cookies that will remain in place during multiple visits to the site.  
– Tracking cookies are specialized versions of cookies that are placed on our own website and other websites that record your entries and report them back to us.  
– Third party cookies, which are used by partner websites that are embedded within our site or that we link to.

4.0 Session cookies
-------------------

These enable you to perform essential functions on the site, such as remembering a repeat form field item within a browsing session. In addition, they help by limiting the need to transfer information across the Internet. They are not stored on your computer and will expire when you terminate your browser session.

5.0 Persistent cookies
----------------------

These enable us to recognize anonymous repeat visitors to the site. By matching an anonymous, randomly generated identifier, a record can be taken of specific browsing information such as how you arrive at the site, the pages you view, options you select, and the path taken through the site. By monitoring this information we’re able to make improvements to the site, including the fixing of errors and the enhancement of content.

We use Google Analytics to analyze page use, page interactions and the routes taken through our sites. These are known as ‘website metrics’ or ‘analytics’. We do not record any personal information as part of this process.

6.0 Tracking cookies
--------------------

The aim of tracking cookies is often to collect certain information to carry out various research into behavior, demographics and not least for targeted marketing. Third-parties may use these on our site and we may place such cookies on third party websites.

7.0 3rd Party Cookies
---------------------

When you visit our site you may notice some cookies that are not related to our company. If you go on to a web page that contains embedded content, for example from Facebook or YouTube, you may be sent cookies from these websites. We do not control the generation of these cookies, so we suggest that you check the individual third-party websites for more information about their privacy policies and their cookies and how to manage them.

8.0 How are cookies used for advertising purposes?
--------------------------------------------------

Cookies and ad technology such as web beacons, pixels, and anonymous ad network tags help us serve relevant ads to you more effectively. They also help us collect aggregated audit data, research, and performance reporting for advertisers. Pixels enable us to understand and improve the delivery of ads to you, and know when certain ads have been shown to you. Since your web browser may request advertisements and web beacons directly from ad network servers, these networks can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.  
We do use cookies to create a profile of your browsing behavior on third-party sites and we do use aggregate data from third parties to show you relevant, interest-based advertising. We do not provide any personal information that we collect to advertisers. You can opt out of off-site and third-party-informed advertising by adjusting your cookie settings. Opting out will not remove advertising from the pages you visit, but, instead, opting out will result in the ads you see not being matched to your interests. This implies that the ad(s) you see will not be matched to your interests by those specific cookies.
