This Privacy Policy is published by Simplifi Holdings, Inc. (“Simplifi,” “we” or “us”) and describes how we collect, receive, use, retain, process, disclose, transfer, and secure Personal Information on our website located at [http://simpli.fi](http://simpli.fi/), our online client portal located at [App.simpli.fi](http://app.simpli.fi/), and other websites or apps for our clients that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Site”). It also describes your choices regarding use, access, deletion, and correction of your Personal Information. The Site is intended for our business clients. Our clients, including advertisers or publishers, are referred to in this Policy as “Advertising Customers.” All references to “you,” “your” or “user” apply to Advertising Customers and any other person viewing, using or accessing the Site and its features and services. For information about our data practices when we carry out our advertising services, please review our [Privacy Policy for our Services](https://simpli.fi/simpli-fi-services-privacy-policy/).

“Personal Information” in this Policy is information about you that is personally identifying, such as your name, email address, or telephone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. The definition of Personal Information depends on the laws that apply in your location, and may include other types of information as well, such as location data, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, or other unique identifier. This Privacy Policy covers information we collect online only, unless local law requires otherwise.

Changes to This Policy
----------------------

This Privacy Policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically for any changes. If we make any material changes we will notify you by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. If you do not agree to such changes, you must immediately stop using the Site.

Information We Collect
----------------------

Users can browse the Site without logging in or providing any Personal Information. Providing Personal Information is necessary to become an Advertising Customer and to access certain features and services available on the Site. For example, we will request your name, contact information, company information, and payment information. When users register and log in as Advertising Customers, we collect an email address and password. When users request a demo or otherwise contact us with inquiries, we collect the Personal Information needed to respond like a name, email address, and phone number. When users connect to the Site from a social media platform, we collect the Personal Information you have provided to that particular social media platform in accordance with the social media platform’s privacy practices and your settings on that platform.  
Users can also register as an Advertising Customer and pay for our services by phone. When users call to register, we collect your name, contact information, company information, and payment information to enable us to process the transaction and set up and manage the user’s account.  
When users apply for a job with Simplifi, we collect Personal Information such as contact information and other Personal Information provided by the user on his or her resume or C.V.  
It is always your choice whether or not to provide us with the Personal Information described above. If you do not provide the necessary Personal Information you will not be able to become an Advertising Customer and you will not be able to access our advertising services or other services available on the Site. We also will have no way to respond to your questions or inquiries or to provide a demo or other requested services.  
When users access our Site, we collect certain information automatically including IP addresses and cookie identifiers. We collect information about your device and your visit(s), such as browser type and version, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.  
We and our third-party vendors use cookies or similar technologies (such as web beacons and pixels) to analyze trends, administer and improve the Site, deliver more relevant advertising, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You may be able to remove persistent cookies using tools in your browser. We do not store Personal Information in cookies. If you reject cookies, you may still navigate our Site, but your ability to use some areas of the Site may be limited. For more information, please see our [Cookie Policy](https://simpli.fi/simpli-fi-cookie-policy/). For more information on Google’s data collection practices visit [Google’s Policies and Terms](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).

How We Use Your Information
---------------------------

We use your information to operate and improve our business and provide the services you have requested, such as to receive information about our products and services, to become and to interact with us as an Advertising Customer, to process your billings, for our legal compliance, to be contacted in regard to an employment opportunity or to provide you with customer service. We also send you marketing materials, including by using your email address to send you email updates and promotional materials from or about Simplifi if you are a U.S. resident or if you are an E.U. resident and have opted in to receive promotional emails. You may unsubscribe from promotional emails at any time by clicking “unsubscribe” on the emails you receive from us.

Information Sharing and Disclosure
----------------------------------

We will not sell, trade or share your Personal Information with other companies for their direct marketing purposes, unless we have your consent.

We may share the information we collect with other parties for other reasons, including the following:

*   With our affiliates and third party vendors who provide services on our behalf, such as an email marketing company who distributes our newsletters to our users, and our third party payment processors who process your transactions. These companies are authorized to use your Personal Information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
*   Simplifi may also disclose any information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) comply with the law or comply with legal process served on Simplifi, (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Simplifi; (3) protect the personal safety of users of Simplifi, its Site and other services, or the public; (4) provide updates and services that may be of interest to the user; or (5) prevent online fraud or other cyber threats, for example through an online threat exchange, or to report, detect and/or prevent security events.
*   Simplifi is required to disclose Personal Information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
*   We may disclose Personal Information with your consent.

Sale of Assets
--------------

In the event that Simplifi is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, including in bankruptcy, we reserve the right to include, disclose and transfer any or all stored Personal Information and other data among the assets transferred to the acquiring company. If this occurs, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership or material changes in uses of your Personal Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Information.

YOUR CHOICES
------------

**Email Marketing**  
You may unsubscribe from Simplifi’s promotional emails at any time by clicking “unsubscribe” on the emails you receive from us.

**Opting Out of Simplifi Targeted Advertising on Your Browser**  
Simplifi collects data on the Site and across non-affiliated websites and apps to deliver more relevant advertising to you. This process is called interest-based advertising. Simplifi also collects information about potential relationships among different devices for interest-based advertising. If you would like to stop receiving interest-based advertising on your browser from Simplifi, [click here](https://optout.simpli.fi/opt-out). By doing so, Simplifi will replace your unique cookie with an “opt-out” cookie. An opt-out choice means that we no longer use or transfer data from the opted out browser for targeted advertisements, and we no longer use data collected on other devices to inform advertisements on that device. We will still collect and store information through such cookies for other purposes such as metrics and analytics and we may still serve you advertising but it will not be tailored for you. Because cookies are browser specific, if you use more than one browser or device, you will need to make your opt-out choice on each browser or device that you use. To do so, point each browser that you use to this page, and click on the disable link above. Please note that you will need to set the Simplifi opt-out cookie again in some cases, for example, under the following circumstances: You buy a new computer, delete cookies from your browser, or upgrade the browser of your existing computer.

Simplifi is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and adheres to the NAI Code of Conduct. Additional information on the NAI and its code can be viewed at [http://www.networkadvertising.org/code-enforcement/code](http://www.networkadvertising.org/code-enforcement/code).

Simplifi also licenses the AdChoices icon from the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) at [http://digitaladvertisingalliance.org](http://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/)/ and the DAAC at [http://youradchoices.ca](http://youradchoices.ca/) for the purpose of providing enhanced notice and to inform users when they are being behaviorally targeted and to provide an opportunity to opt out.  
Simplifi makes every effort to ensure adherence to the self-regulatory principles of the DAA and the DAAC.

For information about opting out of Simplifi’s other interest-based advertising activities outside the Site, please see our Services Privacy Policy.

**JavaScript**  
We also use JavaScript to assist us with the collection and use of browsing data, including IP address and cookie identifiers, for interest-based advertising activities.

**Do Not Track**  
We currently honor Do Not Track signals transmitted by browsers by treating this signal as an opt out of interest-based advertising.

**Third-Party Targeted Advertising**  
We partner with one or more third parties to display advertising on our Site and/or to manage our advertising on other sites. Such third parties may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this Site and other unrelated sites over time in order to provide you with more relevant advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. This is called interest-based advertising. Simpli.fi complies with the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Principles and the NAI Code of Conduct in connection with this activity on our Site. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out with respect to companies participating in industry self-regulation by clicking [http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1) or [http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/), or if located in the European Union click [http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/). Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive ads, but they will not be targeted based on your browsing activity.

Accessing Your Information
--------------------------

You may request to access your Personal Information that we hold, as well as to correct, amend or delete information when it has been processed in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles or when otherwise required by law. To make such requests, please contact us at [privacy@simpli.fi](mailto:privacy@simpli.fi). We will respond to these requests in accordance with the laws that apply to you and within a reasonable timeframe. You can help us maintain the accuracy of your information by notifying us of any changes to your information. We may deny a request in some cases when permitted by law, such as when the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.

INTERNATIONAL OR CROSS-BORDER TRANSFER OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND YOUR EXPRESS AGREEMENT
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By providing Personal Information and/or by communicating with us by email, you acknowledge and expressly consent to our processing and disclosure of your Personal Information outside your country. The Personal Information of users who are located outside the U.S. may be transferred outside of each eligible country to the U.S., where our servers are located and where it will be processed and stored on servers in the U.S. **By accessing the Site, using Advertising Services, providing Personal Information or sending us email, you expressly and unambiguously agree to such transfer, processing, storage and disclosure in countries outside your own.**

EU DATA SUBJECTS: PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------------

We process Personal Information with your consent. On other occasions, we may process Personal Information when we need to do so to fulfill a contract (for example, for billing purposes) or where required to do this by law. If necessary, we may also process Personal Information when it is in our legitimate interests to do this (e.g., for auditing purposes or for fraud detection) and when these interests are not overridden by your data protection rights.

EU data subjects may have rights to access, portability, to revoke consent, to correct, delete, and/or object to or restrict processing of the Personal Information you provide to us. You can email a request to us at [privacy@simpli.fi](mailto:privacy@simpli.fi). We will respond to your request in a reasonable timeframe and in accordance with the law that applies to you. Sometimes a request in relation to your Personal Information may not apply to certain information, such as information we may keep to comply with legal requirements.

Additionally, you have the right to lodge a complaint against us. To do so, contact the supervisory authority in your country of residence.

EU-U.S. PRIVACY SHIELD AND SWISS-U.S. PRIVACY SHIELD
----------------------------------------------------

Simplifi participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.
