To the extent it is necessary in order for SoundCloud to provide you with any of the aforementioned hosting services, to undertake any of the tasks set forth in these Terms of Use and/or to enable your use of the Platform, you hereby grant such licences to SoundCloud on a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully paid basis.

You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless SoundCloud, its successors, assigns, affiliates, agents, directors, officers, employees and shareholders from and against any and all claims, obligations, damages, losses, expenses, and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, resulting from:

(i) any violation by you of these Terms of Use or our Community Guidelines;

(ii) any third party claim of infringement of copyright or other intellectual property rights or invasion of privacy arising from the hosting of Your Content on the Platform, and/or your making available thereof to other users of the Platform, and/or the actual use of Your Content by other users of the Platform or Linked Services in accordance with these Terms of Use and the parameters set by you with respect to the distribution and sharing of Your Content;

(iii) any activity related to your account, be it by you or by any other person accessing your account with or without your consent unless such activity was caused by the act or default of SoundCloud.

Data Protection, Privacy and Cookies

All personal data that you provide to us in connection with your use of the Platform is collected, stored, used and disclosed by SoundCloud in accordance with our Privacy Policy. In addition, in common with most online services, we use cookies to help us understand how people are using the Platform, so that we can continue to improve the service we offer. Our use of cookies, and how to disable cookies, is explained in our Cookies Policy. By accepting these Terms of Use and using the Platform, you also accept the terms of the Privacy Policy and our Cookies Policy.

Meetups

SoundCloud has an active community of users, many of whom organize and attend face-to-face meetings at venues all over the world (“**Meetups**”). While SoundCloud is generally supportive of Meetups and may provide branded promotional materials to help organisers promote their Meetups, SoundCloud does not sponsor, oversee or in any way control such Meetups. You hereby acknowledge and agree that your attendance and participation in any Meetups is entirely at your own risk and SoundCloud does not bear any responsibility or liability for the actions of any SoundCloud users or any third parties who organize, attend or are otherwise involved in any Meetups.

Competitions and Other Promotions

From time to time, some SoundCloud® users may promote competitions, promotions, prize draws and other similar opportunities on the Platform (“**Third Party Competitions**”). SoundCloud is not the sponsor or promoter of these Third Party Competitions, and does not bear any responsibility or liability for the actions or inactions of any third parties who organize, administer or are otherwise involved in any of promotion of these Third Party Competitions. If you wish to participate in any of these Third Party Competitions, it is your responsibility to read the terms and conditions applicable to the relevant Third Party Competition and to ensure that you understand the rules and any eligibility requirements, and are lawfully able to participate in such Third Party Competitions in your country of residence.

If you wish to run your own Third Party Competition on the Platform, you are free to do so provided you comply with our Competition Terms, which are available here.

Use of SoundCloud Players and Widget

The Platform includes access to customisable players (“**Players**”), and an embeddable version of the SoundCloud waveform player (“**Widget**”) for incorporation into users’ own sites, third party sites or social media profiles, whether or not a Linked Service. This functionality is provided to enable Uploaders to put their Content wherever they wish, and to enable other users of the Platform to share and distribute Content within the parameters set by the Uploader.

You may not, without the prior written consent of SoundCloud, use the Players or the Widget in such a way that you aggregate Content from the Platform into a separate destination that replicates substantially the offering of the Website, or comprises a content service of which Content from the Platform forms a material part. Similarly, you may not, without the prior written consent of SoundCloud, use the Players or the Widget to embed Content into any website or other destination dedicated to a particular artist (except where the relevant Content is Your Content and you are the person or are authorised to represent the person to whom the site or destination is dedicated), or to a particular genre. You may not use the Players or Widget in any way that suggests that SoundCloud or any artist, audio creator or other third party endorses or supports your website, or your use of the Players or Widget. The foregoing shall apply whether such use is commercial or non-commercial.

SoundCloud reserves the right to block your use of the Players and the Widget at any time and for any reason in its sole discretion.

Pro Accounts and Gift Codes

Certain features of the Platform are only available to registered users who subscribe for a “Pro” or “Pro Unlimited” account (together, “**Pro Accounts**”).

The purchase of Pro Accounts and gift codes is subject to additional terms, which you will find here. These terms include, amongst other things, terms relating to payment, the conclusion and renewal of your contract, your right of cancellation during the first 14 days of your subscription, and certain technical usage limitations.

These additional terms are applicable to Pro Account users in addition to these general Terms of Use.

Changes to the Platform, Accounts and Pricing

SoundCloud reserves the right at any time and for any reason to suspend, discontinue, terminate or cease providing access to the Platform or any part thereof, temporarily or permanently, and whether in its entirety or with respect to individual territories only. In the case of any temporary or permanent suspension, discontinuation, termination or cessation of access, SoundCloud shall use its reasonable endeavours to notify registered users of such decision in advance.

You hereby agree that SoundCloud and its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns, employees, agents, directors, officers and shareholders shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any changes or modifications to the Website, Apps and/or any Services that SoundCloud may wish to make from time to time, or for any decision to suspend, discontinue or terminate the Website, the Services or any part or parts thereof, or your possibility to use or access the same from or within any territory or territories.

SoundCloud may change the features of any type of account, may withdraw or, or introduce new features, products or types of account at any time and for any reason, and may change the prices charged for any of its Pro Accounts from time to time. In the event of any increase in the price or material reduction in the features of any Pro Account to which you have subscribed, such change(s) will be communicated to you and will only take effect with respect to any subsequent renewal of your subscription. In all other cases, where SoundCloud proposes to make changes to any type of account to which you subscribe (Pro Account or otherwise), and these changes are material and to your disadvantage, SoundCloud will notify you of the proposed changes by sending a message to your SoundCloud® account and/or an email to the then current email address that we have for your account, at least six (6) weeks in advance. You will have no obligation to continue using the Platform following any such notification, but if you do not terminate your account as described in the Termination section below during such six (6) week period, your continued use of your account after the end of that six (6) week period will constitute your acceptance of the changes to your account.

Termination

You may terminate this Agreement at any time by sending notice in writing to SoundCloud at Rheinsberger Str. 76/77, 10115 Berlin, Germany confirming such termination, by removing all of Your Content from your account, by deleting your account and thereafter by ceasing to use the Platform. If you have a Pro Account, and terminate this Agreement before the end of your subscription, we are unable to offer any refund for any unexpired period of your subscription.

SoundCloud may suspend your access to the Platform and/or terminate this Agreement at any time if (i) you are deemed to be a Repeat Infringer as described above. (ii) you are in breach of any of the material provision of these Terms of Use or our Community Guidelines, including without limitation, the provisions of the following sections: Your Use of the Platform, Your Content, Grant of Licence , and Your Representations and Warranties. (iii) SoundCloud elects at its discretion to cease providing access to the Platform in the jurisdiction where you reside or from where you are attempting to access the Platform, or (iv) in other reasonable circumstances as determined by SoundCloud at its discretion. If you have a Pro Account and your account is suspended or terminated by SoundCloud pursuant to (i) or (ii) above, you will not be entitled to any refund for any unexpired period of your subscription. If your account is terminated pursuant to (iii) or (iv), refunds may be payable at the reasonable discretion of SoundCloud.

Once your account has been terminated, any and all Content residing in your account, or pertaining to activity from your account (for example, data relating to the distribution or consumption of your sounds), will be irretrievably deleted by SoundCloud, except to the extent that we are obliged or permitted to retain such content, data or information for a certain period of time in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and/or to protect our legitimate business interests. You are advised to save or back up any material that you have uploaded to your account before terminating your account, as SoundCloud assumes no liability for any material that is irretrievably deleted following any termination of your account. SoundCloud is not able to provide you with any .csv or other similar file of data relating to activity associated with your account, whether before or after termination or cancellation. This data is provided and is accessible only for viewing via your account page on the Website for as long as your account is active.

If you access the Platform via any of our Apps or via any third party app connected to your account, deleting that app will not delete your account. If you wish to delete your account, you will need to do so from the Account page within your Settings on the Website.
