When you use the Wild Sky Media Sites on Facebook or use your login credentials from Facebook or another social network service, we may collect and record the information you provide us voluntarily through Facebook or other social network service in accordance with the policies and terms of Facebook or other social network service and your settings with that service. The types of personal information collected may vary depending on your activity, social network settings, and the permissions you grant, but may include your name, Facebook user identification number, email address, gender, current city, profile picture, and age or date of birth.

**Location Data**  
If you consent to allow a Wild Sky Media Site or one of our partners access information about your location, we may collect information about your precise location and share it with third parties for the purpose showing ads that are targeted to your interests. We also use your IP address to derive information about your general location (for example, your city or town).

**Automatically Collected Information**  
When you interact with a Wild Sky Media Site or a website, we collect certain information about your mobile device or computer system, including your browser type, browser language, platform type, MAC Address, IP Address, mobile advertising ID, Facebook ID, cookie information, and information about your interactions with the Wild Sky Media Sites, such as referring / exit pages and URLs, clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order in which those pages were viewed, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time of your request.

When you subscribe to a Wild Sky Media mailing list, we collect and use your email address to communicate directly with you on one or more of our site newsletters. Each email you receive from any of our sites will include details on how to manage your newsletter preferences and unsubscribe.

**Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies**  
We and our partners, affiliates, and analytics and other providers use technologies such as cookies, beacons, pixels, tags, scripts, and SDKs to analyze trends, administer the Wild Sky Media Sites, advertise, and to gather demographic information about our users. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.

Cookies are a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters that help us improve the Wild Sky Media Sites and your experience, see which areas and features of the Wild Sky Media Sites are popular, and count visits. Web beacons are electronic images that may be used in the Wild Sky Media Sites or emails and help deliver cookies, count visits, and understand usage and campaign effectiveness. An SDK is a piece of computer code that developers include in their mobile applications.

**Information We Collect from Other Sources**  
Wild Sky Media and partners that use Wild Sky Media technology may obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through the Wild Sky Media Sites or our partners’ services. For example, we may collect information about you from third parties, including but not limited to identity verification services, advertisers, mailing list providers, and publicly available sources.

**THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISERS**  
Wild Sky Media allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Wild Sky Media Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, device, or mobile application, the advertisements and links that appear on the Wild Sky Media Sites or our partners’ sites. These third parties automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, SDKs, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. Wild Sky Media does not provide any personal information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Wild Sky Media to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the target audience.

**USE OF INFORMATION**  
We use the information we collect to operate, maintain, and provide you the features and functionality of the Wild Sky Media Sites. We also use the information we collect to show ads and report on how they perform, including to show ads that are targeted to users’ interests across their devices, limiting the number of times users see ads, customizing ads to users’ locations, determining how users respond to ads, and reporting on the effectiveness of ads. If you subscribe to one of our newsletters, we will use your email address to deliver that newsletter to your email account. Finally, we use the data we collect to protect the rights of Wild Sky Media and others, including to detect, prevent, investigate, and deter fraudulent, unauthorized, or illegal activity.

**SHARING OF INFORMATION**  
Wild Sky Media will not share, sell, rent or trade information that identifies you other than as described in this privacy policy. Wild Sky Media may share information that identifies you as follows:

*   With vendors, consultants and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf;
*   When you post information publicly, such as in discussion boards, messages and chat areas, within your public profile page, etc., that information will be publicly available;
*   In response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law or legal process, including lawful requests by public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements;
