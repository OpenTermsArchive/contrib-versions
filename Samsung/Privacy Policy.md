    _Information About Your Use of Services_
    
    In addition to the information you provide, we will collect information about your use of our Services through software on your devices and by other means. We will collect:

    *   **Samsung Keyboard information** The words that you type when you enable Predictive text.

    We sometimes gather publicly or commercially available information, including information from social networks you use, and combine this with other information about you so that we can better understand your needs, interests, and preferences.

    _Other Information We Collect_
    
    We may also collect other information about you, your devices, or your use of Services that you consent to send us.

    Through certain Services, we may collect personal information about your online activities on websites and connected devices over time and across third-party websites, devices, apps and other online features and services. We may use third-party analytics services on the Services, such as those of Google Analytics. The service providers that administer these analytics services help us to analyse your use of the Services and improve the Services. The information we obtain may be disclosed to or collected directly by these providers and other relevant third parties who use the information, for example, to evaluate use of the Services, help administer the Services and diagnose technical issues. To learn more about Google Analytics, please visit [http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html) and [https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/).
    
      
    
    _Your Options_
    
    You can choose not to provide us with certain types of information, such as information requested as part of registering a Samsung account. In some cases, this may limit your ability to use some Services. We’ll do our best to explain these limitations when we’re asking for your information so you can make an informed decision. For example, Samsung Cloud allows you to back up your information and create a restore point; however, Samsung Cloud was not designed nor intended to store or process sensitive information.

    For some apps and services, including social networks, we receive and store sign-in information, as well as other information that you allow us to receive when you connect with these apps and services.
    
*   ### [COOKIES, BEACONS, AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES](javascript:void(0))

    **Cookies**
    
    Cookies are small files that store information on your computer, TV, mobile phone, or other device. They enable the entity that put the cookie on your device to recognize you across different websites, services, devices, and browsing sessions. Cookies serve many useful purposes. For example:
    
    *   Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you don’t have to enter those credentials each time you sign in to a service.
    *   Cookies help us and third parties understand which parts of our Services are the most popular because they help us to see which pages and features visitors are accessing and how much time they’re spending on the pages. Studying this information helps us to adapt the Services and provide you with a better experience.
    *   Cookies help us and third parties understand which ads you’ve seen so you don’t get the same ad each time you access a Service.
    *   Cookies help us and third parties to provide you with relevant content and advertising by collecting information about your use of our Services and other websites and apps.
    
    When you use a web browser to access Services, you can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent. Each browser is different, so check the help menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. Your device operating system may contain additional cookie controls. Note that some Services are designed to work using cookies, so disabling cookies may affect your ability to use those Services or certain parts of them.
    
      
    
    **Other Local Storage**
    
    We, along with certain third parties, may use other kinds of local storage technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as Flash cookies) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with our Services. These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above. They’re stored on your devices and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. However, these technologies may make use of different parts of your devices from standard cookies, so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings. For information about disabling or deleting information contained in Local Shared Objects, visit [http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html](http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html).
    
    **Beacons**
    
    We, along with certain third parties, may use technologies called beacons or pixels that communicate information from your device to a server. Beacons can be embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you’ve viewed particular content or a particular email message, and determine the time and date on which you viewed the beacon and the IP address of your device. We and certain third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes, including to analyze the use of our Services and, along with cookies, to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.

    **WHAT THIRD PARTY SERVICES DO WE USE?**
    
    Some of the additional services such as online payments and credit services, content, advertising, and functionality in our services are provided by third parties. These third parties may also use cookies, beacons, tracking pixels, and other tools to collect information about your use of their and/or our services. These third parties are not controlled directly by Samsung, so we recommend that you check their privacy policies and/or terms and conditions to understand how they use your data and provide services.
    
    For some apps and services, including social networks, we receive and store sign-in information, as well as other information that you allow us to receive when you connect with these apps and services.
    
    **COOKIES, BEACONS, AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES**
    
    We, as well as certain third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on our Services, use cookies, pixels, beacons, and other technologies in certain areas of our services, as explained in more detail below.
    
    Cookies
    
    Cookies are small files that store information on your computer, TV, mobile phone, or other device. They enable the entity that put the cookie on your device to recognise you across different websites, services, devices, and/or browsing sessions. Cookies serve many useful purposes. For example:
    
    *   Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you don’t have to enter those credentials each time you log on to a service.
    *   Cookies help us and third parties understand which parts of our services are the most popular because they help us to see which pages and features visitors are accessing and how much time they are spending on the pages. By studying this kind of information, we are better able to adapt the services and provide you with a better experience.
    *   Cookies help us and third parties understand which ads you have seen so that you don’t receive the same ad each time you access a service.
    *   Cookies help us and third parties provide you with relevant content and advertising by collecting information about your use of our services and other websites and apps.
    When you use a web browser to access the services, you can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent. Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. The operating system of your device may contain additional controls for cookies. Please note, however, that some services may be designed to work using cookies and that disabling cookies may affect your ability to use those services, or certain parts of them. We use the following types of cookies on our website:
    
    Essential Cookies
    
    These enable you to order products and receive services from our website;
    
    Performance Cookies
    
    Theses enable us to analyse the performance and design of our website and detect errors. For example, this type of cookie allows us to recognise that you have visited our website before and shows which sections of our website are most popular by allowing us to see which pages visitors access most frequently and how much time visitors spend on each page. We use, without limitation, Google Analytics, Adobe, and similar analytics cookies to achieve this. For example, the information generated by the cookie about the use of the website will normally be stored on a Google server in the United States. However, if you are located within the EU or the European Economic Area, your IP address will be shortened by Google beforehand. In exceptional cases only, your full address will be transmitted to a Google server in the United States and shortened there. On our behalf, Google will use this information for the purpose of compiling reports on website activity and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. The IP address transmitted from your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be associated with any other data held by Google. You may prevent web usage data (including your IP address) generated by the cookie from being transmitted to Google and processed there if you download and install this Browser-Plugin ([http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en)).
    
    Functional Cookies
    
    which allow us to deliver a better user experience. For example, this type of cookie ensures that the information displayed on your next visit to our website will match up with your user preferences, or your Samsung account from which you linked to our website, or the fact that you linked to our website via an email sent to you by Samsung or one of our trusted third party service providers contacting you on our behalf.
    
    Advertising Cookies
    
    which enables us and our carefully selected partners to deliver advertisements to you, or contact you directly where you have separately consented to such communications, which match your interests by, for example, collecting information about products you have browsed or ordered on our website. For example, and without limitation, we use Google remarketing tags to allow our retail partners to advertise products which you have browsed on our website. For further information about how Google remarketing tags work, please click here: [http://www.google.co.uk/think/products/newremarketing-tag.html](http://www.google.co.uk/think/products/newremarketing-tag.html). Our website may also display content from a third party website or service, which may result in cookies from third parties being stored on your hard drive or browser. We do not control the storage of these cookies and you should refer to the privacy policies of the relevant third party for more information.
    
    Other Local Storage
    
    We, along with certain third parties, may use other kinds of local storage technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as “Flash cookies”) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with our services. These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your device and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. However, these technologies may make use of different parts of your device from standard cookies, and so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings. For information about disabling or deleting information contained in Flash cookies, please click here [http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html](http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html).
    
    Beacons and/or Pixels
    
    We, along with certain third parties, may also use technologies called beacons or pixels that communicate information from your device to a server. Beacons and pixels can be embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message, determine the time and date on which you viewed the beacon and pixels, and the IP address of your device. We and certain third parties use beacons and pixels for a variety of purposes, including to analyse the use of our Services and (in conjunction with cookies) to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.
    
    When you access and use our Services (except for websites provided by third party service providers), you will be asked to provide your separate consent to the storage of cookies (which includes other local storage technologies, beacons, pixels and other information on your devices) by us. You will also be asked to provide your separate consent to the access of such cookies (which includes local storage technologies, beacons, pixels and information) by us and by the third parties mentioned above. Your experience of our website/services may be affected if you do not accept cookies, and further information will be provided to you at the time we ask you for this specific consent.

*   ### [SAMSUNG PRIVACY POLICY – SMART TV SUPPLEMENT](javascript:void(0))
    
    Samsung’s Smart TV service offers a set of features that provide enhanced video content, customized TV experiences, movies, connections to social networking services, and the ability to control and interact with your Smart TV with voice commands. We collect, use, share, and store information through your Smart TV and the devices connected with your Smart TV in the ways described in the Samsung Privacy Policy. This Supplement provides additional details about the privacy practices of some Smart TV features.
    
    The Smart TV is designed to enable you to easily find and access video programming and other content. For example, you may access information about live television programs distributed to you by your cable or satellite operator and on-demand video content offerings distributed by third party content providers through searchable guides displayed on your Smart TV.
    
    In the case of live television programs, we determine what content is available to you based in part on your postcode. Below, we provide information about additional services and features available on the Smart TV, namely: Viewing Information Services, Interest-Based Advertisements, and Voice Recognition. Further below, you will find the privacy notices related to each of these.
    
    _Viewing Information Services_
    
    In order to provide you with customized content on your Smart TV and highlight programming that is likely to interest you, Samsung may rely on your TV viewing history and Smart TV usage information to provide Viewing Information Services. This is an optional service that you may choose to activate to receive content and recommendations that are customized to your interests and entertainment preferences. If you choose not to activate this service, or to subsequently deactivate it, then you will receive generic content that is not customized to your specific interests or preferences and is based on your Smart TV usage information only. Smart TV usage information includes information about frequently launched apps, and the start and end time for launching and using apps.
    
    If you have activated Viewing Information Services, we base content and programming recommendations and additional services on:
    
    *   Information about content that you have watched, purchased, downloaded, or streamed through Samsung applications on your Smart TV or other devices;
    *   Information about applications you have accessed through the Smart TV;
    *   Information about your clicks on the “Like”, “Dislike”, “Watch Now”, and other buttons on your Smart TV;
    *   The query terms you enter into Smart TV search features, including when you search for particular video content;
    *   Other Smart TV device information, including, but not limited to, IP address, log data, information that identifies your hardware or software configuration, browser information, and the page(s) you request.
    
    For more detailed information about the Viewing Information Services, please refer to the Viewing Information Services Privacy Notice at the end of this Supplement.
    
    _Interest-Based Advertisements_
    
    Interest-Based Advertisements are designed to provide users with useful, interactive, and relevant advertisements about products and services offered by Samsung and third parties on your Samsung Smart TV or across various Samsung and third party platforms or devices, including linear commercials, on the web, mobile devices, and tablets.
    
    In order to make the advertisements on your devices more relevant to you, we may (in accordance with applicable law) rely on your TV viewing history (including information about the networks, channels, websites visited, and programs viewed on your Samsung Smart TV and the amount of time spent viewing them), Samsung Smart TV usage information, and other statistical data obtained from trusted third party data sources. We may use automatic content recognition (ACR) and other technologies to capture your TV viewing history.
    
    Based on the information above we create groups of Samsung Smart TV owners who share similar interests and use these categories of user groups for Interest-Based Advertisements. The information above is used to determine the groups to which your Samsung Smart TV is assigned and as a result, which advertisements your Smart TV and other connected devices receive.
    
    Interest-Based Advertisements is an optional feature, and you may choose to enable or disable it at any time by visiting the Settings menu on your Samsung Smart TV.
    
    Please note that your privacy choice with respect to the IBA Service will not affect whether or not you receive or are served with other types of ads and marketing that are not specifically based on TV viewing history or Samsung Smart TV usage information. Those other types of ads and marketing will be based on other information such as generalized location and other estimated or inferred information (e.g., IP address, and estimated TV size based on Model ID). Samsung processes this limited data – together with the Personalized Service ID (“PSID”) and Tizen ID for Advertising (“TIFA”) associated with your Smart TV – on the basis of its legitimate interest to serve generalized advertisements. These generalized advertisements might be less relevant because they are not based on your interests.
    
    For more detailed information about Interest-Based Advertisements, please refer to the Interest-Based Advertisements Privacy Notice at the end of this Supplement.
    
    _Voice Recognition_
    
    You can control your Smart TV, and use many of its features, with voice commands.
    
    If you enable Voice Recognition, you can interact with your Smart TV using your voice. To provide the Voice Recognition feature, your voice commands will be transmitted (along with information about your device, including device identifiers) to us and we will convert your voice commands into text to provide the Voice Recognition features. In addition, Samsung may collect voice commands and associated texts so that we can evaluate and improve the features. Samsung will collect your voice commands when you make a specific request to the Smart TV by clicking the activation button either on the remote control or on your screen or by speaking a wake word (e.g. “Hi, Bixby”) and speaking into the microphone on the remote control or Smart TV.
    
    If you do not enable Voice Recognition, you will not be able to use the voice recognition features.
    
    You may disable Voice Recognition data collection at any time by visiting the Settings menu. However, this would prevent you from using the Voice Recognition features.
    
    For more detailed information about the Voice Recognition, please refer to the Voice Recognition Privacy Notice at the end of this Supplement.
    
    _Third Parties_
    
    Please note that when you watch a video or access applications or content provided by a third party, that provider may collect or receive information about your Smart TV (e.g. its IP address and device identifiers), the requested transaction (e.g. your request to buy or rent the video), and your use of the application or service. Samsung is not responsible for these providers’ privacy or security practices. You should exercise caution and review the privacy statements applicable to the third party websites and services you use.
    
    _Country-Specific Features_
    
    Please note that one or more of the features described in this Smart TV Supplement may not be available to you depending on where you live.
    
*   ### [VIEWING INFORMATION SERVICES PRIVACY NOTICE](javascript:void(0))
    
    _Effective Date: 26th October, 2020_
    
    Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and its affiliated companies (collectively “Samsung”) respect your concerns about privacy. This Privacy Notice applies to the personal information we may collect and use to provide customized content your Smart TV.
    
    This Privacy Notice provides information about how Samsung collects, uses and shares your personal information in connection with Viewing Information Services. Our Privacy Policy at https://account.samsung.com/membership/pp (“Samsung Privacy Policy”) will also apply to your use of Viewing Information Services, and should be read in conjunction with this Privacy Notice.
    
    **WHAT ARE VIEWING INFORMATION SERVICES?**
    
    In order to provide you with customized content on your Smart TV, Samsung may rely on your TV viewing history and Smart TV usage information. Smart TV usage information includes information about frequently launched apps, and the start and end time for launching and using apps. Viewing Information Services is an optional service that you may choose to activate to receive content that is customized to your interests and entertainment preferences. If you choose not to activate this service, or to subsequently deactivate it, then you will receive generic content that is not customized to your specific interests or preferences and is based on your Smart TV usage information only.
    
    **WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?**
    
    We collect your TV viewing history, together with TV device identifiers (including Personalized Service ID or “PSID”) and IP address. Your TV viewing history includes information about:
    
    *   the networks, channels, websites visited and programs viewed on your Smart TV; and
    *   the amount of time spent viewing them.
    
    We may use automatic content recognition (ACR) and other technologies to capture this information. We collect this information when your Smart TV transfers video snippets or TV tuner information to our servers in order to determine the programs watched. When you consent to Viewing Information Services, then ACR will allow our Smart TVs to generate a unique video signature of TV frames in order to determine whether the video signature is from a TV program, Video-On-Demand titles, linear TV ads or video games. ACR does not identify content played through Samsung Smart TV apps.
    
    **HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?**
    
    We use the information described above to provide you customized content recommendations on your Smart TV, based on your interests and entertainment preferences.
    
    Samsung processes personal information for Viewing Information Services on the basis of your consent, which you may provide by affirmatively ticking the checkbox associated with this Privacy Notice. You may subsequently withdraw your consent at any time by visiting the Settings menu (or by accessing the Privacy Choices app, if this is available on your Smart TV), in which case your TV viewing history will cease to be processed for that particular feature or purpose.
    
    **WHO DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH?**
    
    We will share your personal information internally within our business, and with other Samsung Electronics Group companies which we control and/or own, for the purpose of providing Viewing Information Services.
    
    **WHERE DO WE SEND YOUR DATA?**
    
    Your use of our Services will involve the transfer, storage, and processing of your personal information within and outside of your country of residence, consistent with this policy. In particular, your personal information will be transferred to the Republic of Korea. Please note that the data protection and other laws of countries to which your information may be transferred might not be as comprehensive as those in your country.
    
    \[For European Economic Area (EEA) Residents Only\]
    
    In addition, your use of the Services may also involve the transfer, storage, and processing of your personal information to other countries; such countries include, without limitation, countries in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, the United States of America, Canada, and India. We will take appropriate measures, in compliance with applicable law, to ensure that your personal information remains protected. Such measures include the use of Standard Contractual Clauses to safeguard the transfer of data outside of the EEA. To request more information or to obtain a copy of the contractual agreements in place, contact us. See the [CONTACT US](#privacy-ctns-eleven) section.

*   ### [INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISEMENTS PRIVACY NOTICE](javascript:void(0))
    
    _Effective Date: 26th October, 2020_
    
    Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd (‘Samsung’) and its affiliated companies respect your concerns about privacy. This Privacy Notice applies to the personal information we collect and use to display interest-based advertisements on your Smart TV and other connected devices.
    
    This Privacy Notice should be read in conjunction with the Samsung Privacy Policy, which applies to your general use of the Samsung Smart TV and can be found at [https://account.samsung.com/membership/pp](https://account.samsung.com/membership/pp).
    
    In this Privacy Notice, we describe the types of personal information used for interest-based advertisements, how we use that information, and the choices available to you regarding our use of the information and exercising your rights. Samsung is the data controller for the processing of personal information to display interest-based advertisements as described in this Privacy Notice.
    
    **WHAT ARE INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISEMENTS?**
    
    Interest-based advertisements are designed to provide users with useful, interactive, and relevant advertisements about products and services offered by Samsung and third parties on your Samsung Smart TV or across various Samsung and third-party platforms or devices, including linear commercials, on the web, mobile devices, and tablets.
    
    In order to make the advertisements on your devices more relevant to you, we may—with your consent—analyze your TV viewing history (including information about the networks, channels, websites visited, and programs viewed on your Samsung Smart TV and the amount of time spent viewing them), Samsung Smart TV usage information, and other statistical data obtained from trusted third-party data sources. We may use automatic content recognition (“ACR”) and other technologies to capture and analyze your TV viewing history when you enable Viewing Information Services on your Samsung Smart TV. For more information on the Viewing Information Services feature, please select “Read More” in the where it appears beside the Viewing Information Services tick box.
    
    Based on the information above, we create groups of Samsung Smart TV users who share similar interests and use these categories of user groups for interest-based advertisements. The information above is used to determine the groups to which your Samsung Smart TV is assigned and as a result, which advertisements your Smart TV and other connected devices receive.
    
    Please note that some third parties may display interest-based advertisements in their apps on your Samsung Smart TV. These third parties are responsible for their own data practices, for example to have a valid legal basis to process your personal data. If you want to know how these third parties process your personal data, please review the privacy policies for their platforms and apps.
    
    To further protect your privacy, Samsung also provides you with additional options to exercise control over interest-based advertisements on third parties’ apps. For example, third parties are disallowed from processing your data to display interest-based advertisements in their apps unless they have both a valid legal basis for it on their own app and you have also opted in to interest-based advertisements on the Samsung Smart TV. If you would like to learn more about these options, please see the [PSID AND TIFA](#psid-and-tifa) and [YOUR CHOICES](#your-choices) sections below or visit www.samsungtifa.com for more information.
    
    **WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?**
    
    To provide you with interest-based advertisements, we may obtain the following information about your devices, which may include personal information:
    
    *   Device Information. We collect information such as your device model, operating system versions, device configurations and settings, IP address, and device identifiers (including the Personalized Service ID (“PSID”) and Tizen ID For Advertising (“TIFA”), which are unique, randomized, and user-resettable identifiers associated with your Smart TV, as described further below).
    *   Device Usage and Log Information. We collect information about how, when, and for how long you use your devices, including your interactions with interest-based advertisements and Samsung and third-party apps and services on the devices (such as a listing of apps on your devices).
    *   TV Viewing Information. We collect your TV viewing history. Your TV viewing history includes information about the networks, channels, websites visited, and programs viewed on your Samsung Smart TV and the amount of time spent viewing them. We may use ACR and other technologies to capture and analyze this TV viewing history when you enable the Viewing Information Services on your Samsung Smart TV (as described in the Viewing Information Services privacy notice).
    *   Statistical Information. We may use statistical information about you or your devices such as generalized location and estimated age group. We obtain this statistical information from commercially available sources (as permitted by law) such as our third-party service providers. We only work with third-party service providers who ensure that this information has been obtained in accordance with applicable law and can be provided to us for use and disclosure.
    
    _PSID AND TIFA_
    
    Information about your device usage that is collected for the purposes of providing interest-based advertisements will be linked to a randomized, non-persistent, and resettable device identifier called the PSID. We will use the PSID for the display of advertisements to Samsung Smart TV users. You may reset your PSID as specified in the [YOUR CHOICES](#your-choices) section of this Privacy Notice.
    
    In order to protect your personal information and your preferences, third parties intending to provide advertisements in their apps will do so by collecting and using the TIFA associated with your Samsung Smart TV. The TIFA is a randomized version of your device's PSID, and this randomization ensures that such third parties do not know that it is your specific device to which advertisements are sent. Please visit www.samsungtifa.com if you would like to learn more about interest-based advertisements offered by third parties.
    
    **HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?**
    
    We use the information described above to:
    
    *   display (and allow advertisers to display) interest-based advertising on your Smart TV and other connected devices; and
    *   improve and customize your experience with interest-based advertisements.
    
    Samsung processes personal information for interest-based advertisements on the basis of your consent, which you may provide by affirmatively selecting the tick box associated with this privacy notice. You may subsequently withdraw your consent at any time by accessing the Privacy Choices App or in the Settings on the Smart TV without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
    
    **WHO DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH?**
    
    We may share your information:
    
    *   internally, with other Samsung Electronics Group companies, for example, AdGear Technologies Inc. which we control and/or own, for the purpose of providing interest-based advertisements to you;
    *   with our service providers, who assist us in providing interest-based advertising; and
    *   externally, we may share certain information – such as IP address, TIFA, ad placement information (e.g., screen resolution), and consent opt-in/out status – with ad platforms, and other advertising partners to enable them to provide interest-based advertisements (if you have opted in) or generalized advertisements (if you have opted out).
    
    **WHERE DO WE SEND YOUR DATA?**
    
    Your use of our Services will involve the transfer, storage, and processing of your personal information within and outside of your country of residence, consistent with this policy. In particular, your personal information will be transferred to the Republic of Korea. Please note that the data protection and other laws of countries to which your information may be transferred might not be as comprehensive as those in your country.
    
    \[For European Economic Area (EEA) Residents Only
    
    In addition, your use of the Services may also involve the transfer, storage, and processing of your personal information to other countries; such countries include, without limitation, countries in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, the United States of America, Canada, and India. We will take appropriate measures, in compliance with applicable law, to ensure that your personal information remains protected. Such measures include the use of Standard Contractual Clauses to safeguard the transfer of data outside of the EEA. To request more information or to obtain a copy of the contractual agreements in place, contact us. See the [CONTACT US](#privacy-ctns-eleven) section.
    
    **YOUR CHOICES**
    
    We offer you certain choices in connection with your personal information collected and used by us and/or third parties for purposes of interest-based advertisements.
    
    You may reset your [PSID AND TIFA](#psid-and-tifa) at any time by selecting “Reset PSID” on the settings menu, and once reset, your TV viewing history and Smart TV usage information will not be linked to the its previous PSID (or TIFA). Bear in mind that if you reset your PSID, the quality of interest-based advertisements will be affected.
    
    In addition, you may disable interest-based advertisements at any time by accessing the Privacy Choices app or the Settings menu on the Smart TV
    
    If you withdraw from interest-based advertisements, you will no longer receive interest-based advertisements provided by us and the third parties. Please note, however, that your privacy choice with respect to interest-based advertisements will not affect whether or not you receive or are served with other types of ads and marketing that are not specifically based on TV viewing history or Samsung Smart TV usage information. Those other types of ads and marketing will be based on other information such as generalized location and other estimated or inferred information (e.g., estimated TV size based on Model ID). They might be less relevant because they are not based on your interests. Samsung processes this limited personal data to serve generalized advertisements on the Smart TV that are not based on users’ viewing behavior or other specific interests.
