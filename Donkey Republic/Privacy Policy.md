If you like to rent a bike, ebike, etc. (“Vehicle”) or becoming a member, you will need to provide personal data (e.g. name, email address, mobile number, payment method, credit card number etc.) in order to conclude the contract. In addition, we need this personal information in order to process your order. The legal basis for this is Article 6 (1) (1) point (b) of the GDPR. We store these data as long as you are our customer with an active account. Your account is regarded inactive, if you have not made use of the account for 36 consecutive months, after which point in time the order data will be erased, if we are not obliged to retain the data as described below. 
2.  Under the provisions of the applicable commercial and tax laws, we are obliged to retain your order data for the legally prescribed period. The legal basis for this is Article 6 (1) (1) point (c) of the GDPR. At the end of the statutory retention periods stipulated by the commercial and tax laws, we shall erase your order data.

If you make use of this right to object, we shall no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms or unless the processing is for purposes of asserting, exercising or defending legal claims.
2.  Where we process your personal data for direct advertising purposes, you will have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data for such advertising purposes; this also includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct advertising. The existence of a special situation, as in (a), is therefore, not necessary for an effective objection to direct advertising. If you object to processing for direct advertising purposes, your personal data will no longer be processed for such purposes.
