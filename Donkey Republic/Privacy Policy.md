In addition, we need this personal information in order to process your order. The legal basis for this is Article 6 (1) point (b) of the GDPR. We store these data as long as you are our customer with an active account. Your account is regarded inactive, if you have not made use of the account for 48 consecutive months, after which point in time the order data will be erased, if we are not obliged to retain the data as described below.
