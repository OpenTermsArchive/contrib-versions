Flickr Community guidelines  
  
**Flickr accounts are intended for members to share original photos and video that they themselves have created.**  
  
These Community Guidelines are here to help you understand what it means to be a member of Flickr. Don't forget that your use of Flickr is subject to these Community Guidelines and the Flickr Terms &. Conditions of Use.  
  
Things to do  

> Play nice  
>   
> We're a global community of many types of people, who all have the right to feel comfortable and who may not think what you think, believe what you believe, or see what you see. So, be polite and respectful in your interactions with other members.  
>   
> Only upload content that you have created.  
>   
> Respect the copyright of others. This means don't steal photos or videos that other people have shared and pass them off as your own. (That's what favorites and galleries are for.)  
>   
> Moderate your content.  
>   
> All content on Flickr, public and private, has to be appropriately moderated as "safe", "moderate", or "restricted" using our safety and content filters. If your judgment proves to be poor, we'll moderate your account to match appropriate categorization for Safe Search and/or content type and send you a warning.  
>   
> Link back to Flickr when you post your Flickr content elsewhere.  
>   
> Flickr makes it possible to post content hosted on Flickr to other web sites. Pages on other web sites that display content hosted on flickr.com must provide a link from each photo or video back to its page on Flickr. This provides a way to get more information about the content and the photographer.  
>   
> Enjoy Flickr!  
>   
> This is your community. Celebrate your creativity, be social and share what's important to you. See the world through others' eyes, participate, find your muse, and expand your horizons!

  
Things not to do

> Here's the deal: We like to give second chances. However, when we discover you stepping across any of the lines listed below, we will take action, which may mean deleting your account with or without warning.  
>   
>   
> Don't upload anything that isn't yours.  
>   
> This includes other people's photos, video, and/or stuff you've copied or collected from around the Internet. Accounts that consist primarily of such collections may be deleted at any time. Flickr also has a zero tolerance policy towards sharing adult or sexualized content of another person without that person’s consent (Non-Consensual Pornography). If you experience this, report it to us.  
>   
> Don't forget the children.  
>   
> If you would hesitate to show your photos or videos to a child, your family, or a stranger on the street, that means you need to set the appropriate content filter setting. If you don't, your account will be moderated and possibly deleted by Flickr staff.  
>   
> Don't show nudity in your buddy icon or cover photo.  
>   
> Only content considered "safe" is appropriate for your icon or cover photo. If we find either contains inappropriate content, we'll remove it, mark your account as "restricted" and send you a warning. If we find you doing it again, we'll delete your account.  
>   
> Don't upload content that is illegal or prohibited.  
>   
> If we find you doing that, your account will be deleted and we'll take appropriate action, which may include reporting you to the authorities. Don't vent your frustrations, rant, or bore the brains out of other members. Flickr is not a venue for you to harass, abuse, spam, impersonate, or intimidate others. If we receive a valid complaint about your conduct, we'll send you a warning or delete your account.  
>   
> Don't be creepy.  
>   
> You know the guy. Don't be that guy.  
>   
> Don't use your account to host web graphics or as a replacement for a content distribution network.  
>   
> If we find you using your account to host generic graphic elements of web page designs, logos, banners, icons, and other non-photographic elements on other web sites, or if you show suspicious upload behavior that impacts the stability of our servers, we will warn you or delete your account.  
>   
> Don’t spam  
>   
> We don't tolerate spam, deceptive tagging, deceptive photo titles and descriptions, resource abuse, or other abusive means to generate revenue and traffic to your photos on Flickr or elsewhere.  
>   
> Don't use Flickr for unauthorized commercial activity.  
>   
> If you are a photographer and you are specifically promoting your own work, you can use your Flickr account to link to other sites where you share or sell your work. If you have a free account and don’t have a Flickr Pro account, you may not link directly to a shopping cart, checkout page, or pricing pages on other sites, and you may not list prices on your Flickr photo descriptions.

  
  
If you are a Flickr Pro member, you can use Flickr to promote your photography business, your products, your photography classes, etc. You can link directly to a shopping cart, checkout page, or pricing pages on other sites, and you can list prices for your images in your Flickr photo descriptions. As long as you are promoting your own photography and you aren’t violating the Flickr Terms &. Conditions of Use, you are good with us.  
  
Your links need to be human readable (no shortened URLs) and they should be relevant to the photo, such as links to your website, to social media sites, or to your blog. Don’t turn your photo descriptions into link spam.  
  
Some examples of acceptable use of Flickr if you are a Pro:

> If you are a wedding photographer, you can share albums with your clients and use Flickr to promote your work.  
>   
> If you make photo books through Blurb or other companies and want to promote them on Flickr, that’s ok.  
>   
> If you teach photography classes and you want to promote those classes, that’s fine with us.  
>   
> If you make and sell products (e.g. cookbooks, origami, custom bricks, craftwork, jewelry, digital products, etc), so long as you are a Flickr Pro member, you can promote them on Flickr.

Regardless of whether you have a free account or a Flickr Pro account, your links need to be human readable (no shortened URLs) and they should be relevant to the photo, such as links to your website, to social media sites, or to your blog. Don’t turn your photo descriptions into link spam.  
  
Oh, and one more thing:  
  
Copyright Infringement.  
  
If you see photos or videos that you've created in another member's photostream, don't panic. This is probably just a misunderstanding and not malicious. A good first step is to contact them via FlickrMail and politely ask them to remove it. If that doesn't work, please file a Notice with Flickr's Designated Copyright Agent referenced in the Flickr Terms &. Conditions of Use who will take it from there.  
  
You may be tempted to post an entry on your photostream or in our public forum about what's happening, but that's not the best way to resolve a possible copyright problem. We don't encourage singling out individuals like this on Flickr as it could be seen as harassment which is against our guidelines.  
  
In Conclusion  
  
If you don't feel that you can abide by our Community Guidelines as outlined above, maybe Flickr isn't for you. We've crafted these guidelines to ensure that everyone within the Flickr community has a good time.
