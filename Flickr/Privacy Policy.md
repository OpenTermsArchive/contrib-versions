Flickr Flickr is a photo sharing community which provides you with an easy way to post and share photos online and add meaningful metadata and comments to photos.

Account Information

*   In Profile Privacy, you can control who is able to see different parts of your profile, including email address, IM names, real name, and current city.
*   In your Account Settings, you may also hide photos or your profile from searches on flickr.com as well as from searches on 3rd party sites that use the Yahoo! API, including Yahoo! Image Search.

Information Collection and Use Practices

*   In your Privacy Settings, you can choose to make your photos default to public for anyone to access, restrict access to a limited number of other Flickr users, or keep those photos private so only you can access them. On each photo page, you will also find more granular controls to change each photo setting.
*   Advertisements shown to you may be related to textual information, such as metadata and notes, associated with the photo you are seeing, or the search term you entered.

Location Information and Sharing

*   When you upload a photo with geographical data (i.e. from a mobile device) or manually geotag your photo, the photo's location can be shown on a map.
*   You can also set your geopreferences to decide who can see the location of your photos by default. Further, you can change the geopreferences setting on individual photos by clicking on the map to the right of each photo.  
      
    EXIF Data
    
    *   o You may elect to hide a link showing EXIF data about photos or video you upload. The link, where applicable, shows on all your individual photo pages, and displays the make &. model of the camera you used to take the shot. Unless you turn off EXIF data on your camera or device or remove it from the picture before uploading to Flickr, Flickr receives and stores EXIF data, but will not display that information if hidden.
    *   Some cameras can store GPS (location) coordinates in a photo's EXIF header. If you like, you Flickr can import that data and use it to place your photos on your map automatically.
    
    Geofences
    *   A geofence is a hotspot on a map that has special default geo privacy settings. These are useful for locations such as "home" or "school" that you would like to make more private than your global default. Click here to create your geofences.

**Image recognition**

*   We use image recognition algorithms to identify scenes, actions, or objects to autotag your photos and make it easier to search images.
*   You may hide your images from appearing in search results.
