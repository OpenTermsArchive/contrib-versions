---------------------------------------

4.1 **Independent Controllers**. Subject to Section 4.3 (End Controllers), each party:

(a) is an independent controller of Controller Personal Data under the European Data Protection Legislation;

(b) will individually determine the purposes and means of its processing of Controller Personal Data; and

Each party will ensure that its End Controllers comply with the Controller Terms, including (where applicable) the Controller SCCs.

5. Data Transfers
-----------------

5.1 **Restricted European Transfers**. Either party may make Restricted European Transfers if it complies with the provisions on Restricted European Transfers in the European Data Protection Legislation.

5.2 **Alternative Transfer Solution**.

(a) If Google announces its adoption of an Alternative Transfer Solution for any Restricted European Transfers, then: (i) Google will ensure that such Restricted European Transfers are made in accordance with that Alternative Transfer Solution; and (ii) Section 6 (Controller SCCs) will not apply to such Restricted European Transfers.

(b) If Google has not adopted, or has informed Customer that Google is no longer adopting, an Alternative Transfer Solution for any Restricted European Transfers, then Section 6 (Controller SCCs) will apply to such Restricted European Transfers.

6. Controller SCCs
------------------

6.1 **Transfers of European Controller Personal Data to Customer**. To the extent that:

(a) Google transfers European Controller Personal Data to Customer; and

(b) the transfer is a Restricted European Transfer,

Customer as data importer will be deemed to have entered into the Controller SCCs with Google Ireland Limited (the applicable Google End Controller) as data exporter and the transfers will be subject to the Controller SCCs.

6.2 **Transfers of UK Controller Personal Data to Customer**. To the extent that:

(a) Google transfers UK Controller Personal Data to Customer; and

(b) the transfer is a Restricted European Transfer,

Customer as data importer will be deemed to have entered into the Controller SCCs with Google LLC (the applicable Google End Controller) as data exporter and the transfers will be subject to the Controller SCCs.

6.3 **Transfers of European Controller Personal Data to Google**. The parties acknowledge that to the extent Customer transfers European Controller Personal Data to Google, the Controller SCCs are not required because the address of Google Ireland Limited (the applicable Google End Controller) is in an Adequate Country and such transfers are Permitted European Transfers. This does not affect Google’s obligations under Section 5.1 (Restricted European Transfers).

6.4 **Transfers of UK Controller Personal Data to Google**. To the extent that Customer transfers UK Controller Personal Data to Google, Customer as data exporter will be deemed to have entered into the Controller SCCs with Google LLC (the applicable Google End Controller) as data importer and the transfers will be subject to the Controller SCCs, because Google LLC’s address is not in an Adequate Country.

6.5 **Contacting Google; Customer Information**.

(a) Customer may contact Google Ireland Limited and/or Google LLC in connection with the Controller SCCs at [https://support.google.com/policies/troubleshooter/9009584](https://support.google.com/policies/troubleshooter/9009584) or through such other means as may be provided by Google from time to time.

(b) Customer acknowledges that Google is required under the Controller SCCs to record certain information, including (i) the identity and contact details of the data importer (including any contact person with responsibility for data protection); and (ii) the technical and organisational measures implemented by the data importer. Accordingly, Customer will, where requested and as applicable to Customer, provide such information to Google via such means as may be provided by Google, and will ensure that all information provided is kept accurate and up-to-date.

6.6 **Responding to Data Subject Enquiries**. The applicable data importer will be responsible for responding to enquiries from data subjects and the supervisory authority concerning the processing of applicable Controller Personal Data by the data importer.

6.7 **Data Deletion on Termination**. To the extent that:

(a) Google LLC acts as data importer and Customer acts as data exporter under the Controller SCCs; and

(b) Customer terminates the Agreement in accordance with Clause 16(c) of the Controller SCCs, then for the purposes of Clause 16(d) of the Controller SCCs, Customer directs Google to delete Controller Personal Data, and, unless European Laws require storage, Google will facilitate such deletion as soon as is reasonably practicable, to the extent such deletion is reasonably possible (taking into account that Google is an independent controller of such data, as well as the nature and functionality of the Controller Services).

7. Liability
------------

7.1 **Liability Cap**. If the Agreement is governed by the laws of:

(a) a state of the United States of America, then, regardless of anything else in the Agreement, the total liability of either party towards the other party under or in connection with these Controller Terms will be limited to the maximum monetary or payment-based amount at which that party’s liability is capped under the Agreement (and therefore, any exclusion of indemnification claims from the Agreement’s limitation of liability will not apply to indemnification claims under the Agreement relating to the European Data Protection Legislation or the Non-European Data Protection Legislation); or

(b) a jurisdiction that is not a state of the United States of America, then the liability of the parties under or in connection with these Controller Terms will be subject to the exclusions and limitations of liability in the Agreement.

7.2 **Liability if Controller SCCs Apply**. If Controller SCCs apply under Section 6 (Controller SCCs), then the total combined liability of:

(a) Google, Google LLC and Google Ireland Limited towards Customer; and

(b) Customer towards Google, Google LLC and Google Ireland Limited,

under or in connection with the Agreement and the Controller SCCs combined will be subject to Section 7.1 (Liability Cap). Clause 12 of the Controller SCCs will not affect the previous sentence.

8. Third-Party Beneficiaries
----------------------------

Where Google LLC and/or Google Ireland Limited are not a party to the Agreement but are a party to the applicable Controller SCCs in accordance with Section 6 (Controller SCCs), Google LLC and/or Google Ireland Limited (as applicable) will be a third-party beneficiary of Sections 4.3 (End Controllers), 6 (Controller SCCs), and 7.2 (Liability if Controller SCCs Apply). To the extent this Section 8 (Third-Party Beneficiaries) conflicts or is inconsistent with any other clause in the Agreement, this Section 8 (Third-Party Beneficiaries) will apply.

9. Effect of Controller Terms
-----------------------------

9.1 **Order of Precedence**. If there is any conflict or inconsistency between the applicable Controller SCCs, the Additional Terms for Non-European Data Protection Legislation, the remainder of these Controller Terms and/or the remainder of the Agreement then, subject to Sections 4.2 (Restrictions on Processing) and 9.4 (No Effect on Processor Terms), the following order of precedence will apply:

(a) the Controller SCCs (if applicable);

(b) the Additional Terms for Non-European Data Protection Legislation (if applicable);

(c) the remainder of these Controller Terms; and

(d) the remainder of the Agreement.

9.2 **Additional Commercial Clauses**. Subject to the amendments in these Controller Terms, the Agreement remains in full force and effect. Sections 6.5 (Contacting Google) to 6.7 (Data Deletion on Termination), and Section 7.2 (Liability if Controller SCCs Apply) are additional commercial clauses relating to the Controller SCCs as permitted by Clause 2(a) (Effect and invariability of the Clauses) of the Controller SCCs.

9.3 **No Modification of Controller SCCs**. Nothing in the Agreement (including these Controller Terms) is intended to modify or contradict any Controller SCCs or prejudice the fundamental rights or freedoms of data subjects under the European Data Protection Legislation.

9.4 **No Effect on Processor Terms**. These Controller Terms will not affect any separate terms between Google and Customer reflecting a controller-processor, processor-processor or processor-controller relationship for a service other than the Controller Services.

9.5 **Legacy UK SCCs**. As of 21 September 2022 or the Agreement’s effective date, whichever is later, the Controller SCCs’ supplementary terms for UK GDPR transfers will apply, and will supersede and terminate any standard contractual clauses approved under the UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018 and previously entered into by Customer and Google (“**Legacy UK SCCs**”). This Section 9.5 (Legacy UK SCCs) will not affect either party’s rights, or any data subject’s rights, that may have accrued under the Legacy UK SCCs while they were in force.

10. Changes to these Controller Terms
-------------------------------------

10.1 **Changes to Controller Services in Scope**. Google may only change the list of potential Controller Services at [business.safety.google/adsservices](https://privacy.google.com/businesses/adsservices/):

(b) is required to comply with applicable law, applicable regulation, a court order or guidance issued by a governmental regulator or agency, or reflects Google’s adoption of an Alternative Transfer Solution; or

(c) does not otherwise: (i) seek to alter the categorisation of the parties as controllers of Controller Personal Data under the European Data Protection Legislation; (ii) expand the scope of, or remove any restrictions on, either party’s rights to use or otherwise process (x) in the case of the Additional Terms for Non-European Data Protection Legislation, the data in scope of the Additional Terms for Non-European Data Protection Legislation or (y) in the case of the remainder of these Controller Terms, Controller Personal Data; or (iii) have a material adverse impact on Customer, as reasonably determined by Google.

10.3 **Notification of Changes**. If Google intends to change these Controller Terms under Section 10.2(b) and such change will have a material adverse impact on Customer, as reasonably determined by Google, then Google will use commercially reasonable efforts to inform Customer at least 30 days (or such shorter period as may be required to comply with applicable law, applicable regulation, a court order or guidance issued by a governmental regulator or agency) before the change will take effect.
