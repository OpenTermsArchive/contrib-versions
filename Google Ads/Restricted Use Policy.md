Google Ads policies
===================

Google provides translated versions of our Help Center, though they are not meant to change the content of our policies. The English version is the official language we use to enforce our policies. To view this article in a different language, use the language dropdown at the bottom of the page.

Display & Video 360 users must comply with this Google Ads policy. Visit the [Display & Video 360 help center](https://support.google.com/displayvideo/answer/6027406) for additional restrictions.

As part of our recent suspension of ads in Russia, we will also pause ads on Google properties and networks globally for advertisers based in Russia.

Due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, we will be temporarily pausing Google ads from serving to users located in Russia.

Overview of our policies and how we enforce them
------------------------------------------------

We strive to support a healthy digital advertising ecosystem—one that's trustworthy and transparent, and works for users, advertisers, and publishers. The purpose of this help center is to help you build Google Ads campaigns that align with our advertising policies listed below.

These policies are designed to ensure a safe and positive experience for our users and abide by applicable laws. This means that our policies prohibit content that is harmful to users and the overall advertising ecosystem.

Our advertising policies cover 4 broad areas:

> |     |     |
> | --- | --- |
> | ![Google Ads policies \| prohibited content](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/RrjdySjRxcYJL3NpcXaobwTxuk7zctDbL8rX) | **[Prohibited content](#con):** Content you can't advertise on the Google Network |
> | ![Google Ads policies \| prohibited practice](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/aYpRwkWqocXCGj8TVXwShJAbVpbcYO9qABIs) | **[Prohibited practices](#pra):** Things you can't do if you want to advertise with us |

> 
> Click through the policies below for policy definitions, examples, and troubleshooting steps.

We use a combination of Google AI and human evaluation to ensure that ads comply with these policies. Our enforcement technologies use Google AI, modeled on human reviewers’ decisions, to help protect our users and keep our ad platforms safe. More complex, nuanced or severe cases are often reviewed and evaluated by our specially-trained experts.

We take action on content that violates our policies. This may include disapproving violating ads so they don’t serve, as well as suspending accounts for repeat or egregious violations. We take repeat violations of our policies seriously and continue to expand a strike system for repeat offenders.

We will provide you with information on our decision for any policy violation enforcement actions we take. If one of your ads is disapproved, you can [fix that ad or appeal the decision](https://ads.google.com/aw/policymanager/issues) (or here for [DV360 ads](https://support.google.com/displayvideo/answer/12726387)). You can also [appeal an account suspension decision](https://ads.google.com/nav/login?dst=/aw/overview?supportResource%3Dsuspension_help) (or here for [DV360 appeals](https://support.google.com/displayvideo/contact/tns_dv360_account_suspension)). For these links to work, you’ll need to be signed into your Google Ads account.

> For that reason, we allow the promotion of the content below, but on a limited basis. These promotions may not show to every user in every location, and advertisers may need to meet additional requirements before their ads are eligible to run.
