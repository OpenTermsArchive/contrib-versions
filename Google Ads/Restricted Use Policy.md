Overview of our policies and how we enforce them
------------------------------------------------

We strive to support a healthy digital advertising ecosystem that's trustworthy and transparent for users, advertisers, and publishers. The purpose of this help center is to help you build Google Ads campaigns that align with our advertising policies listed below.

These policies are designed to ensure a safe and positive experience for our users and abide by applicable laws. This means that our policies prohibit content that is harmful to users and the overall advertising ecosystem.

Our advertising policies cover 4 broad areas:

> |     |     |
> | --- | --- |
> | ![Google Ads policies \| prohibited content](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/RrjdySjRxcYJL3NpcXaobwTxuk7zctDbL8rX) | **[Prohibited content](#con):** Content you can't advertise on the Google Network |
> | ![Google Ads policies \| prohibited practice](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/aYpRwkWqocXCGj8TVXwShJAbVpbcYO9qABIs) | **[Prohibited practices](#pra):** Things you can't do if you want to advertise with us |

> 
> To learn more about which policies are included in these broad categories, click the links for the category names to review the content below. For additional details about each policy, click the header of the section to learn more.

We use a combination of Google AI and human evaluation to ensure that ads comply with these policies. Our enforcement technologies use Google AI, modeled on human reviewers’ decisions, to help protect our users and keep our ad platforms safe. More complex, nuanced or severe cases are often reviewed and evaluated by our specially-trained experts.

We take action on content that violates our policies. This may include disapproving violating ads so they don’t serve, as well as suspending accounts for repeat or egregious violations. We take repeat violations of our policies seriously and continue to expand a strike system for repeat offenders.

We will provide you with information on our decision for any policy violation enforcement actions we take. If one of your ads is disapproved, you can [fix that ad or appeal the decision](https://ads.google.com/aw/policymanager/issues). You can also [appeal an account suspension decision](https://ads.google.com/nav/login?dst=/aw/overview?supportResource%3Dsuspension_help). For these links to work, you’ll need to be signed into your Google Ads account.

The policies below cover content that is sometimes legally or culturally sensitive. Online advertising can be a powerful way to reach customers, but in sensitive areas, we also work hard to avoid showing these ads when and where they might be inappropriate.

For that reason, we allow the promotion of the content below, but on a limited basis. These promotions may not show to every user in every location, and advertisers may need to meet additional requirements before their ads are eligible to run. Note that not all ad products, features, or networks are able to support this restricted content.

About our policies
------------------

Google Ads enables businesses of all sizes, from around the world, to promote a wide variety of products, services, applications, and websites on Google and across our network. We want to help you reach existing and potential customers and audiences. However, to help create a safe and positive experience for users, we listen to their feedback and concerns about the types of ads they see. We also regularly review changes in online trends and practices, industry norms, and regulations. And finally, in crafting our policies, we also think about our values and culture as a company, as well as operational, technical, and business considerations. As a result, we have created a set of policies that apply to all promotions on the Google Network.

Google requires that advertisers comply with all [applicable laws and regulations](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6023676) and the Google policies described above. It's important that you familiarize yourself with and keep up to date on these requirements for the places where your business operates, as well as any other places your ads are showing. When we find content that violates these requirements, we may block it from appearing, and in cases of repeated or egregious violations, we may stop you from advertising with us.

Advertisers have a responsibility not to promote content or engage in behavior that risks harm to our users, employees, or the Ads ecosystem. If we see such content or behavior, we may take action, including but not limited to restricting or blocking your ads or suspending your account.
