If you don’t agree with these new Terms, you are free to reject them. unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Service. If you use the Service in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes. Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.

The individual who accepts these terms and conditions, must be of a legal age to form a binding contract (or if not, you’ve received your parent’s or guardian’s permission to use the Service and gotten your parent or guardian to agree to these Terms on your behalf).

If you’re agreeing to these Terms on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on that organization or entity’s behalf and bind them to these Terms (in which case, the references to “you” and “your” in these Terms, except for in this sentence, refer to that organization or entity). You hereby certify you are legally permitted to use the Service, and take full responsibility for the selection, access, and use of the Service.

These Terms are void where prohibited by law, and the right to access and use the Service is revoked in such jurisdictions.

We are constantly trying to improve our Service, so these Terms may need to change along with the Service. We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice on ifttt.com website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means.

1\. The Service What are the basics of using the Service?

You may be required to sign up for an account, and select a password and user name (“IFTTT User ID”). As a condition to using the Service or in order to create certain statements through the Service, you may be required to supply IFTTT with certain registration information, including a valid email address, registration information for mobile phones, other mobile devices, or third-party sites or services you access through IFTTT.

You promise to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration information about yourself. You may not (i) select or use as your username a name of another person with the intent to impersonate that person. or (ii) use as your username a name subject to any rights of a person other than you without appropriate authorization. or (iii) use as your username a name that is otherwise offensive, vulgar or obscene. IFTTT reserves the right to refuse registration of, or cancel a username in its discretion. You shall not use another user's account or any other person's registration information for the Service, any other mobile phones or other mobile devices, or any third party services you access through the Service, without that person's permission.

Your right to use the Service continues until it is terminated by either party. You may terminate by discontinuing use of the Service. IFTTT may terminate at any time for any reason. Your use terminates automatically if (i) you violate any term of these Terms, (ii) IFTTT publicly posts a written notice of termination on the Service, (iii) IFTTT sends a written notice of termination to you, or (iv) IFTTT ceases providing access to the Service to you.

IFTTT will use reasonable efforts to ensure that the Service is available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. However, there will be occasions when the Service will be interrupted for maintenance, upgrades and emergency repairs. Every reasonable step will be taken by IFTTT to minimize such disruption where it is within IFTTT's reasonable control. You agree that IFTTT will not be liable in any event to you or any other party for any suspension, modification, discontinuance or lack of availability of the Service.

You shall be responsible for obtaining and maintaining any equipment or ancillary services needed to connect to, access or otherwise use the Service, including, without limitation, mobile phones, modems, hardware, software, data plans, and long distance or local telephone service. You shall be responsible for ensuring that such equipment or ancillary services are compatible with the Service.

What are my rights in the Service?

You promise to abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in any Content you access through the Service, and you won’t use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content not owned by you, (i) without the prior consent of the owner of that Content or (ii) in a way that violates someone else’s (including IFTTT’s) rights.

You understand that IFTTT owns the Service. You won’t (except as permitted by applicable law) reverse engineer, modify, or create derivative works based on the Service.

The Service may allow you to copy or download certain Content. please remember that just because this functionality exists, doesn’t mean that all the restrictions above don’t apply – they do!

What if I see something on the Service that infringes my copyright?

You may have heard of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”), as it relates to online service providers, like IFTTT, being asked to remove material that allegedly violates someone’s copyright. We respect others’ intellectual property rights, and we reserve the right to delete or disable Content alleged to be infringing, and to terminate the accounts of repeat alleged infringers. to review our complete Copyright Dispute Policy and learn how to report potentially infringing content, click here.

Who is responsible for what I see and do on the Service?

Any information or Content publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Service is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such information or Content originated, and you access all such information or Content at your own risk. We aren’t liable for any errors or omissions in that information or Content or for any damages or loss you might suffer in connection with it. We cannot control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the information or Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the information or Content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired information or Content through the Service. We can’t guarantee the identity of any users with whom you interact in using the Service and are not responsible for which users gain access to the Service.

You are responsible for all Content you contribute, in any manner, to the Service, and you represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it. You will keep all your registration information accurate and current. You are responsible for all your activity in connection with the Service.

The Service may contain links or connections to third party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by IFTTT. When you access third party websites or use third party services, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that IFTTT is not responsible for such risks. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Service and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party website or service that you visit or utilize.

IFTTT has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the Content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any third party websites or by any third party that you interact with through the Service. In addition, IFTTT will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the Content of any third party site or service. By using the Service, you release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any third party website or service.

Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Service, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties. You agree that IFTTT shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings.

If there is a dispute between participants on this site, or between users and any third party, you agree that IFTTT is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release IFTTT, its officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Service. If you are a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor."

Will IFTTT ever change the Service?

We’re always trying to improve the Service, so it may change over time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Service, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Service. We’ll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Service that would adversely affect you, but this isn’t always practical. Similarly, we reserve the right to remove any Content from the Service at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice.
