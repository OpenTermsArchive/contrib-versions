* **Financial Information:** credit card number, debit card number, bank account information and other financial information;
* **Demographic information:** gender, age, employment information and salary information;
* **Geolocation data;**
* **Internet or other electronic activity:** your browsing, search and click history, including information about how you navigate within This Website and the Services and which elements of This Website and the Services you use the most, and ratings and reviews or other content you post on This Website or to the Services;
* **Commercial information:** products or services purchased or viewed on This Website or through the Services;
* **Audio and visual information:** your videos and photos, such as audiovisual content you upload to your user profile and other audio or video recordings initiated by us; and
* **Inferences drawn from the categories described above** in order to create a profile about you to reflect your preferences, characteristics, behavior and attitude.

We do not use or disclose sensitive personal information, as defined by California law, for inferring characteristics or for purposes other than those permitted by law. We keep these categories of personal information as long as necessary or relevant for the purposes for which it was collected. We also keep information as required by law.

We may anonymize, aggregate or otherwise strip any personal information or other information we collect of all personally identifying characteristics and may use or share that aggregated, anonymized data with third parties for any purpose we deem appropriate.

**Free Text.** Please note that we may collect other Personal Information that you choose to provide in a free-text entry box, either as part of your User Account/Profile or as part of any Content you contribute to This Website or in connection with the Services.

Sources of Collection

We obtain the categories of Personal Information listed above from the following categories of sources:

* **We collect information directly from you.** We collect contact information, demographic information, sensitive personal information, audio and visual information, and financial information directly from you. For example, from forms you complete to register for a user account or create a user profile on This Website, when otherwise using the Services, or to provide feedback or suggestions about This Website or the Services. We also collect records of products or services you consider for purchase when you search for businesses on This Website or through the Services, ask questions in our Q&A section or request quotes or contacts from businesses who advertise with us.
* We collect information from you indirectly or passively.
    * We collect other identifying information, geolocation data, and internet and other electronic activity from you passively from you or your computers, devices or internet browsers. For example, This Website uses “cookies” on your browser that enable us to track your interactions with This Website, the Services and Ads, and our Apps may collect geolocation from your mobile device if you search for a business “near” your current location. This activity is further described in the Cookies and Advertising and Online Tracking sections below.
    * We collect contact information and sensitive personal information from you if you choose to link certain third-party email or messaging services (e.g., WhatsApp or Gmail) to your User Account/Profile or when you otherwise interact with these services on This Website or in connection with the Services. More information about what data may be shared when you choose to link your User Account will be available at the time of selection (e.g., by clicking the “Data and Permissions” tab when selecting an app in the Thryv app marketplace).
* We collect information about you from third parties.
    * We collect contact information and other identifying information from telephone carriers and providers. For instance, we collect caller ID information from incoming calls to our call tracking numbers, and we receive consumer information for the purpose of publishing White Pages residential telephone directories in certain geographic areas.
    * We collect contact information from your contacts. For example, if another user chooses to use an available referral or share feature on This Website or through the Services (e.g., to send a postcard, listing, page link, contest invitation, etc. to you), we may collect certain Personal Information about you as the recipient of the shared information (e.g., name, address, e-mail address, mobile telephone number). We only use this method of collection if permitted by laws in your jurisdiction.
    * We collect contact information and other identifying information from Social Networking Services. For example if you use Facebook or Google to sign-in to your account on This Website or to the Services, we collect such information about you that you permit the Social Networking Service to share with us.
    * We collect contact information, other identifying information, commercial information, geolocation data, and internet and electronic activity from Service Providers that collect certain Personal Information from or about you on our behalf, such as analytics software or platforms that we use to measure and analyze traffic to This Website, the Services or interaction with our Ads. For example, our Service Providers capture certain usage data to provide and analyze a “session replay” of your activities on This Website, which allows us to optimize This Website and the Services. The session replay may record, for example, clicks, mouse movements, scrolling, typing, navigation through This Website and the technical specifications of your device.
    * We collect contact information, other identifying information, demographic information, and commercial information from third party data suppliers. Thryv collects Personal Information such as your name and contact details from third party data suppliers. If your Personal Information was provided to us by a data supplier, we will have sought their confirmation that they are authorized under privacy laws to provide us with your Personal Information for the purposes described below.
    * We collect the Personal Information of our client’s customers. We may collect contact information, Sensitive Personal Information, demographic information, financial information and other Personal Information from businesses you interact with who use our products and services. For example, our clients may upload and store your Personal Information within our customer management products. We may only access or use this Personal information in limited circumstances—in our capacity as a service provider to our clients.

Notice to Residents of the United States

If you are a resident of California, or jurisdictions with similar laws (e.g., Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, Virginia), you may have certain additional privacy rights under the applicable privacy laws in your state (“State Privacy Laws”). This section generally describes those rights and how you can exercise them.

These rights are not absolute. In some situations we may not be able to process your request. This may include if a legal exception applies. We’ll let you know when or if a right doesn’t apply to you. You will not be discriminated against for exercising a privacy right. Those rights are:

1. **Access:** to learn the categories of information we collect and use, and for those in California, the categories of sources of collection and disclosure and the business purpose for collection;
2. **Portability:** a copy of (Virginia) or specific pieces of (California) Personal Information collected;
3. **Deletion:** to have us delete information we collected from you; and
4. **Correction:** asking us to fix your information.

We will also maintain a record of your rights requests.

Please note that if we delete your Personal Information, some of our services will not work the same. For example, your previous opt out requests will not be saved and saved preferences and information will no longer be available.

**Exercising your Rights:**

To exercise your rights, submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:

* Calling us toll-free at **1-877-380-1838**.
* Visit [here](https://privacyportal-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/dd6500c7-03cb-45b0-8bed-97ece55a892d/cfcefb69-41db-4aee-bd00-c702df72ee0f.html) to fill out and submit our web form.

Your verifiable consumer request must:

* Provide sufficient identifying information (including full name, postal address, and email address) to allow us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected and retained Personal Information, and/or your authority to make such request on behalf of the data subject, and
* Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

Note that we will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request or to review and comply with the request.

You may authorize someone to act as your agent and submit a request on your behalf. Due to the sensitivity of such requests, you must verify the agent’s authorization before we will act. Accordingly:

* You or your agent must supply proof that the agent is registered with the Secretary of State to act on your behalf; or
* You or your agent must supply other written permission for a specific agent to act on your behalf; and
* We will use your email address to connect directly with you to verify agent identity and authority.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm with a level of confidence appropriate to the sensitivity of the information that the Personal Information we have collected and retained in our systems and databases relates to you.

Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us, but if you have an account with us, we may require you to log-in to such account in order to verify your identity or authority or to provide or delete your information.

**Right to Opt-out of the Sale or Sharing of Personal Information**

Residents of certain jurisdictions (e.g., Colorado, Virginia) have the right to opt out of the “sale” or “sharing” of their personal data, as such terms are defined under State Privacy Laws.

Under California law, “share” means disclosing your personal information by us to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising, in exchange for money or anything else of value. Thus, when we use the term “share” under this section, we are using it in the narrow meaning of how it is defined under California law. Other State Privacy Laws do not use the term “share,” but describe the concept as using personal information for targeted advertising.

The term “sell” has a different meaning under certain State Privacy Laws. For example, under the laws of California and Colorado, “sell” means exchanging your personal information by us with a third party for money or anything else of value, while under Virginia law, “sell” is the exchange of personal information for money only.

Currently, we participate in digital advertising networks to deliver advertising that is tailored to your interests. The participation in certain ad networks can constitute a “sale” or “sharing” of personal data under State Privacy Laws. The categories of third parties to whom information may be disclosed in this context is our third party partners (e.g., advertisers and marketing partners and data analytics providers).

We may “sell” and/or “share” the following categories of Personal Information:

* Online Identifiers;
* Geolocation information;
* Internet/electronic activity;
* Commercial information.

You can opt-out of being tracked by these third parties by clicking the “DO NOT SELL OR SHARE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION” link at the bottom of our Website, or in the menu of the mobile application you are using, and selecting your preferences.

Please note that your opt-out preferences are website/device specific, so you will need to opt out on each APP and the following websites:

[YELLOWPAGES.com](https://yellowpages.com/) or [YP.com](https://yp.com/)  
[SUPERPAGES.com](https://www.superpages.com/)  
[DEXKNOWS.com](http://www.dexknows.com/)  
[THRYV.com](https://www.thryv.com/)  
[CORPORATE.THRYV.com](https://corporate.thryv.com/)  
[THEREALYELLOWPAGES.com](https://www.therealyellowpages.com/)

You can also opt-out by broadcasting an Opt-Out Preference Signal, such as the Global Privacy Control (GPC) (on the browsers and/or browser extensions that support such a signal). Note that we will only apply the request to that specific device or browser and only for cookie or pixel based selling and sharing. Thus, you will need opt out on each browser and device where you use our services. If you clear your cookie history on a particular browser or device, your opt out request will no longer be saved.

To learn more about these advertising practices or to opt out of this type of advertising of your personal data, please visit [https://optout.aboutads.info/](https://optout.aboutads.info/) and [https://www.networkadvertising.org/](https://www.networkadvertising.org/) to optout. You can also opt out of the re-sale of your Personal Information by other participants in these digital advertising networks by visiting this site and opting out of each participant’s digital property. Please note that, otherwise, Thryv does not presently exchange Personal Information for money with anyone, nor does Thryv otherwise “share” or “sell” Personal Information, as such terms are defined under applicable State Privacy Laws. Also, Thryv does not currently disclose Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

**Right to Opt-out of Profiling**

Residents of some jurisdictions (e.g., California, Colorado, Virginia) – subject to certain exceptions – may have a right to opt out of forms of automated processing performed on Personal Information to evaluate, analyze or predict personal aspects related to your economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behavior, location or movements (“**Profiling**”).

We engage in cookie-based or digital advertising-based Profiling. To opt out of this practice, please follow the instructions detailed above regarding opting out of the sale or sharing of your Personal Information.

We also engage in Profiling when evaluating individuals for our financial products and services, such as ThryvPay. The purpose of this Profiling is for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. This type of Profiling is not solely automated. Due to the nature and purpose of this Profiling, to the extent you chose to apply for or use Thryv’s financial products and services, you do not have an option to opt-out of this practice.

We may also engage in Profiling when we assess your interaction with this Website and our Services for the purpose of providing you information on additional products and services which may be of interest to you. Note, you can opt out of marketing emails as explained in the “Managing Your Marketing Preferences” section above.

We do not otherwise engage in Profiling.

**Right to Limit Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information**

Residents of some jurisdictions (e.g., California) have a right to limit the processing of their Sensitive Personal Information (as defined by the applicable State Privacy law).
