Personal Information We Collect

We may collect the following categories and types of “**Personal Information**”:

* **Contact information:** your first and last name, alias or username, mailing address, email address, and phone number;

* **Sensitive Personal Information:** government issued identification numbers (e.g., social security, insurance policy, driver’s license, state identification, passport, or similar identifiers); precise geolocation when you use the IYP mobile application to find businesses near you; medical and health information or health insurance information in limited circumstances and with your express consent when a business with whom you intentionally interact uses the Thryv Services as a service to store or process such information; message or email content (and associated metadata) when you choose to link certain third-party messaging or email services (e.g., WhatsApp or Gmail) to your User Account/Profile or when you interact with these services on This Website or in connection with the Services;
* **Financial Information:** credit card number, debit card number, bank account information and other financial information;
* **Demographic information:** gender, age, employment information and salary information;
* **Geolocation data;**
* **Internet or other electronic activity:** your browsing, search and click history, including information about how you navigate within This Website and the Services and which elements of This Website and the Services you use the most, and ratings and reviews or other content you post on This Website or to the Services;
* **Commercial information:** products or services purchased or viewed on This Website or through the Services;
* **Audio and visual information:** your videos and photos (and associated metadata), such as audiovisual content you upload to your user profile and other audio or video recordings initiated by us; and
* **Inferences drawn from the categories described above** in order to create a profile about you to reflect your preferences, characteristics, behavior and attitude.

We do not use or disclose sensitive personal information, as defined by California law, for inferring characteristics or for purposes other than those permitted by law. We keep these categories of personal information as long as necessary or relevant for the purposes for which it was collected. We also keep information as required by law.

We may anonymize, aggregate or otherwise strip any personal information or other information we collect of all personally identifying characteristics and may use or share that aggregated, anonymized data with third parties for any purpose we deem appropriate.

**Free Text.** Please note that we may collect other Personal Information that you choose to provide in a free-text entry box, either as part of your User Account/Profile or as part of any Content you contribute to This Website or in connection with the Services.

Sources of Collection

We obtain the categories of Personal Information listed above from the following categories of sources:

* **We collect information directly from you.** We collect contact information, demographic information, sensitive personal information, audio and visual information, and financial information directly from you. For example, from forms you complete to register for a user account or create a user profile on This Website, when otherwise using the Services, or to provide feedback or suggestions about This Website or the Services. We also collect records of products or services you consider for purchase when you search for businesses on This Website or through the Services, ask questions in our Q&A section or request quotes or contacts from businesses who advertise with us.
* We collect information from you indirectly or passively.
    * We collect other identifying information, geolocation data, and internet and other electronic activity from you passively from you or your computers, devices or internet browsers. For example, This Website uses “cookies” on your browser that enable us to track your interactions with This Website, the Services and Ads, and our Apps may collect geolocation from your mobile device if you search for a business “near” your current location. This activity is further described in the Cookies and Advertising and Online Tracking sections below.
    * We collect contact information and sensitive personal information from you if you choose to link certain third-party email or messaging services (e.g., WhatsApp or Gmail) to your User Account/Profile or when you otherwise interact with these services on This Website or in connection with the Services. More information about what data may be shared when you choose to link your User Account will be available at the time of selection (e.g., by clicking the “Data and Permissions” tab when selecting an app in the Thryv app marketplace).
* We collect information about you from third parties.
    * We collect contact information and other identifying information from telephone carriers and providers. For instance, we collect caller ID information from incoming calls to our call tracking numbers, and we receive consumer information for the purpose of publishing White Pages residential telephone directories in certain geographic areas.
    * We collect contact information from your contacts. For example, if another user chooses to use an available referral or share feature on This Website or through the Services (e.g., to send a postcard, listing, page link, contest invitation, etc. to you), we may collect certain Personal Information about you as the recipient of the shared information (e.g., name, address, e-mail address, mobile telephone number). We only use this method of collection if permitted by laws in your jurisdiction.
    * We collect contact information and other identifying information from Social Networking Services. For example if you use Facebook or Google to sign-in to your account on This Website or to the Services, we collect such information about you that you permit the Social Networking Service to share with us.
    * We collect contact information, other identifying information, commercial information, geolocation data, and internet and electronic activity from Service Providers that collect certain Personal Information from or about you on our behalf, such as analytics software or platforms that we use to measure and analyze traffic to This Website, the Services or interaction with our Ads. For example, our Service Providers capture certain usage data to provide and analyze a “session replay” of your activities on This Website, which allows us to optimize This Website and the Services. The session replay may record, for example, clicks, mouse movements, scrolling, typing, navigation through This Website and the technical specifications of your device.
    * We collect contact information, other identifying information, demographic information, and commercial information from third party data suppliers. Thryv collects Personal Information such as your name and contact details from third party data suppliers. If your Personal Information was provided to us by a data supplier, we will have sought their confirmation that they are authorized under privacy laws to provide us with your Personal Information for the purposes described below.
    * We collect the Personal Information of our client’s customers. We may collect contact information, sensitive Personal Information, demographic information, financial information and other Personal Information from businesses you interact with who use our products and services. For example, our clients may upload and store your Personal Information within our customer management products. We may only access or use this Personal information in limited circumstances—in our capacity as a service provider to our clients.

For example, we may contract with Service Providers to provide certain services, such as hosting and maintenance, data storage and management, and marketing and promotions. We only provide our Service Providers with the information necessary for them to perform these services on our behalf. Each Service Provider must agree to use reasonable security procedures and practices as required by law and appropriate to the nature of the information involved, in order to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Service Providers are prohibited from using Personal Information other than as specified by us.

Cookies

We use cookies (a small text file placed on your computer to identify your computer and web browser) and may use anonymous identifiers (a random string of characters that is used for the same purposes as a cookie). We use cookies and other similar technologies to analyze use of and improve This Website and the Services and as described in the Advertising and Online Tracking Section of this Privacy Policy. Most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies or other tracking tools. How you do so depends on the type of tool. Certain browsers can be set to reject browser cookies. If you block cookies, certain features on our Website or Services may not work. If you block or reject cookies, not all of the tracking described here will stop. Some of our Service Providers may use their own cookies, anonymous identifiers, or other tracking technology in connection with the services they perform on our behalf.

This Website may provide functionality to allow you to set your cookie preferences. This functionality relies on browser cookies to store your preferences. If you subsequently clear or delete your browser's cookies, the record of your cookie preferences will also be deleted, and we will not be able to honor your request until you update your preferences again.

We use third-party data analytics tools to analyze how users use the App and Services. For example, we use Google Analytics to provide statistics and analytical tools to analyze how users use the Website. For more information about how to opt out of having your information used by Google Analytics, visit [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

If you are a resident of New Zealand, we may use the Nielsen//NetRatings counting system to track common entry and exit points for the Website or Services, compiling anonymous information about usage of the Website and Services, and randomly and anonymously surveying users of the Website and Services. To do this, our Website and Services may include a small piece of code on each page which accumulates these statistics. For more information and to view Nielson//Net Ratings’ privacy policy, please visit [http://www.nielsen-online.com/corp.jsp?section=leg\_prs](http://www.nielsen-online.com/corp.jsp?section=leg_prs).

Options you make are browser and devise specific.

Session Replay Technology

We use session replay technology on our Website. Session replay technology, also referred to as session playback or user experience (UX) replay, collects information regarding, records, and tracks your interactions with a website or application. It then transforms those logged user events (such as mouse movements, clicks, page visits, scrolling, tapping, etc.) into a reproduction of what you actually did on the website or application. We use session replays for quality control, customer service, fraud prevention and security, and marketing purposes. Our session replay technology is owned and operated by a third-party who acts as our service provider. The information collected by this technology may be collected by, transferred to, and stored by our third-party service provider.

ChatBot Technology

We use chatbots to help provide customer service and support, including through the use of a virtual assistant. A chatbot is a software application that mimics human conversations in text or voice interactions on our website or through our customer service hotline. It enables the communication between a human and a machine, which can take the form of messages or voice commands. The chatbot is designed to work without the assistance of a human operator. It responds to questions posed to it in natural language as if it were a real person using a combination of pre-programmed scripts and machine learning algorithms. When asked a question, the chatbot will answer using the knowledge database that is currently available to it. If the conversation introduces a concept it isn’t programmed to understand; it will pass it to a human operator. If you use our chatbot service, we will collect any Personal Information you provide to us. We will also create and store a transcript of your chat interaction with us which will be shared with and stored by our third-party service provider. We use these transcripts and the information you provide for quality control, customer service, fraud prevention and security.

Advertising and Online Tracking

We may place advertisements and allow third-party companies to serve ads and collect certain information when you visit this Website or use the Services. These companies may use certain information (e.g. click stream information, web browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this Website and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of interest to you (i.e., for cross-contextual behavioral advertising). These companies may also collect information about your activities on our Website on your current device and combine it with information about your activities on other websites, mobile apps, and devices. These companies typically collect such information using server logs, cookies, web beacons, tags, pixels, mobile advertising IDs (such as Facebook cookies or Google's Advertising ID), cross-device linking, and similar technologies. They may match your browsers or devices if you log into the same online service on multiple devices or if your devices share similar attributes that support an inference that they are used by the same person or household. This means that information about your activity on websites or apps on your current browser or device may be combined and used with information collected from your other browsers or devices. These third party partners use this information for our and their own advertising, analytics, attribution, and reporting purposes. Our systems do not recognize browser “Do Not Track” signals, but several of our Service Providers who utilize these cookies on this Website enable you to opt out of targeted advertising practices. To learn more about these advertising practices or to opt out of this type of advertising, you can visit [www.networkadvertising.org](https://www.networkadvertising.org/) or [www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) (for US residents), or [https://youradchoices.ca](https://youradchoices.ca/) (for Canadian residents) or [http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/what-are-my-options](http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/what-are-my-options).

Some browsers or browser extensions also allow you to tell websites not to share your information for cross-contextual behavioral advertising through the “global privacy control” signal. We will respond to this signal in a frictionless manner. If you configure this setting on your browser, certain features on our site may not work and you will receive less targeted advertising.

Options you make are device specific.

Residents of some jurisdictions (e.g., California, Virginia, Colorado, Montana) have the ability to opt out of cross-contextual behavioral advertising through other means. Please see the Right to Opt-out of Sale or Sharing section below.

Managing Your Marketing Preferences

Once you have opted in to receive our marketing emails, you can opt out of receiving marketing e-mails from us by following the Unsubscribe link provided at the bottom of all marketing e-mails you receive from us. You are able to opt out of receiving marketing e-mails from us, however, if you continue to use our services we will still need to email you from time to time about your account.

Managing Your Profile Information

If you register with us and create a profile, you can review and request changes to the personal information in your profile at any time. You can do this by signing into your profile and, depending on the site or Service, either editing or asking us to delete it for you.

YellowPages or YP: [https://accounts.yellowpages.com/login](https://accounts.yellowpages.com/login).

Be Careful When You Share Information with Others

Please be aware that whenever you share information on any public area of this Website or the Services, that information may be accessed by others. In addition, please remember that when you share information in any other communications with third parties, that information may be passed along or made public by others. This means that anyone with access to such information can potentially use it for any purpose, including sending unsolicited communications. We cannot control and are not responsible for what such third parties may do with your information, so you should exercise caution when choosing to share it.

Security

We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to help protect the confidentiality and security of information transmitted to us. It is also important for you to protect against unauthorized access of any account password or your computer. Personal information may be accessed by persons within our organization, or other entities described in this Privacy Policy, or our third-party service providers, who require such access to carry out the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law.

However, no data transmission over the Internet or other network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and no security measures can provide absolute protection. As a result, while we strive to protect information transmitted on or through this Website or the Services, we cannot and do not guarantee the security of any information you transmit on or through this Website or the Services or that you otherwise provide to us, and you do so at your own risk.

Links; Third Party Platforms

This Website and the Services may contain links to other websites or allow others to send you such links. A link to a third party’s website does not mean that we endorse it or that we are affiliated with it. We do not exercise control over third-party websites and are not responsible for their practices. You access such third-party websites or content at your own risk. You should always read the privacy policy of a third-party website before providing any information to the website.

Additionally, the Website or Services may contain or link (via API or otherwise) content provided by third party sites, providers or social media platforms such as Facebook and YouTube (collectively, “**Third Party Platforms**”). When you interact with such Third Party Platform(s), including by interacting with third party content made available on the Website or through the Services, the associated collection and processing of your Personal Information will be subject to the privacy policy of such Third Party Platform(s). You should review the privacy policies of these Third Party Platforms before interacting with them.

For example, our Yellow Pages website located at [https://www.yellowpages.com.au/](https://www.yellowpages.com.au/) ("**Yellow**”), uses YouTube™ API Services. Your interaction with any video identified as being hosted on the YouTube video community is subject to the Google Privacy Policy located at [http://www.google.com/policies/privacy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy).

Similarly, our SMS feature made available to customers in the US and Canada uses Twilio to provide the SMS services. If you choose to enable this product feature, your interaction with the SMS service is subject to the Twilio privacy policy located at [https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/privacy](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/privacy).

Children’s Privacy

This Website and the Services are intended for and directed to a general adult audience. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 16. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received Personal Information from a child, we will delete such information from our records.

Processing Location

Please be aware that your Personal Information and communications may be transferred to and maintained on servers or databases located outside your state, province, or country. Please be advised that we store all information in the United States or Australia. Additionally, we may process information in multiple locations, including without limitation, the United States, Australia, Canada, Colombia, Dominican Republic, the European Economic Area (“**EEA**”), India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, Tunisia, and the United Kingdom.

Although we will make all reasonable efforts to ensure your personal information is protected in accordance with our obligations, the laws in these countries may not be as protective of your privacy as those in your location. Personal information processed and stored in another country may be subject to disclosure or access requests by the governments, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies in that country according to its laws. By using This Website or Services, you are agreeing to the collection, use, transfer, and disclosure of your Personal Information and communications will be governed by the applicable laws in the United States and/or the applicable country of processing. If you have any questions regarding international data transfers, you may contact us using the contact information we provide below.

Notice to Residents of the United States

If you are a resident of California, or jurisdictions with similar laws (e.g., Colorado, Connecticut, Montana, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Virginia), you may have certain additional privacy rights under the applicable privacy laws in your state (“**State Privacy Laws**”). This section generally describes those rights and how you can exercise them.

These rights are not absolute. In some situations we may not be able to process your request. This may include if a legal exception applies. These rights may be offered based on your location. We’ll let you know when or if a right doesn’t apply to you. You will not be discriminated against for exercising a privacy right. Those rights are:

1. **Access:** to learn the categories and specific pieces of information we collect, use, disclose and sell; for those in California, the categories of sources of collection, the third parties to whom the information is disclosed or sold, and the business purpose for such collection or disclosure; for those in Oregon, a list of specific third parties (as defined under Oregon law), to whom we have disclosed Personal Information;
2. **Portability:** a copy of (e.g., Virginia, Montana) or specific pieces of (e.g., California) Personal Information collected;
3. **Deletion:** to have us delete information we collected from you; and
4. **Correction:** asking us to fix your information.

We will also maintain a record of your rights requests.

Please note that if we delete your Personal Information, some of our services will not work the same. For example, your previous opt out requests will not be saved and saved preferences and information will no longer be available.

**Exercising your Rights:**

To exercise your rights, submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:

* Calling us toll-free at **1-877-380-1838**.
* Visit [here](https://privacyportal-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/dd6500c7-03cb-45b0-8bed-97ece55a892d/cfcefb69-41db-4aee-bd00-c702df72ee0f.html) to fill out and submit our web form.

Your verifiable consumer request must:

* Provide sufficient identifying information (including full name, postal address, and email address) to allow us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected and retained Personal Information, and/or your authority to make such request on behalf of the data subject, and
* Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

Note that we will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request or to review and comply with the request.

You may authorize someone to act as your agent and submit a request on your behalf. Due to the sensitivity of such requests, you must verify the agent’s authorization before we will act. Accordingly:

* You or your agent must supply proof that the agent is registered with the Secretary of State to act on your behalf; or
* You or your agent must supply other written permission for a specific agent to act on your behalf; and
* We will use your email address to connect directly with you to verify agent identity and authority.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm with a level of confidence appropriate to the sensitivity of the information that the Personal Information we have collected and retained in our systems and databases relates to you.

Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us, but if you have an account with us, we may require you to log-in to such account in order to verify your identity or authority or to provide or delete your information.

**Right to Opt-out of the Sale or Sharing of Personal Information**

Residents of certain jurisdictions (e.g., California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, Texas, Oregon, Montana, Virginia) have the right to opt out of the “sale” or “sharing” of their personal data, as such terms are defined under State Privacy Laws.

Under California law, “share” means disclosing your personal information by us to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising, in exchange for money or anything else of value. Thus, when we use the term “share” under this section, we are using it in the narrow meaning of how it is defined under California law. Other State Privacy Laws do not use the term “share,” but describe the concept as using personal information for targeted advertising.

The term “sell” has a different meaning under certain State Privacy Laws. For example, under the laws of California and Colorado, “sell” means exchanging your personal information by us with a third party for money or anything else of value, while under Virginia law, “sell” is the exchange of personal information for money only.

Currently, we participate in digital advertising networks to deliver advertising that is tailored to your interests. The participation in certain ad networks can constitute a “sale” or “sharing” of personal data under State Privacy Laws. The categories of third parties to whom information may be disclosed in this context is our third party partners (e.g., advertisers and marketing partners and data analytics providers).

We may “sell” and/or “share” the following categories of Personal Information:

* Online Identifiers;
* Geolocation information;
* Internet/electronic activity;
* Commercial information.

You can opt-out of being tracked by these third parties by clicking the “DO NOT SELL OR SHARE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION” link at the bottom of our Website, or in the menu of the mobile application you are using, and selecting your preferences.

Please note that your opt-out preferences are website/device specific, so you will need to opt out on each APP and the following websites:
