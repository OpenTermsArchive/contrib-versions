We may anonymize, aggregate or otherwise strip any personal information or other information we collect of all personally identifying characteristics and may use or share that aggregated, anonymized data with third parties for any purpose we deem appropriate.

**Free Text.** Please note that we may collect other Personal Information that you choose to provide in a free-text entry box, either as part of your User Account/Profile or as part of any Content you contribute to This Website or in connection with the Services.

**Message or Email Content.** We may also collect other Personal Information in the form of message or email content when you choose to link certain third-party messaging or email services (e.g., WhatsApp or Gmail) to your User Account/Profile or when you interact with these services on This Website or in connection with the Services.

Sources of Collection

We obtain the categories of Personal Information listed above from the following categories of sources:

*   Directly from You. For example, from forms you complete to register for a user account or create a user profile on This Website, when otherwise using the Services, or to provide feedback or suggestions about This Website or the Services. We also collect records of products or services you consider for purchase when you search for businesses on This Website or through the Services, ask questions in our Q&A section or request quotes or contacts from businesses who advertise with us.
*   Indirectly or passively from you or your computers, devices or internet browsers. For example, This Website use “cookies” on your browser that enable us to track your interactions with This Website, the Services and Ads, and our Apps may collect geolocation from your mobile device if you search for a business “near” your current location. This activity is further described in the Cookies and Advertising and Online Tracking sections below.
*   Indirectly or passively from you if you choose to link certain third-party email or messaging services (e.g., WhatsApp or Gmail) to your User Account/Profile or when you otherwise interact with these services on This Website or in connection with the Services.

We will also maintain a record of your CCPA Rights requests.

Please note that if we delete your Personal Information, some of our services will not work the same. For example, your previous opt out requests will not be saved and saved preferences and information will no longer be available.

**Exercising your Rights:**

To exercise your right to know or delete your Personal Information, submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:

*   Calling us at **1-877-380-1838**.
*   Visit [here](https://privacyportal-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/dd6500c7-03cb-45b0-8bed-97ece55a892d/cfcefb69-41db-4aee-bd00-c702df72ee0f.html) to fill out and submit our web form request to access or delete your Personal Data.

Your verifiable consumer request must:

*   Provide sufficient identifying information (including full name, postal address, and email address) to allow us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected and retained Personal Information, and/or your authority to make such request on behalf of the data subject, and
*   Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

Note that we will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request or to review and comply with the request.

You may authorize someone to act as your agent and submit a request on your behalf. Due to the sensitivity of such requests, you must verify the agent’s authorization before we will act. Accordingly:

*   You or your agent must supply written permission for a specific agent to act on your behalf; and
*   We will use your email address to connect directly with you to verify agent identity and authority.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm with a level of confidence appropriate to the sensitivity of the information that the Personal Information we have collected and retained in our systems and databases relates to you.

Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us, but if you have an account with us, we may require you to log-in to such account in order to verify your identity or authority or to provide or delete your information.

_Right to Opt Out of Sale_

California residents have the right to opt out of the sale of your Personal Information to third parties, as “sale” is defined under CCPA.

Currently, we participate in digital advertising networks to deliver advertising that is tailored to your interests. The participation in certain ad networks can constitute a “sale” of Personal Information under CCPA. To learn more about these advertising practices or to opt out of this type of advertising of your Personal Information, please visit [https://optout.aboutads.info/](https://optout.aboutads.info/) and [https://www.networkadvertising.org/](https://www.networkadvertising.org/) to optout. You can opt out of the re-sale of your Personal Information by other participants in these digital advertising networks by visiting this [site](https://www.iabprivacy.com/optout.html) and opting out of each participant’s digital property.

Please note that, otherwise, Thryv does not presently exchange Personal Information for money with anyone, nor does Thryv otherwise share Personal Information within the meaning of “sale.” Also, Thryv does not currently disclose Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by visiting the following Internet Web page links for each of the following of our Websites:

[CORPORATE.THRYV.com](https://corporate.thryv.com/)  
[THEREALYELLOWPAGES.com](https://www.therealyellowpages.com/)

And clicking on the button labeled “DO NOT SELL MY PERSONAL INFORMATION”

Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize Personal Information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt back in to Personal Information sales at any time.

**Non-Discrimination; Financial Incentives**

We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA Rights and we will not deny you goods or services, charge you a different price, or provide you with a lesser quality of goods or services if you exercise any of your CCPA Rights.

However, we may offer various financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that **can result** in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your Personal Information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
