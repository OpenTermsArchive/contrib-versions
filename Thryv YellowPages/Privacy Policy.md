**Exercising your Rights:**

To exercise your right to know or delete your Personal Information, submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:

*   Calling us at 1-877-380-1838.
*   Visiting [https://corporate.thryv.com/privacy-CCPA](https://corporate.thryv.com/privacy-CCPA) to fill out and submit our web form request to access or delete your Personal Data.

Your verifiable consumer request must:

*   Provide sufficient identifying information (including full name, postal address, and email address) to allow us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected and retained Personal Information, and/or your authority to make such request on behalf of the data subject, and
*   Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

Note that we will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request or to review and comply with the request.

You may authorize someone to act as your agent and submit a request on your behalf. Due to the sensitivity of such requests, you must verify the agent’s authorization before we will act. Accordingly:

*   You or your agent must supply written permission for a specific agent to act on your behalf; and

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm with a level of confidence appropriate to the sensitivity of the information that the Personal Information we have collected and retained in our systems and databases relates to you.

Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us, but if you have an account with us, we may require you to log-in to such account in order to verify your identity or authority or to provide or delete your information.

**Do Not Sell My Personal Information**

California residents have the right to opt out of the sale of your Personal Information to third parties, as “sale” is defined under CCPA.

Currently, we participate in digital advertising networks to deliver advertising that is tailored to your interests. The participation in certain ad networks can constitute a “sale” of Personal Information under CCPA.

Please note that, otherwise, Thryv does not presently exchange Personal Information for money with anyone, nor does Thryv otherwise share Personal Information within the meaning of “sale.” Also, Thryv does not currently disclose Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by visiting the following Internet Web page links for each of the following of our Websites:

Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize Personal Information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt back in to Personal Information sales at any time.

**Non-Discrimination; Financial Incentives**

We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA Rights and we will not deny you goods or services, charge you a different price, or provide you with a lesser quality of goods or services if you exercise any of your CCPA Rights.

Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
