**4\. Data Transfer to Other Instances**

Our federated Lemmy instance operates on a decentralized model, which means that data may be transferred to and shared with other instances within the Fediverse network. This is an inherent feature of the Lemmy platform’s architecture, designed to allow users to interact with content and users across different instances while maintaining control over their data.

When you create an account, post content, comment, or engage in any activity on [feddit.de](http://feddit.de/), some of your data may be replicated and shared with other instances through a process called federation. This allows users from various instances to view and interact with your content, comments, and activities.

It’s important to understand that when your data is federated, it remains subject to the privacy policies and terms of use of both [feddit.de](http://feddit.de/) and the instance to which it is shared. We do not have direct control over how other instances handle your data, and their data protection practices may vary.

We recommend that you review the privacy policies and terms of use of the instances you interact with to understand how your data may be used, shared, and protected. While we strive to promote responsible data handling and protection within the Fediverse network, it’s essential to be aware of the decentralized nature of the platform and its implications for data transfer.

By using [feddit.de](http://feddit.de/), you acknowledge and consent to the possibility of your data being transferred to other instances as part of the federation process. If you have concerns about data transfer or data protection, please feel free to contact us, and we will do our best to address your inquiries.

**5\. Data Retention**

We will retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy or as required by law. You may request the deletion of your account and associated data from this instance at any time.

**6\. Your Rights**

You have the right to:

* Access and rectify your personal data.
* Withdraw your consent at any time.
* Request the erasure of your personal data.
* Object to the processing of your personal data.
* Lodge a complaint with a data protection authority.

**7\. Security**

We take reasonable measures to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. However, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed as completely secure.
