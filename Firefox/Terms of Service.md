Firefox Terms of Use
====================

Firefox is free and open source web browser software, built by a community of thousands from all over the world.

Please read these Terms of Use (“Terms”) carefully because they explain important information about using your copy of the Firefox software. These Terms are a binding agreement between Mozilla Corporation (“Mozilla”) and You. For details about Firefox privacy practices, please read the [Firefox Privacy Notice](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/firefox/).

Mozilla Gives You Certain Rights and Permissions
------------------------------------------------

Mozilla grants you a personal, non-exclusive license to install and use the “Executable Code" version of the Firefox web browser, which is the ready-to-run version of Firefox from an authorized source that you can open and use right away.

### Firefox is Open Source Software

We make the source code for Firefox available to you under the terms of various open source licenses, including the [Mozilla Public License](https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/). This means you may use, copy, modify, and distribute Firefox to others, as long as you follow the open source licenses and the [Mozilla Trademark Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/foundation/trademarks/policy/). These Terms only apply to the Executable Code version of Firefox, not the Firefox source code.

In order to play certain types of video, Firefox may download content decryption modules from third parties which may not be open source.

### Mozilla’s Intellectual Property

Mozilla does not grant you any intellectual property rights in Firefox that are not specifically stated in these Terms. For example, these Terms do not give you rights to use any copyrights, trademarks, or other distinctive brand features of Mozilla or its licensors.

You Give Mozilla Certain Rights and Permissions
-----------------------------------------------

You give Mozilla the rights necessary to operate Firefox. This includes processing your data as we describe in the [Firefox Privacy Notice](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/firefox/). It also includes a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license for the purpose of doing as you request with the content you input in Firefox. This does not give Mozilla any ownership in that content.

### Your Feedback and Suggestions

If you give Mozilla any ideas, suggestions, or feedback about the Services, you give Mozilla permission to use them for free and without any additional obligations.

If You Use Certain Optional Firefox Features or Services, There are Additional Terms
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Some Services in Firefox Require a Mozilla Account

If you want to use certain services like sync, you’ll need a Mozilla account. To create a Mozilla account, you will also need to agree to the [Terms of Service](https://www.mozilla.org/about/legal/terms/services/) and [Privacy Notice](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/mozilla-accounts/) for Mozilla accounts.

### Other Optional Services

Some features in Firefox require you to opt in to them specifically. In order to use them, you will need to agree to the specific Terms and Privacy Notice for each service you use.

Mozilla Can Update or Terminate This Agreement
----------------------------------------------

### Mozilla Can Update These Terms

Every once in a while, Mozilla may decide to update these Terms. We will post the updated Terms online. We will take your continued use of Firefox as acceptance of such changes. We will post an effective date at the top of this page to make it clear when we made our most recent update.

### Termination

These Terms apply until either you or Mozilla decide to end them. You can choose to end them at any time for any reason by stopping your use of Firefox. Mozilla can suspend or end anyone’s access to Firefox at any time for any reason, including if Mozilla decides not to offer Firefox anymore. If we decide to suspend or end your access, we will try to notify you at the email address associated with your account or the next time you attempt to access your account.

You Are Responsible for the Consequences of Your Use of Firefox
---------------------------------------------------------------

You agree that you will not use Firefox to infringe anyone’s rights or violate any applicable laws or regulations.

You will not do anything that interferes with or disrupts Mozilla’s services or products (or the servers and networks which are connected to Mozilla’s services).

You Won’t Claim Mozilla is Responsible for Your Use of Firefox (Indemnification)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**You agree to indemnify and hold Mozilla and its affiliates harmless for any liability or claim from your use of Firefox, to the extent permitted by applicable law.**

There are Some Important Limitations on Mozilla’s Liability
-----------------------------------------------------------

**To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree that Mozilla will not be liable in any way for any inability to use Firefox or for any limitations of Firefox. Mozilla specifically disclaims the following: Indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or exemplary damages, direct or indirect damages for loss of goodwill, business interruption, lost profits, loss of data, or computer malfunction. Any liability for Mozilla under this agreement is limited to $500.**

You may have other rights under your own country’s laws. Nothing in these Terms is intended to affect those rights, if they apply.

Firefox is Provided “As is” (Warranty Disclaimer)
-------------------------------------------------

**Mozilla provides Firefox “as is.” To the extent applicable law allows, Mozilla and its affiliates specifically disclaim any legal guarantees or warranties such as “merchantability,” “fitness for a particular purpose,” “non-infringement,” and warranties arising out of a course of dealing, usage, or trade.**
