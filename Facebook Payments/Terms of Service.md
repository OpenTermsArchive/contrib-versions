Community Payments Terms

Last updated: 18 April 2025

**If you are under the age of eighteen (18), or age of majority in the state or country of your residence, you may only use payments features through the Meta Products with the involvement of your parent or guardian. Make sure that you review the Payments Terms with your parent or guardian so that you both understand all of your rights and responsibilities.**

We have provided some section headers for your convenience, but you should carefully read through these Community Payments Terms (the "Payments Terms") in order to understand your rights and responsibilities, as well as ours.  
  

Capitalised terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in our [Terms of Service](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms) ("Terms").  
  

By agreeing to these Payment Terms and if you are a business entity, you represent and warrant that a) you are duly authorised to do business in the country or countries where you operate; b) your employees, officers or representatives accessing payment services through the Meta Products are duly authorised and able to legally bind you to these Payment Terms and all payment transactions conducted under your username and password; and c) your access and/or use of the Meta Products are for solely or primarily for business or commercial purposes, and not for personal, family or household purposes.

  

When you make payments or store a payment instrument through the Meta Products, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically any important information regarding your payments, transactions or your account.

Protecting the privacy of your financial information is important to us. Please review Meta Platforms Inc.'s Privacy Policy ([https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy](https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy)), Meta Payments Inc.'s [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/payments_terms/privacy), as well as Facebook Payments International Limited's [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/payments_terms/EU_privacy) for the applicable services, to learn more about what information we share, what we do not share and how we keep your information safe.

  

**I. Making payments**

1. Payment transactions. When you make a payment or store a payment instrument through the Meta Products, you agree to be bound by these Payments Terms and to provide a valid payment instrument. When you successfully add your payment instrument to your account (see Clause II below), we will allow you to initiate a payment transaction using the payments features through the Meta Products. For clarity, a payment instrument includes a credit card, debit card, bank account number and other payment methods that enable electronic funds transfers, debits and credits as expressly permitted by Meta from time to time.
2. Pricing. Pay attention to the details of the transaction, because your total price may include taxes, fees and delivery costs, all of which you are responsible for paying. You are responsible for providing us with true and accurate information about you and your business for tax and compliance purposes. We may obtain information about you/your business from third parties for tax and compliance purposes.
3. Extra terms. You may be presented with additional terms before you confirm the transaction (such as delivery terms for tangible goods). By proceeding with or confirming the transaction, you agree that those additional terms will also govern that transaction.
4. Foreign Exchange. If your transaction requires a currency exchange, we will use the most recent foreign exchange rates sourced by one or more external vendors. We aim to upload files from our vendors with the current exchange rates into our system on a daily basis. However, these processes could be delayed or fail for any number of reasons. If this happens, the foreign exchange rates used will be the ones from the last file received, typically, the ones from the previous day.
5. Subscriptions. If you purchase an auto-recurring periodic subscription from us, you authorise us to bill your payment instrument immediately and then again at the beginning of each subscription period, according to the applicable subscription terms and until you cancel your subscription. Cancellations will apply to the next billing period. Except as otherwise set forth in the terms of your subscription, the following terms apply for subscriptions purchased using payment services through the Meta Products:
    1. If a free trial period is offered and you do not cancel during this trial period, and if you have given any consents if required by law, you will be billed at the end of the free trial period and at the beginning of each subsequent subscription period. To avoid any charges, you must cancel before the end of the trial period.
    2. We will continue to bill your payment credential each subscription period until you've cancelled. To avoid being charged your next subscription payment, you must cancel at least 24 hours before your next scheduled payment date.
    3. If you cancel a subscription, you will still have access to the app or feature that you subscribed to until the end of the subscription period. You will not receive a refund for the current billing period, except in the event of defect or as otherwise set out in any applicable subscription terms.
    4. When you purchase a subscription, you will initially be charged at the rate applicable at the time of your agreement to subscribe. If the price of the subscription increases later, we will notify you. The increase will apply to the next payment due from you after the notice, provided that you have been given prior notice as required by law, and in no case less than 10 days prior notice before the change is made. If you are given less than the applicable notice period, the price increase will not apply until the payment after the next payment due. If you do not wish to pay the increased price for a subscription, you may cancel the subscription in the manner described in the applicable subscription terms or in the Help Centre.
    5. This Section 5 does not apply to subscriptions purchased from a third party through any of the Meta Products. Any such subscription terms, including cancellation and subscription period are between you and the third party from whom you purchased your subscription and you should contact that third party, and not Meta, for any questions related to your subscription. Notwithstanding the foregoing, when using Meta Products and making a purchase using Apple in-app purchase ("Apple IAP") functionality integrated into Meta Products, you hereby grant Meta the right to initiate refunds on your behalf to Apple, Inc. ("Apple") for any purchase and payment transactions, including non-recurring transactions, made using Apple IAP. This includes, but is not limited to, refunds due to errors, disputes or customer services issues, and fraudulent transactions. Refunds will be initiated under circumstances deemed necessary by Meta. All refunds initiated by Meta on your behalf will comply with Apple's refund policies and applicable laws and regulations. You acknowledge and agree that Meta will not be held liable for any losses or damages resulting from refunds initiated by us on your behalf to Apple.
6. Advertising/Other Services: You authorise us to use the payment instruments to purchase ads, marketing services or other services. Depending on the payment option, we will automatically bill your payment instrument(s) upon the due dates or when your payment threshold or limit is met.
7. Person-to-Person Transfers. Person-to-person transfer of funds ("P2P") may be made available at our sole discretion. If you use P2P in the Messenger service, you consent to the following terms:
    1. You may not use P2P if you are under the age of 18.
    2. We may require that you provide more information in order to complete a transaction.
    3. P2P is not intended to be used for business, commercial or merchant transactions and such use may be discontinued without notice by us at any time. We may reverse or place a hold on your transactions or place funds in reserve if evidence of business, commercial or merchant use is discovered.
    4. If you receive and accept a P2P transfer, you are liable to us for the payment transferred and third-party fees that result from invalidation of that payment. This includes, but is not limited to, reversed payments or if you lose a claim or a chargeback. We reserve the right to charge your payment instrument or take any other legal action to collect the funds to the full extent allowed by applicable law.
    5. P2P must be used in compliance with applicable law and may not be used in connection with any illegal or illicit transaction. In addition, payments relating to the following activities are prohibited regardless of whether the activity is illegal in your location: (a) weapons, ammunition or explosives; and (b) gambling, games of skill, lotteries, raffles or fantasy sports. If illegal, illicit or otherwise prohibited transactions are reported or discovered, we reserve the right to take action including, without limitation, the following, without notice to you: place a hold on your transactions, place your funds in reserve, limit your ability to use payments features through the Meta Products, report the activity to authorities or deactivate your account entirely.
    6. P2P use is at your sole risk and we assume no responsibility for the underlying transaction of funds, or the actions or identity of any transfer recipient or sender. Disputes regarding funds are between you and the sender of a payment. If a sender files a claim for a chargeback after a P2P transaction, we are not responsible for determining the veracity of claims or the disposition of the payment.
    7. Minnesota residents: To opt out of P2P, please send written notice of your choice to: Meta Payments Inc. (NMLS ID 918740), 1 Meta Way, Menlo Park, CA, 94025, US. Note that opting out of P2P may affect your ability to make other transactions using payments features through the Meta Products.
8. Payments to Developers in the US. We serve as a limited payment collection agent for some developers offering content through the Meta Products, and we are authorised to accept payment from you on behalf of those developers for purchase of that content. Your full payment to us of the transaction price for a developer's content constitutes payment to that developer and satisfies your payment obligations to that developer for the purchased content.
9. Payments to Developers in the European Economic Area. To make a payment to a developer offering content through the Meta Products, you must use the account that we provide to you, which can only be used to purchase digital content through the Meta Products. You can top up this account using a variety of payment methods, such as a credit card, debit card or Facebook gift card. **Where you make a payment to a developer offering content through the Meta Products in the European Economic Area, this is not a regulated payment service. Therefore, with respect to this payment service, you acknowledge that you will not benefit from the customer protections available to payment service users under the applicable regulatory framework when a regulated payment service is provided (e.g. refund rights for unauthorised transactions, safeguarding of funds).**
10. Donations. If you make a donation to a charity on the Meta Products, the following terms apply:
    1. _Donations made to PayPal Giving Fund ("PPGF"), including in the US, Canada, Australia and the UK._ PPGF is a registered public charity, which means your donation will be made to PPGF and not directly to your designated charity. Donations are processed by PayPal, PPGF's third-party service provider and received by the PPGF entity registered in the associated country, subject to PPGF's [Terms and Policies](https://www.facebook.com/help/147103245075576). Each time you make a donation to PPGF on the Meta Products, you agree to PPGF's [Terms and Policies](https://www.facebook.com/help/147103245075576). When you make a donation to PPGF, you are recommending that PPGF make a corresponding grant to the designated charity in the amount of your donation. PPGF will grant the funds you donate to your designated charity in accordance with their policies. PPGF will email you an official donation receipt for tax records. You agree that we do not make any endorsements or representations about PPGF or your designated charity, and are not liable for PPGF's or your designated charity's acts or omissions.
    2. When you make a donation, you acknowledge that you make this donation as a charitable contribution and that you are not receiving any goods or services in return. As the tax laws vary by state and by country, please consult a tax professional regarding the deductibility of this donation. We make no representations or warranties with respect to the charitable status of a charity or eligibility for any tax-related benefits or deductions arising out of a donation.
    3. We reserve the right to refuse to process your donation if the designated charity fails to comply with our terms and policies, including our Charitable Donation Terms. If we refuse to process a donation, you may be entitled to a refund subject to PPGF's [Terms and Policies](https://www.facebook.com/help/147103245075576).
    4. Fundraising campaigns to benefit charities may be created by users ("Fundraiser Creators"). If a Fundraiser Creator pledges to match donations to a fundraising campaign, you acknowledge that we do not guarantee that the Fundraiser Creator will fulfil the pledge. If you donate to a charity through such a fundraising campaign, it is subject to PPGF's [Terms and Policies](https://www.facebook.com/help/147103245075576), including any refund rights.
    5. If you agree to make donations to PPGF on a recurring basis, you authorise us to store your payment instrument and to process your donations through PayPal, PPGF's payment processor. Your payment instrument will be charged immediately for the first donation, and then again at the beginning of each recurring donation period. Your payment instrument will be charged automatically each recurring donation period until you cancel, which you can do at any time on your Account settings page. To avoid being charged your next donation, you must cancel at least 24 hours before your next scheduled donation.
    6. You agree that we are not making any endorsements or representations about the charity and are not liable for their acts or omissions.
    7. We may make available to you the ability to cover certain fees in connection with your donation. To the extent that you agree to cover such fees, the total amount charged to you will include both the donation amount and such fees.
11. Request a Hold. When you request a hold on an item in Marketplace ("Request a Hold"), we obtain pre-approval from the issuer of your selected payment method for an amount determined by the cost of the item ("Hold Amount"). This amount will be released back to you when the seller marks the item as sold, if the seller doesn't accept your request within 24 hours or if either of you needs to cancel.
12. No Warranties. UNLESS OTHERWISE EXPLICITLY PROVIDED BY US IN WRITING FOR A PARTICULAR PRODUCT OR SERVICE, AND FOR THOSE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT YOU PURCHASED THAT ARE SOLD BY THIRD PARTIES, WE MAKE NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES PROVIDED OR SOLD ON OR THROUGH THE META PRODUCTS.

**II. Payment methods**

1. Payment instrument. For your convenience, we may allow you to fund your transactions using a number of different payment instruments, such as credit cards, debit cards and Facebook gift cards. You can store your payment instrument, and you can add, update or remove payment instruments to or from your account at any time through your Orders and payments within your Instagram or Facebook settings. Any refund that we owe to you may be credited to the same payment instrument that you used for the original payment transaction. If your original payment instrument is no longer available, we reserve the right to decline the refund or credit your refund to another payment instrument in your account or by other means that we deem appropriate. You agree to keep your stored payment instruments(s) up to date. If we participate in a card account updater service, you authorise us to contact your card issuer or card network to obtain up-to-date information about your payment instrument, and to automatically update your payment instrument, including your account number or expiration date, if such information is available.
2. Your authorisation. When you fund your transaction or provide us with a payment instrument, you confirm that you are permitted to use that payment instrument or have permitted a user to use the payment instrument. When you fund or initiate a transaction, you authorise us (and our designated payment processor) to charge up to the full amount to your payment instrument. Where necessary to process your transactions with third-party merchants through the Meta Products, you permit us to share your payment instrument details and other information necessary to process your payment, with the merchant, their commerce services platform and their payment processors. In accordance with Section 1 above, you also authorise us to collect and store that payment instrument, along with other related transaction information.
3. Pre-authorisation hold. If you pay by credit or debit card, we may obtain a pre-authorisation from the issuer of the card for an amount, which may be as high as the full price of your payment. Such pre-authorisation may appear as a "hold" on your credit card or funds associated with your debit card. Your card will be charged at the time that a payment is initiated, or shortly thereafter. If you cancel a transaction before completion, this pre-authorisation may result in credit or funds not being immediately available to you until your issuer has released the hold.
4. Failed payments. If your transaction results in an overdraft or other fee from your card issuer or bank due to going over your credit limit or having insufficient funds in your account, your card issuer or bank may charge you a fee, and you alone are responsible for that fee.
5. Service Credits. We may allow you to prepay for certain services through the purchase of credits ("Service Credits" or "Advertiser Balance"). Such credits represent the amount that you have paid in advance for use of the services. Additional terms may apply to the services. Service Credits are only for business or commercial purposes.
    
    Service Credits are not legal tender or currency; are not redeemable, refundable (except where required by law, or otherwise stated in our terms) or exchangeable for any sum of money or monetary value; have no equivalent value in fiat currency; do not act as a substitute for fiat currency; and do not constitute or confer upon you any personal property right. Meta is not an operator of a digital wallet or a stored value facility, and is not an issuer of e-money. Meta is not a bank and does not offer banking services; accordingly, Service Credits do not earn interest, are not deposit obligations and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, or any other entity or insurance or deposit protection scheme, whether governmental or private.
    
6. Facebook Gift Card Balances. Facebook gift cards may be used to generate a gift card balance ("Gift Card Balance") through the Meta Products. You can then use this Gift Card Balance on our platform as a payment method. The following terms apply to Gift Card Balances:
    1. If you enter the gift card's PIN and click "Redeem" at [www.facebook.com/giftcards/redeem](https://www.facebook.com/giftcards/redeem), we will credit the gift card's value to your Gift Card Balance. Once you have entered the PIN on your gift card, the value you received can't be restored to the original gift card.
    2. All gift cards converted at [www.facebook.com/giftcards/redeem](https://www.facebook.com/giftcards/redeem) as described above will result in Gift Card Balances that can be used exclusively to make payments to developers on the platform; your Gift Card Balance will be applied towards funding transactions that you wish to complete and if your Gift Card Balance is insufficient to complete a transaction, we will ask you to elect an additional payment method to cover the difference. Gift cards converted in certain games, however, may result in value that can only be used within that game, or in other games from the same developer.
    3. We are not a bank, so Gift Card Balances are not deposits and they do not earn interest. Gift Card Balances are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme or any other entity or insurance scheme, whether governmental or private.
    4. We may change the process to convert gift cards into Gift Card Balances, or the ways that you can use your resulting Gift Card Balance, at any time as we deem necessary without prior notice to the full extent permitted by law.
    5. Some Facebook gift cards have bonus offers. Bonus offers are open to customers who redeem a participating Facebook gift card during the offer period stated on the gift card packaging. To obtain the bonus item, visit [www.facebook.com/giftcards/redeem](https://www.facebook.com/giftcards/redeem), enter the gift card PIN when prompted and follow the instructions to receive your item. We will not give notice of the expiry of these bonus offers. Free gift items may vary; average retail value of items will range from approximately one to fifteen USD ($1-15). Bonus offers may not be combined with other offers and discounts, nor exchanged, nor redeemed for cash. Other Terms and Conditions may apply to the use of Facebook Gift Cards and of [www.facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/); see site for details.
    6. You may not sell your Gift Card Balance or any portion thereof, nor transfer any portion thereof to anyone outside of the Meta Products.
    7. Gift Card Balances are not redeemable for any sum of money or monetary value from us unless required by law.
    8. Facebook gift cards and Gift Card Balances don't expire. However, Gift Card Balances are subject to our Abandoned Property provision (see Clause III, Section 6, below).
7. Incompatibility. You may at some point encounter an app or feature that does not support the payment method you would prefer to use; however, you can select a different type of payment instrument (such as credit or debit card, or mobile operator billing).
8. Mobile billing. Mobile network billing is another payment method that we have made available for your convenience. If you use mobile billing as a payment credential, you consent to the following applicable risks and other terms:
    1. By choosing the mobile billing payment method, you agree that we and your mobile operator may exchange information about you in order to facilitate completion or reversal of payments, resolution of disputes, provision of customer support or other billing-related activity.
    2. You are responsible for any charges, fees, changes to your mobile plan service or billing, alterations to your mobile device or any other consequence that may arise out of your use of mobile billing.
    3. If you use mobile billing, you are bound not only by these Payments Terms, but also by the Terms and Conditions of your mobile operator.
    4. If you have any questions about any charges or fees that appear on your mobile phone bill, you may contact your mobile provider's customer service division.
    5. Sometimes, use of mobile billing may lead to charges that, for various technical reasons beyond our control, cannot be refunded to you. In these cases, we have the right, but not the obligation, to issue you a courtesy credit.
9. Boleto (prepaid). If you use Boleto as a payment method, you consent to the following applicable risks and other terms:
    1. Refunds. **Due to technical limitations, we are ONLY able to provide refunds by making a bank transfer into a bank account**. If you make a purchase with Boleto and later request a refund for any reason, **you MUST have a bank account in order to receive the refund**. Bank account information provided when requesting a refund should be the same information as on the ad account. Click [here](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/261457568615847) for more information about the refund process.
    2. Safety. We may delay or limit the availability of your purchase, for either safety reasons or to make sure that we possess all relevant information necessary to process the payment and deliver to you what you have paid for.
    3. Information. You agree and consent that we will store your tax ID (CNPJ/CPF). We may use your tax ID to obtain additional information about you, necessary to process the payment, from the federal tax ID registration database provided by the Brazilian government, via a third-party processor. We will also submit final tax documents to the Brazilian government as required.
10. If you are an Advertiser in India (as defined in the Country-specific Ads Terms) placing an Order (as defined in the Self-serve Ad Terms) using a no-cost equated monthly instalment payment option for payments made by you to Meta to add to your Service Credits, you hereby consent to the specific terms applicable to this payment option: [No-cost EMI terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/no_cost_emi).
11. If you are an advertising agency in Brazil, you cannot use any credit line issued by us to an advertiser to advertise on behalf or interest of any third party. Credit lines issued to advertising agencies can only be used directly by the advertising agency for the advertising agency's own benefit or interest.

**III. Actions we may take**

1. At-will use. (a) We may revoke your eligibility to make payments through the Meta Products at any time at our sole discretion. (b) For consumers and small businesses in Australia, we may revoke your eligibility to make payments through Meta Products at any time, acting reasonably, including if (i) you have materially breached these Payment Terms; (ii) we are required by law or a regulatory authority to do so; or (iii) if it is reasonably necessary to protect our legitimate interests.
2. Enquiries. By using payments features through the Meta Products, you acknowledge and agree that we may make any enquiries that we consider necessary, either directly or through third parties, concerning your identity and creditworthiness.
3. Our right to cancel. We may cancel any transaction if we believe that the transaction violates these Payments Terms or the [Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms), or if we believe that doing so may prevent financial loss. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may also cancel any Gift Card Balance or Service Credits accumulated, transferred, assigned or sold in connection with any fraudulent or illegal behaviour or breach of applicable terms.
4. Payment limitations. In order to prevent financial loss to you or to us, we may place a delay on a payment for a period of time, limit payment instruments for a transaction, limit your ability to make a payment or deactivate your account.
5. Sharing of information. In order to prevent financial loss to you or to us, we may contact your payment instrument issuer, law enforcement or affected third parties (including other users) and share details of any payments that you are associated with, if we believe that doing so may prevent financial loss or a violation of law and/or our policies. As further detailed in the applicable privacy policy, we also share information with third parties such as payment service providers, including information required to complete your transaction, such as order, payment, contact and delivery information.
6. Abandoned property. If you leave a Gift Card Balance unused for the period of time set forth by applicable laws for unclaimed property, or if you delete your account and you did not breach applicable terms or policies, and leave a Gift Card Balance, or if we deactivate your account for reasons other than for your breach of the applicable terms or policies, and you do not meet any conditions necessary to reinstate it within six (6) months, we may process your Gift Card Balance in accordance with our legal obligations, including by submitting funds associated with your Gift Card Balance to the appropriate governing body as required by law.
7. Suspension/forfeiture of Service Credits. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account if you are in breach of applicable terms or policies, and, where required by law, you do not meet all the conditions necessary to reinstate your account within six (6) months. Furthermore, we may also retain your unused Service Credits and any prepayment, which shall be forfeited, to the extent permitted by law. Such an amount is a fair, reasonable estimate and is not a penalty.

**IV. Disputes and reversals**

1. Customer assistance. Subject to Sections 2, 3, 4 and 5 below, we provide various tools in our [Support Centre](https://www.facebook.com/facebookpaysupport) to assist you in communicating with a third party to resolve a dispute arising from a payment transaction.
2. No liability for underlying transaction. If you enter into a transaction with a third party and have a dispute over the goods or services that you purchased or over the donation you made, we have no liability for the goods or services underlying the transaction or for how the third party used your donation. Our only responsibility is to handle your payment transaction. All payments are final unless otherwise required by law. If you order something that becomes unavailable before it can be provided to you, you may request a refund of your payment.
3. Fraud warning. Use of Meta Payments to perform fraudulent activities or transactions may result in the loss of funds with no recourse. See Clause VI below for the state-specific fraud notices.
4. Duty to notify us. (a) If you believe that an unauthorised or otherwise problematic transaction has taken place under your account, you agree to notify us immediately, so that we may take action to prevent financial loss. Unless you submit the claim to us within 30 days after the charge, you will have waived, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all claims against us arising out of or otherwise related to the transaction. (b) For consumers and small businesses in Australia, if you believe that an unauthorised or otherwise problematic transaction has taken place under your account, you agree to notify us immediately, so that we may take action to prevent financial loss.
5. Intervention. We may intervene in disputes concerning payments that may arise between you and a developer or a merchant, but we have no obligation to do so.
6. Technical difficulties. If you experience a technical failure or interruption of service that causes your payment to fail, you may request that your transaction be completed at a later time.

**V. Notices and amendments to these Payments Terms**

1. Notice to you. By using payments features through the Meta Products, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically any important information regarding your payments or your account. We may also provide notices to you by posting them on our website, sending them to you through an in-app notification or by sending them to an email address or street address that you previously provided to us. All notices shall be considered received by you within 24 hours of the time posted or sent; notices by posted shall be considered received within three (3) working days of the time sent.
2. Notice to us. Except as otherwise stated, you must send notices to us relating to payments through the Meta Products and these Payments Terms by post to: Meta, Attn: Legal Department, 1 Meta Way, Menlo Park, California, 94025, US.
3. Amendment guidelines. We may update these Payments Terms at any time without notice as we deem necessary to the full extent permitted by law. The Payments Terms in place at the time that you confirm a transaction will govern that transaction.
