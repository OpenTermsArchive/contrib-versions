Dune AI
-------

Dune also provides LLM Chatbot services related to the information, answers and other texts (“Outputs”) to the User’s requests (“Inputs”) by leveraging third party’s artificial intelligence services based on large language models. Inputs are also User Content.

The LLM Chatbot Services share the User’s Inputs to third party artificial intelligence service providers to receive Outputs.

Outputs may not be unique across users and the Services may generate the same or similar output for different users. Given the probabilistic nature of machine learning, the Outputs may in some situations result in incorrect information that does not accurately reflect facts or data. The User should evaluate and confirm with other sources the accuracy of any Output.

The LLM Chatbot Services are offered through different modules and integrations with specific applications or websites, as may be made available by Dune from time to time. The User hereby acknowledges and agrees that Dune will share Inputs with third party service providers that provide large language models artificial intelligence services. Dune may change such service providers from time to time.

The User is responsible and liable for the information it shares through an Input, including, but not limited to, potential confidential or private information and personal data.

User Representations
--------------------

You represent, covenant, and warrant that (i) you will use the Site and Service only in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and in a way that will not harm the Service or anyone else’s use of it; (ii) the information you provide us is true, accurate, and complete, as you are solely responsible for such information; and (iii) your use of the Site or Services do not violate any agreements with any third parties.

All User Content posted on the Service must comply with applicable laws, including, but not limited to, copyright and data privacy laws. You agree that any User Content you post does not and will not violate any law or infringe any rights of any third party.

You understand and acknowledge that Dune may delete any User Content in the case Dune received a notification of a third-party alleging any illegality, including privacy rights, copyrights, or other intellectual property infringement.

You further represent, covenant, and warrant that you will not (i) try to reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, extract, or decipher the Services or software making up the Services, (ii) navigate or search the Services with any tool, software, agent, engine or other means (including bots, avatars, intelligent agents, or spiders), (iii) use a mean other than Dune’s provided interface to access the Services, (iv) use the Services in a way that could impair, overburden, damage, or disable any portion of the Services, or (v) copy or mirror any material contained on the Site or the Services (unless as allowed herein).

Change of Subscription Plan
---------------------------

Users may change their Team’s Subscription Plan online in the Team account under “Settings” on the Site.

If you _upgrade_ your Team’s Subscription Plan, you and other Team members will be allowed to start using the additional features applicable to the new plan immediately. If you upgrade from another paid subscription, you will be charged the price of the new Subscription Plan pro-rated to the number of days left in your previous subscription’s period.

If you _downgrade_ your Plan, you will continue to have access to the features of the previously acquired Subscription Plan until the end of the then current subscription period. You will be charged the amount associated with the new Subscription Plan and have access only to the features of the new Subscription Plan at the end the relevant subscription period.

Users on Custom Subscription Plans will need to contact their account manager in order to downgrade or terminate their subscription as this is not possible to do in the application.

Termination of Subscription
---------------------------

You may terminate the subscription for the Service at any time. You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. Any prepaid amounts will not be refunded. At the end of the subscription period, you will be charged any extra execution amounts applicable to your Subscription Plan.

You will have access to the Service for the remaining period corresponding to the prepaid amount.

Deletion of data
----------------

Upon termination of a Subscription Plan the User’s data (including, but not limited, to User Information and User Content) may be deleted without prior notice. The User must therefore export any data it wishes to retain prior to the end of the Subscription period. For additional info, see our [Privacy Policy](https://dune.com/privacy).

However, data uploaded through the Data Hub Services may be kept on Dune, at Dune’s sole discretion, under the terms of the license granted by the User in the Duna Data Hub Services Addendum.

Deletion of your account
------------------------

You may delete your account at any time. The deletion of your User account will not release you from any obligations incurred in accordance with your Subscription Plan or by breach of these Terms of Service. Please note that references to your username might still remain visible on the Service unless you remove it from third party sources, such as your Github account linked to the Dune account.

Data uploaded through the Data Hub Services may be kept on Dune, at Dune’s sole discretion, under the terms of the license granted by the User in the Duna Data Hub Services Addendum even after the deletion of the account.

Prices and payment terms
------------------------

The subscription fee as further described in this section 14 (“Subscription Fee”) varies according to the Subscription Plan. Usage in excess of the agreed quotas for Credits (as defined below), Executions and/or Data Points under any Subscription Plan (overage) will be payable in arrears.

The Subscription Fee is exclusive of all direct and indirect taxes, charges, fees, and duties, including but not limited to any VAT or withholding tax. The User will bear any tax costs, including, notably, VAT and any applicable local withholding taxes.

The Subscription Fee is subject to change upon thirty (30) days’ notice from us. Such notice may be provided at any time through the Dune website, the Service, or by email. Your continued use of Dune after receiving this notice will be understood as your acceptance of the new Subscription Fee.

There are no refunds or credits for termination of your account before the end of any prepaid service period.

Dune reserves the right to suspend the Services in the case of non-payment of the Subscription Plan’s consideration.

#### Credits

“Credits” are how we denominate paid usage at Dune. Credits allow you to flexibly decide how to use Dune’s most key functionalities, so you can freely choose how to trade off query Executions with Execution performance and SQL API data export volumes. The number of Credits ascribed to each Subscription Plan is described in the Subscription Tiers and Pricing Addendum.

  

Payment Method
--------------

If you choose a paid Subscription Plan, Dune will require you to pay with credit or debit cards. Card payments are processed via a third-party service provider, Stripe Inc. (“Stripe”). Stripe is licensed to provide these payment services and complies with the relevant laws and regulations. All payments for the Services are subject to the Stripe [terms and conditions](https://stripe.com/en-nl/legal), which may be amended by Stripe from time to time.

All card data is stored by Stripe. Dune does not store any card data. The User may delete a stored card in the User’s profile on the Site. Dune shares with Stripe User Information other than card data, as Stripe does not store any other User information.

The User authorizes Stripe to process card payments for the Services on the User’s behalf. The payment amount will be equal to the total pricing of the User’s order.

In the case the debit or credit card is rejected, the User may update the payment information. Payment must go through for the order to be submitted and processed.

Intellectual Property Rights
----------------------------

Dune retains all rights to all elements of the Service. This includes, but is not limited to, the rights and ownership to algorithms, source code, object code and accompanying documentation, user interface design, graphics, illustrations, data, drawings, images, concepts, techniques, and specifications, design, trademarks, know-how, trade secrets, copyrights, and all other intellectual property rights.

Marketing
---------

The User agrees that Dune may list and/or identify a User’s name (including by displaying User’s trademark) to identify the business relationship between the parties on Dune’s website and in other marketing and advertising collateral.

Limitation of Executions
------------------------

The default number of Executions a User or Team is entitled to perform is defined in each Subscription Plan. For the purposes of these Terms of Service, an “Execution” is defined as a request for data or information from Dune’s database originated from either the Dune Application Service or the SQL API Service. Dune may suspend or block the User if Dune believes, at its sole discretion, that the User is abusing the limitation of Executions.

Teams
-----

The Teams Service allows Users to collaborate on Dune.

Administrative Users (“Admins”) shall be liable for choosing the Subscription Plan and making the payments. Admins on a Team will have full responsibility to determine level of access for the Users on a Team and that User Content is managed by the right Users with the right level of access. All Users on a Team shall ensure compliance with the Terms of Service by themselves and the other Users in the Teams.

Admins shall have the following powers:

1. create one or more Teams, including editing its public Profile;
2. invite other Users to collaborate on the team, exclude Users from the Team, and dissolve the Team;
3. to define different privileges (Viewer, Editor, Admin) for each User with access to the Team; and
4. transfer content out of the Team

Free access for Community Users
-------------------------------

Dune may offer free access to the Services for community Users and Teams (hereinafter "Community Users"). Community Users are Users or Teams that are not subscribed to a paid Subscription Plan.

The Service is hosted on an infrastructure delivered by a third-party cloud service provider. As a Community User you recognize that you may only use the Service in a way that does not substantially affect the capacity of the infrastructure and/or the performance of the Service. Dune sets the limit for when use of the Service is deemed to substantially affect the capacity of the infrastructure, at its sole discretion.

Community Users may not create multiple Teams in order to circumvent the need to upgrade to a paid Subscription Plan or enter Credit overage. Dune determines, at its sole discretion, if a User abuses the Service by creating multiple Teams.

Suspension and Termination of Services
--------------------------------------

Dune reserves the right to at any time determine whether a use of the Service is in violation of its requirements for acceptable use and suspend, revoke, limit or terminate your and/or your Teams’ access to any of the Services if Dune, at its sole discretion, suspects or concludes that the Services provided by Dune are being used in violation of these Terms of Service by you or your Team. Dune will take reasonable steps to notify you of the suspension or removal of your User account or Team account, providing you with the reason for termination as well as your options for redress. Notice is, however, dependent on you having provided Dune with the electronic means to contact you.

------------------

Dune is entitled to transfer its rights and obligation pursuant to these Terms of Service to a third party as part of a merger or acquisition process, or as a result of other organizational changes.
