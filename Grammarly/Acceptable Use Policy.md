Additionally, if you are blocked by Grammarly from accessing our services (for example, by blocking your IP address), you may not circumvent or attempt to circumvent such blocking (for example, by masking your IP address or using a proxy IP address).  
    
* Interfere or attempt to interfere with service to any user, host, or network, including, without limitation, by means of submitting malicious software or computer code, load testing, overloading, “flooding,” “spamming,” “mail bombing,” or “crashing.”
