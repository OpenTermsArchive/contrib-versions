Grammarly Customer Business Agreement
-------------------------------------

([Previous Version](https://www.grammarly.com/terms-2022))  
  
_We have updated our online terms. If you are a Grammarly Business or Grammarly for Education customer that signed an Order prior to December 1, 2022, the version of the terms that were in effect at that time govern your organization’s use of Grammarly._   
  
_Also, if your organization signed an offline agreement with us, then that agreement governs your organization’s use of our services._  
  
This Grammarly Customer Business Agreement governs your organization’s use of the Services. “**Us**”, “**our**”, and “**we**” refers to Grammarly, Inc. and “**Customer**” or “**you**” refers to the organization governed by these terms. By clicking "I agree" or “Purchase” (or a button or link with a similar meaning), signing your Order, or using the Services, you are agreeing to this agreement on behalf of your organization.  
  
If a Customer's Order contains additional terms and conditions, then those terms override these terms to the extent they conflict.   

1\. Provision of the Services to Customer
-----------------------------------------

1.1 Right to Use the Services and Software. During the Subscription Term, (a) we will provide the Services to Customer, (b) we grant Customer the right to use the Services subject to this agreement, and (c) we grant Customer the right to install and use any software provided by us to access the Services in accordance with the Documentation, all subject to the terms of this agreement.  
  
1.2 Restrictions on the Right to Use the Services. Customer may only use the Services (a) for its internal business purposes and (b) in accordance with this agreement and the Acceptable Use Policy.  
  
1.3 Access for End Users; Responsibility for End Users. Customer may assign End Users to use the Services. End Users may be employees or contractors of Customer or its Affiliates who are using the Services solely for the benefit of Customer or its Affiliates. Customer will obtain and maintain from End Users any consents necessary to allow us to deliver the Services. End User accounts may only be used by a single End User, and may not be shared by multiple individuals.  
  
1.4 Service-Specific Terms. To the extent there are any Service-Specific Terms applicable to Customer’s use of the Services, those are incorporated by reference into this agreement.  
  
1.5 Changes to the Services. We may make changes to features and functionality of the Services during the Subscription Term. If we make a change to the Services that has a material adverse effect on the functionality of the Services, taken as a whole, we will notify Customer in advance.   
  
1.6 No Liability for Third-Party Platforms. Customer’s use of a Third-Party Platform with the Services is governed by Customer’s agreement with the provider of the Third-Party Platform, not this agreement, and we are not responsible for Third-Party Platforms.  

2\. Payment Terms
-----------------

2.1 Fees. Customer will pay the fees for the Services (“**Fees**”) described in the Order, in US dollars (unless otherwise specified in the Order). All Fees are non-refundable except as required by law or expressly set out in this agreement.  
  
2.2 Payment Timing. The payment timing is described in Customer's Order. If the payment timing is not specified in Customer’s Order, Customer will pay all Fees within thirty days of when Customer receives an invoice. Late payments are subject to a service charge of the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum amount allowed by law.   
  
2.3 Taxes.If there are any government-imposed sales, value-added, delivery, withholding, or similar taxes associated with your purchase of the Services (but not taxes based on our net income, net worth, asset value, property value, or employment), you will pay such taxes.   
  
2.4 Notice of Fee Changes Prior to Renewal; Notice of Corrections. In the event we change Customer's Fees, we will give Customer at least thirty days’ notice of that change prior to the renewal of Customer's then-current subscription. If Customer believes we have incorrectly billed Customer, Customer has sixty days from receipt of an invoice to notify us of the error.  
  
2.5 Cancellations. You may cancel your subscription and that cancellation will take effect at the end of the then-current subscription (for example, if you are on a paid monthly subscription, the cancellation will take effect the following month, but if you are on a paid yearly subscription, the cancellation will take effect the following year).  

3\. Protection of Customer Data
-------------------------------

3.1 Security. We maintain industry-standard security and privacy certification, such as a SOC II certification. We will use appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to prevent unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure of Customer Data and System Data.   
  
3.2 Data Privacy and Data Privacy Addendum. The terms of the Grammarly Data Privacy Addendum located at [https://www.grammarly.com/online-dpa](https://www.grammarly.com/online-dpa) are incorporated by reference into this agreement. We may update the Data Privacy Addendum to comply with any changes in data protection laws and regulations, or when otherwise commercially reasonable, by posting a new version on our website.   
  
3.3 Data Retention. Upon termination or expiration of this agreement, Grammarly will, at the choice and written request of Customer, delete any Customer Data in its possession within a commercially reasonable time, unless we’re required by law to retain it. We may make instructions available to Customer regarding how to submit such a request. Customer is responsible for following these instructions to request the deletion of Customer Data.  
  
3.4 HIPAA Data. Customer agrees not to submit to the Services any HIPAA Data unless Customer has entered into a BAA with us. Unless a BAA is in place, we will have no liability under this agreement for HIPAA Data, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement or in HIPAA or any similar federal or state laws, rules, or regulations. Upon mutual execution of a BAA, the BAA will be incorporated by reference into this agreement.  

4\. Confidentiality
-------------------

4.1 Restrictions on Use and Disclosure of Confidential Information. The recipient of Confidential Information will only use the disclosing party's Confidential Information to exercise its rights and fulfill its obligations under this agreement, and will use reasonable care to protect against the disclosure of the disclosing party's Confidential Information. The recipient may disclose Confidential Information only to its Affiliates, employees, agents, or professional advisors who need to know it and who have agreed in writing (or in the case of professional advisors are otherwise bound) to keep it confidential. The recipient will ensure that those people and entities use the received Confidential Information only to exercise rights and fulfill obligations under this agreement.  
  
4.2 Required Disclosure. The recipient may disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by applicable Legal Process if the recipient uses commercially reasonable efforts to (a) promptly notify the other party of such disclosure before disclosing, and (b) comply with the other party's reasonable requests regarding its efforts to oppose the disclosure, in each case, if doing so is consistent with the Legal Process and doesn’t obstruct a governmental investigation.  

5\. Intellectual Property Rights

5.1 Reservation of Intellectual Property Rights. As between the parties, Customer owns all Intellectual Property Rights in Customer Data, and we own all Intellectual Property Rights in the Services and in System Data.

5.4 Feedback. If Customer or its End Users provide us with feedback about any of our products or services (including the Services), we may use that feedback without restriction or obligation to Customer, and Customer hereby assigns all rights, title, and interest in such feedback to us.   
  
5.5 Customer Reference. We may use Customer's name, logo, and marks to identify Customer as our customer on our website and in other marketing materials and activities, subject to any brand guidelines provided by Customer to us in writing.

Customer may choose to use these beta services in its sole discretion. We may not support these beta services, we may change them at any time, and they may not be as secure or reliable as our other Services. Customer will treat the beta services and any related documentation as Confidential Information until we officially launch the beta services. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, we will have no liability arising out of or in connection with these beta services.   

9\. Limitation of Liability

9.1 Limitation on Liability Amount. Subject to _Section 9.3_ (_Unlimited Liabilities_), each party's total aggregate Liability arising out of or relating to this agreement is limited to the Fees Customer paid during the twelve-month period before the event giving rise to Liability (unless that amount is zero due to Customer participating in a free trial, in which case Grammarly’s total liability will not exceed one hundred dollars).  
  
9.2 Limitation on Indirect Liabilities.To the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to _Section 9.3 (Unlimited Liabilities)_, neither party will have any Liability arising out of or relating to this agreement for any (a) indirect, consequential, special, incidental, or punitive damages or (b) lost revenues, cost of replacement services, profits, savings, or goodwill.

(b) its indemnification obligations under _Section 10 (Indemnification)_;  
(c) its infringement of the other party's Intellectual Property Rights;  
(d) its payment obligations under this agreement; or  
(e) matters for which liability cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.  

10\. Indemnification
--------------------

10.1 Our Indemnification Obligations to Customer. We will defend and indemnify Customer against settlement amounts as well as damages and costs finally awarded in any third-party legal proceeding (“**Indemnified Amounts**”) to the extent arising from an allegation that Customer's use of our technology used to provide the Services infringes the third party's Intellectual Property Rights.  
  
10.2 Customer's Indemnification Obligations to Us. Customer will defend and indemnify us against Indemnified Amounts in any third-party legal proceeding to the extent arising from (a) Customer Data or (b) Customer's and Customer's End Users’ use of the Services.  
  
10.3 Indemnification Exclusions. These indemnification obligations will not apply to the extent the underlying allegation arises from (a) the indemnified party's breach of this agreement or (b) a combination of the indemnifying party's technology with materials not provided by the indemnifying party under this agreement, unless such combination is required by this agreement.  
  
10.4 Notice Requirement.The indemnified party must promptly notify the indemnifying party in writing of any allegation(s) that preceded the third-party legal proceeding and cooperate reasonably with the indemnifying party to resolve the allegation(s) and third-party legal proceeding. If breach of this notification obligation prejudices the defense of the legal proceeding, the indemnifying party's obligations will be reduced in proportion to the prejudice.  
  
10.5 Sole Control Requirement. The indemnified party must give sole control of the indemnified portion of the third-party legal proceeding to the indemnifying party, subject to the following: (a) the indemnified party may appoint its own non-controlling counsel, at its own expense; and (b) any settlement requiring the indemnified party to admit liability, pay money, or take (or refrain from taking) any action, will require the indemnified party's prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.  
  
10.6 Remedies. If we reasonably believe the Services might infringe a third party's Intellectual Property Rights, then we may, at our sole option and expense (a) procure the right for Customer to continue using the Services; (b) modify the Services to make them non-infringing without materially reducing their functionality; or (c) replace the Services with a non-infringing, functionally equivalent alternative. If we can’t figure out a reasonable way to offer these remedies, we may suspend or terminate Customer's use of the Services, with a pro-rata refund of prepaid and unused Fees for the Services.  
  
10.7 Indemnification is the Sole Remedy for Third-Party Intellectual Property Rights Allegations. Without affecting either party's termination rights, this _Section 10 (Indemnification)_ states the parties' sole and exclusive remedy under this agreement for any third-party allegations of Intellectual Property Rights infringement covered by this _Section 10 (Indemnification)_.
