([Previous Version](https://www.grammarly.com/terms/customer-business-agreement-nov-2024))  
  
_Note: This Grammarly Customer Business Agreement applies to organizations using Grammarly for a business purpose, including Grammarly Business or Grammarly for Education. If your organization signed an offline agreement with us, then that agreement governs your organization’s use of our Services._  
  
This Grammarly Customer Business Agreement ("**Agreement"**) is made between Grammarly, Inc. ("**Grammarly**") and the organization, business, or other legal entity that has entered into an Order for Grammarly's services that references this Agreement ("**Customer**"). Grammarly and Customer may individually be referred to as a “**Party**” and collectively “**the Parties**.”  This Agreement will govern Customer’s access and use of the Services and is effective as of the earliest date that Customer accesses the Services or executes an Order that references this Agreement (the “**Effective Date**”).  

1\. Provision and Use of the Services
-------------------------------------

1.1 Right to Use the Services. During the Subscription Term and subject to the terms of this Agreement and the applicable Order, Grammarly grants Customer the right to access and use the Services solely for Customer’s internal business purposes in accordance with the Documentation.  
  
1.2 Use by Affiliates. Customer, at its sole discretion, may permit its Affiliates to access and use any Services purchased by Customer under an Order, provided that such Affiliate access and use the Services in compliance with all of the obligations imposed upon Customer under this Agreement (other than payment obligations), and (ii) Customer remains responsible for the acts and omissions of such Affiliates. If a Customer Affiliate and Grammarly execute a separate Order (an “**Affiliate Order**”), such Affiliate and Grammarly are deemed (a) to have entered into a separate customer business agreement containing the terms of this Agreement with any reference to “Customer” meaning only such Affiliate (“**Affiliate Agreement**”) and (b) that Affiliate Order shall be governed by the Affiliate Agreement. Customer is not permitted to resell access to the Services to any of its Affiliates without the prior written consent of Grammarly.  
  
1.3 Access for End Users; Responsibility for End Users. Customer may create End User accounts for the Services, in the numbers and types stated in the applicable Order. Each End User account must be designated for use by one individual only. However, ​​an End User account can be transferred to a new individual if the individual previously associated with the account no longer requires access to the Services. Customer is responsible for ensuring End Users’ compliance with this Agreement and the security of End Users’ log-in credentials. Customer must promptly notify Grammarly if it becomes aware of any unauthorized access to any End User’s login credentials or other unauthorized access to or use of the Services. Customer is responsible for providing all legally required notices and obtaining all consents necessary to allow Grammarly to provide the Services to End Users.  
  
1.4 Changes to the Services.  Customer acknowledges that the Services are evolving and that Grammarly may modify the features and functionality of the Services during the Subscription Term. Grammarly will not materially decrease the overall functionality of the Services purchased by Customer during the Subscription Term.   
  
1.5 Purchase Through Reseller. If Customer subscribes to Services from an authorized Grammarly reseller or partner (“**Reseller**”), and notwithstanding anything set forth in this Agreement: (a) the terms of this Agreement will act as the end user license agreement, and in addition to Customer’s compliance with the Agreement, Customer’s right to access and use such Services is subject to the terms and conditions of Customer’s written agreement with the Reseller (“**Reseller Agreement**”), including Customer’s obligation to timely pay Fees to the Reseller; (b) Customer will execute all Orders directly with the Reseller and not Grammarly; and (c) the terms and conditions of Section 2 (_Payment Terms_) do not apply. Any refund, payments, or credits which Grammarly must provide to Customer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement will be provided by Grammarly to Reseller, and Customer acknowledges that it must seek such refunds, payments, and credits from Reseller only. Furthermore, Customer’s right to terminate or cancel its Service is solely as described in the Reseller Agreement, provided that nothing herein shall be interpreted as permitting Reseller to offer terms inconsistent with the remainder of this Agreement. If the Reseller ceases at any time to be an authorized Reseller, including for a failure to pay for any Services, Customer’s continued use of Services may be conditioned upon Customer executing a written agreement for such Services directly with Grammarly, and paying the outstanding Fees, if any, that Reseller did not remit to Grammarly on Customer’s behalf. Resellers are not authorized to modify the Agreement or make any promises or commitments on Grammarly’s behalf, and Grammarly is not bound by any obligations to Customer other than as set forth in this Agreement. Grammarly may temporarily suspend or terminate delivery of Services to Customer upon notice at the written direction of Reseller to the extent permitted under this Agreement or the Reseller Agreement.

Customer is responsible for ensuring that the features and capabilities of the Customer’s Third-Party Subscription allow Customer to access and use the Coda Pack.

All payment-related matters, including fee payment, renewal, and refund policies, are between the Customer and the Third-Party Pack provider and are governed by the Third-Party Terms.  
  
1.6.5 Third-Party Data Flow. Customer is under no obligation to use any Coda Packs or Third-Party Services.  However, by downloading, installing, enabling, or using a Coda Pack or a Third-Party Service, Customer authorizes Grammarly to provide, use, process, and transmit Customer Data, System Data, and Account Information to (a) the Third-Party Service that interoperates with Grammarly’s Service; and (b) the Third-Party Service’s developer, if different from Grammarly, in accordance with the Third-Party Terms.

1.7 Beta Services. Grammarly may occasionally provide Customer access to new service offerings still in development (“**Beta Services**”). Grammarly will clearly designate all Beta Services as “alpha,” “beta,” “early access,” or something similar in the applicable Services or Documentation. Customer may choose to use these Beta Services at its sole discretion. Customer will treat the Beta Services and any related documentation as Grammarly’s Confidential Information until Grammarly makes such information publicly available on its website. Customer acknowledges that Grammarly is under no obligation to support these Beta Services, and Beta Services may not be as secure or reliable as Grammarly's other Services. In Grammarly’s sole discretion, Grammarly may change the functionality of the Beta Services and/or discontinue, suspend, or remove Customer’s access to such Beta Services (including any Customer Data stored or processed within the Beta Services) and has no obligation to make them generally available. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE IN THIS AGREEMENT, GRAMMARLY WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH BETA SERVICES.
