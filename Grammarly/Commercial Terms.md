-------------------------------------

([Previous Version](https://www.grammarly.com/terms/customer-business-agreement-nov-2024))  
  
_Note: This Grammarly Customer Business Agreement applies to organizations using Grammarly for a business purpose, including Grammarly Business or Grammarly for Education. If your organization signed an offline agreement with us, then that agreement governs your organization’s use of our Services._  
  
This Grammarly Customer Business Agreement ("**Agreement"**) is made between Grammarly, Inc. ("**Grammarly**") and the organization, business, or other legal entity that has entered into an Order for Grammarly's services that references this Agreement ("**Customer**"). Grammarly and Customer may individually be referred to as a “**Party**” and collectively “**the Parties**.”  This Agreement will govern Customer’s access and use of the Services and is effective as of the earliest date that Customer accesses the Services or executes an Order that references this Agreement (the “**Effective Date**”).  

1\. Provision and Use of the Services
-------------------------------------

1.1 Right to Use the Services. During the Subscription Term and subject to the terms of this Agreement and the applicable Order, Grammarly grants Customer the right to access and use the Services solely for Customer’s internal business purposes in accordance with the Documentation.  
  
1.2 Use by Affiliates. Customer, at its sole discretion, may permit its Affiliates to access and use any Services purchased by Customer under an Order, provided that such Affiliate access and use the Services in compliance with all of the obligations imposed upon Customer under this Agreement (other than payment obligations), and (ii) Customer remains responsible for the acts and omissions of such Affiliates. If a Customer Affiliate and Grammarly execute a separate Order (an “**Affiliate Order**”), such Affiliate and Grammarly are deemed (a) to have entered into a separate customer business agreement containing the terms of this Agreement with any reference to “Customer” meaning only such Affiliate (“**Affiliate Agreement**”) and (b) that Affiliate Order shall be governed by the Affiliate Agreement. Customer is not permitted to resell access to the Services to any of its Affiliates without the prior written consent of Grammarly.  
  
1.3 Access for End Users; Responsibility for End Users. Customer may create End User accounts for the Services, in the numbers and types stated in the applicable Order. Each End User account must be designated for use by one individual only. However, ​​an End User account can be transferred to a new individual if the individual previously associated with the account no longer requires access to the Services. Customer is responsible for ensuring End Users’ compliance with this Agreement and the security of End Users’ log-in credentials. Customer must promptly notify Grammarly if it becomes aware of any unauthorized access to any End User’s login credentials or other unauthorized access to or use of the Services. Customer is responsible for providing all legally required notices and obtaining all consents necessary to allow Grammarly to provide the Services to End Users.  
  
1.4 Changes to the Services.  Customer acknowledges that the Services are evolving and that Grammarly may modify the features and functionality of the Services during the Subscription Term. Grammarly will not materially decrease the overall functionality of the Services purchased by Customer during the Subscription Term.   
  
1.5 Purchase Through Reseller. If Customer subscribes to Services from an authorized Grammarly reseller or partner (“**Reseller**”), and notwithstanding anything set forth in this Agreement: (a) the terms of this Agreement will act as the end user license agreement, and in addition to Customer’s compliance with the Agreement, Customer’s right to access and use such Services is subject to the terms and conditions of Customer’s written agreement with the Reseller (“**Reseller Agreement**”), including Customer’s obligation to timely pay Fees to the Reseller; (b) Customer will execute all Orders directly with the Reseller and not Grammarly; and (c) the terms and conditions of Section 2 (_Payment Terms_) do not apply. Any refund, payments, or credits which Grammarly must provide to Customer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement will be provided by Grammarly to Reseller, and Customer acknowledges that it must seek such refunds, payments, and credits from Reseller only. Furthermore, Customer’s right to terminate or cancel its Service is solely as described in the Reseller Agreement, provided that nothing herein shall be interpreted as permitting Reseller to offer terms inconsistent with the remainder of this Agreement. If the Reseller ceases at any time to be an authorized Reseller, including for a failure to pay for any Services, Customer’s continued use of Services may be conditioned upon Customer executing a written agreement for such Services directly with Grammarly, and paying the outstanding Fees, if any, that Reseller did not remit to Grammarly on Customer’s behalf. Resellers are not authorized to modify the Agreement or make any promises or commitments on Grammarly’s behalf, and Grammarly is not bound by any obligations to Customer other than as set forth in this Agreement. Grammarly may temporarily suspend or terminate delivery of Services to Customer upon notice at the written direction of Reseller to the extent permitted under this Agreement or the Reseller Agreement.  
  
1.6 Integrations.   
  
1.6.1 Customer-Built Integrations. Subject to this Agreement and any limitations set out in the Order, Customer may, at its discretion, access and use Grammarly’s developer tools to build extensions and integrations that interoperate with the Services (“**Customer Packs**”), which are governed by the  Grammarly Developer Terms found at [https://coda.io/trust/developer](https://coda.io/trust/developer) (“**Pack Developer Terms**”), and are incorporated herein by reference. To the extent there is a conflict between the Pack Developer Terms and this Agreement, the Pack Developer Terms will prevail.   
  
1.6.2 Grammarly-Developed Integrations. Subject to this Agreement and any limitations set out in the Order, Customer may, at its discretion, purchase additional Grammarly-developed integrations, plugins, or extensions to the Services that interoperate with third-party services (“**Coda Packs**”) as add-ons to its then-current subscription to the Services via the Coda Gallery or other such methods or venues as Grammarly may designate from time to time. Use of Coda Packs requires Customer to have (a) an active subscription to a Grammarly Service (e.g., Coda Docs) that supports Coda Packs; and (b) an active subscription to the third-party service that interoperates with the applicable Coda Pack (a “**Third-Party Subscription**”). Customer is responsible for ensuring that the features and capabilities of the Customer’s Third-Party Subscription allow Customer to access and use the Coda Pack. Grammarly will have no liability if Customer is required to purchase an additional or different Third-Party Subscription to utilize the Coda Packs. If Customer‘s Third-Party Subscription ends, Customer’s associated access and use of the Coda Pack will automatically terminate. Customer acknowledges it will not receive a refund of any fees prepaid for the Coda Pack in case of such termination. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, references to Services in this Agreement include Coda Packs.   
  
1.6.3 Third-Party Developed Integrations. Subject to this Agreement and any limitations set out in the Order, Customer may, at its discretion, purchase and use certain third-party developed and provided services, products, apps, integrations, code, plugins, content, or extensions that interoperate with the Services, including (a) third-party integrations made available via the Coda Gallery or other such methods or venues as Grammarly may designate from time to time (“**Third-Party Packs**”); (b) third-party service integrations made available through the Service dashboard or APIs; and (c) third-party products or services that Customer authorizes to access Customer’s Grammarly account using OAuth or other credentials (all of the foregoing, each and collectively, “**Third-Party Service(s)**”). Each Third-Party Service shall be exclusively governed by the terms of service, end user license agreement, privacy policies, and/or any other applicable terms and policies of the third-party provider as is agreed to between Customer and the third-party provider (“**Third-Party Terms**”).   
  
1.6.4 Payment for Third-Party Packs. Third-Party Packs may be offered free of charge or for a fee, either charged directly by the Third-Party Pack provider or by Grammarly. When Grammarly charges Customer on behalf of the Third-Party Pack provider, Customer acknowledges that Grammarly acts only as an intermediary in facilitating or collecting the applicable fees and taxes from Customer. All payment-related matters, including fee payment, renewal, and refund policies, are between the Customer and the Third-Party Pack provider and are governed by the Third-Party Terms.  
  
1.6.5 Third-Party Data Flow. Customer is under no obligation to use any Coda Packs or Third-Party Services.  However, by downloading, installing, enabling, or using a Coda Pack or a Third-Party Service, Customer authorizes Grammarly to provide, use, process, and transmit Customer Data, System Data, and Account Information to (a) the Third-Party Service that interoperates with Grammarly’s Service; and (b) the Third-Party Service’s developer, if different from Grammarly, in accordance with the Third-Party Terms.   
  
1.6.6 Third-Party Services Disclaimer. GRAMMARLY DOES NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR GUARANTEES REGARDING THIRD-PARTY SERVICES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THAT THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICES WILL FUNCTION PROPERLY WITH THE SERVICES. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES ARE MADE AVAILABLE BY GRAMMARLY ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. GRAMMARLY MAY CEASE PROVIDING ACCESS TO THEM AT ANY TIME, AND CEASING SUCH ACCESS WILL NOT ENTITLE CUSTOMER TO ANY REFUND, CREDIT, OR OTHER COMPENSATION FROM GRAMMARLY. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE IN THIS AGREEMENT, GRAMMARLY WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIRD-PARTY SERVICES.  
  
1.7 Beta Services. Grammarly may occasionally provide Customer access to new service offerings still in development (“**Beta Services**”). Grammarly will clearly designate all Beta Services as “alpha,” “beta,” “early access,” or something similar in the applicable Order or within the primary admin’s account settings. Customer may choose to use these Beta Services at its sole discretion. Customer will treat the Beta Services and any related documentation as Grammarly’s Confidential Information until Grammarly makes such information publicly available on its website. Customer acknowledges that Grammarly is under no obligation to support these Beta Services, and Beta Services may not be as secure or reliable as Grammarly's other Services. In Grammarly’s sole discretion, Grammarly may change the functionality of the Beta Services and/or discontinue, suspend, or remove Customer’s access to such Beta Services (including any Customer Data stored or processed within the Beta Services) and has no obligation to make them generally available. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE IN THIS AGREEMENT, GRAMMARLY WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH BETA SERVICES.  
  
1.8 Professional Services. From time to time, Customer may request that Grammarly provide professional services, including integration and/or customization services in connection with the Services (“**Professional Services**”). If the Parties agree to proceed with requested Professional Services, the Parties shall enter into a separate agreement that sets forth the specific terms and fees for such Professional Services.  

2\. Payment Terms
-----------------

2.1 Fees. Customer will pay the fees for the Services (“**Fees**”) described in the Order. Payment will be made in US dollars (unless another currency is specified in the Order). All payment obligations are non-cancellable, and Fees are non-refundable except as required by law or as expressly set out in this Agreement. Grammarly will send all invoices to the billing email address provided by Customer in the Order. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Grammarly, Grammarly will have no obligation to submit invoices to any vendor management portal or other similar system to obtain payment of the Fees.  
  
2.2 Payment Timing; Billing Errors. The payment timing is described in Customer's Order. If payment timing is not specified in Customer’s Order, Customer must pay all undisputed Fees within 30 days of Customer’s receipt of Grammarly’s invoice.  Late payments may be subject to a service charge of the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum amount allowed by law. If Customer believes the invoice contains an error (“**Billing Error**”), Customer must send a written notice to Grammarly describing the error in reasonable detail within 30 days of Customer’s receipt of the disputed invoice. The Parties will use good faith efforts to resolve the Billing Error. If the Parties are unable to resolve the Billing Error within 60 days of Customer’s receipt of the disputed invoice, then the Parties will be free to exercise any legal or contractual remedies available to them.  
  
2.3 Taxes. Unless otherwise expressly specified in an Order and as required by applicable law, Fees are exclusive of any Taxes. Other than taxes on Grammarly’s net income, Customer is responsible for paying any Taxes assessed in connection with Customer’s subscription to the Service. Grammarly will invoice Customer for such Taxes if Grammarly believes it has a legal obligation to do so, and Customer agrees to pay such Taxes if so invoiced. If Customer claims exemption from any Taxes under this Agreement, Customer must provide Grammarly with a valid tax exemption certificate or tax ID at the time of Order, and after receipt of valid evidence of exemption, Grammarly will not include the Taxes on the relevant invoice to Customer.   
  
2.4 Notice of Fee Changes. If Grammarly intends to change the Fees following the end of Customer’s current Subscription Term, Grammarly will give Customer at least 30 days’ notice of that change prior to the renewal of Customer's then-current subscription. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer acknowledges that Grammarly may not provide notice for any changes in Fees that occur due to a change in the fees charged by a Third-Party Service provider for a Third Party Service.  
  
2.5 Free Trials or Programs. If Customer registers for a free trial or program for any Service, Grammarly will provide such Service to Customer on a trial basis free of charge until the earlier of (a) the end of the free trial or program period; (b) the start date of any paid subscription to such Service; or (c) termination of the free trial or program by either Party, in its sole discretion.

10\. Indemnification
--------------------

10.1 Grammarly Indemnification. Grammarly will defend Customer against any third-party legal proceedings and will indemnify Customer against settlement amounts as well as damages and costs finally awarded in the third-party legal proceeding (“**Indemnified Amounts**”) to the extent arising from an allegation that the Services or any Outputs therefrom, infringes the third party's Intellectual Property Rights. This indemnification obligation will not apply to the extent the underlying allegation arises from (a) Customer’s breach of this Agreement; (b) a modification or combination of the Services by Customer with materials not provided by Grammarly under this Agreement, unless such modification or combination is required by this Agreement; or (c) Services provided under a free trial or program. For third-party infringement claims related to Output generated by the Service, Grammarly’s indemnification obligations will not apply to the extent (a) the Customer Content used to generate the allegedly infringing Output independently infringes or misappropriates a third party’s Intellectual Property Rights or could reasonably be expected to elicit infringing Output from the Service; (b) Customer modifies, uses or distributes the Output in a manner that is reasonably likely to infringe or misappropriate a third party’s Intellectual Property Rights; or (c) a third party alleges that the Output violates that third party’s trademark or other related rights.  
  
10.2 Customer Indemnification. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Customer will defend Grammarly against any third-party legal proceedings and will indemnify Grammarly against Indemnified Amounts to the extent arising from (a) Customer Data or (b) Customer's and Customer's End Users’ access or use of the Services in breach of this Agreement. The indemnification obligations will not apply to the extent the underlying allegation arises from Grammarly’s breach of this Agreement.   
  
10.3 Notice Requirement. The indemnified party must promptly notify the indemnifying party in writing of any allegation(s) that preceded the third-party legal proceeding and cooperate reasonably with the indemnifying party to resolve the allegation(s) and third-party legal proceeding. With respect to any allegation that an Output infringes a third party’s Intellectual Property Rights, Customer will use reasonable efforts to cease its use, display, and dissemination of such Output immediately upon receipt of notice of the allegation, and the parties will work together in good faith to mitigate any additional infringement claims. If breach of this notification obligation prejudices the defense of the legal proceeding, the indemnifying party's obligations will be reduced in proportion to the prejudice.  
  
10.4 Sole Control Requirement. The indemnified party must give sole control of the indemnified portion of the third-party legal proceeding to the indemnifying party, subject to the following: (a) the indemnified party may appoint its own non-controlling counsel, at its own expense; and (b) any settlement requiring the indemnified party to admit liability, pay money, or take (or refrain from taking) any action, will require the indemnified party's prior written consent, which is not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.  
  
10.5 Remedies. If Grammarly reasonably believes the Services might infringe a third party's Intellectual Property Rights, then Grammarly may, at its sole option and expense (a) procure the right for Customer to continue using the Services; (b) modify the Services to make them non-infringing without materially reducing their functionality; or (c) replace the Services with a non-infringing, functionally equivalent alternative. If none of the foregoing remedies is reasonably feasible, Grammarly may terminate Customer's use of the Services and the impacted Order, and upon such termination, Grammarly will provide Customer with a pro-rata refund of prepaid and unused Fees for the Services.  
  
10.6 Sole Remedy. Without affecting either party's termination rights, this **Section 10** states the parties' sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement for any third-party allegations of Intellectual Property Rights infringement covered by this **Section 10**.

11\. 1 Arbitration Requirements and Procedures. Except with respect to enforcing claims for injunctive or equitable relief, any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement or the interpretation, application, enforcement, breach, termination, or validity thereof (including any claim of inducement of this Agreement by fraud and including determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate) or its subject matter (collectively, “**Disputes**”) will be determined by binding arbitration before one arbitrator. The arbitration will be administered by JAMS conducted in accordance with the expedited procedures set forth in the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures as those Rules exist on the date Customer first creates its account or accesses and/or uses the Services, including Rules 16.1 and 16.2 of those Rules. The arbitration will be held in San Francisco, California, and it will be conducted in the English language. The Parties will maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and any award, including the hearing, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or judicial decision. The arbitrator will have authority to award compensatory damages only and is not empowered to award any punitive, exemplary, or multiple damages, and the Parties waive any right to recover any such damages. The Parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C., Secs. 1-16). Each Party will be responsible for its respective fees, including attorney’s and expert’s fees, in pursuing or defending a claim hereunder.

Nothing herein will preclude either Party from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.   
  
11.2 No Class Actions. NEITHER PARTY MAY PURSUE ANY CLAIM AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY AS A CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.  CLAIMS REGARDING ANY DISPUTE AND REMEDIES SOUGHT AS PART OF A CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION MUST BE BROUGHT ON AN INDIVIDUAL (NON-CLASS, NONREPRESENTATIVE) BASIS.
