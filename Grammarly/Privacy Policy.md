This information also helps us communicate with you about your use of our Products, product announcements and software updates, as well as respond to your requests for assistance (including providing account verification support if you’re having difficultly accessing your account). In addition, we may use your Personal Information to send you direct marketing emails and special offers. For more information, please see the section below entitled, “Will Grammarly Send Me Emails?”

We collect this information in order to help us deliver and support our Products, including by localizing your experience. This information also helps us improve our understanding of how our users use the Products.

*   Unique device identifier for devices that are using Grammarly software. We use this information to (i) calculate aggregate statistics on the number of unique devices using our Products, and (ii) detect and prevent misuse of our Products. Our third-party fraud detection partner also uses device identifiers for the detection and prevention of fraud and malicious use of our Products.

The Site and the Software also collect and receive information from your computer or mobile device, including the activities you perform within your account, the type of hardware and software you are using (for example, your operating system, word processing or other productivity software and browser type) and information obtained from cookies.

Web beacons allow us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.

We use a third party to gather information about how you and others use the Site. For example, we will know how many users access a specific page and which links they clicked on. We use this aggregated information to better understand and optimize the Site.

Gathering this kind of information helps us administer our Products, provide convenient and personalized user access and improve the features and usability of our Products.

In addition, we automatically gather non-personally identifiable information that indicates your association with one of our business partners or certain promotions. We use this information to determine the amount of revenue share payments to make to partners with whom we might have such arrangements and to provide anonymized aggregate reports.

Grammarly is committed to protecting the security of your information and takes reasonable precautions to protect it.

Once we receive your data, we protect it on our servers using a combination of administrative, physical and logical security safeguards. The security of the information stored locally in any of our Products installed on your computing device requires that you make use of the security features of your device. We recommend that you take the appropriate steps to secure all computing devices that you use with our applications and service.

If Grammarly learns of a security system breach, we may attempt to notify you and provide information on protective steps, if available, through the email address that you have provided to us or by posting a notice on the Site. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive such notices in writing.
