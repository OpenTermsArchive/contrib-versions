This Privacy Policy is incorporated into Grammarly’s Terms of Service and License Agreement, located at grammarly.com/terms, and applies to the information obtained by us through your use of Grammarly’s Site, Software, and Services (“Information”) as described in this Policy. Capitalized terms used in this Policy and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings provided for those terms in the Terms of Service.

When you sign up for or use our Services, you voluntarily give us certain Personal Data, including:

*   Your username, email address, and contact and language preferences. If you log into Grammarly with a social networking credential, such as with your Facebook or Google account, we will ask permission to access basic information from that account, such as your name and email address. You can stop sharing that information with us at any time by removing Grammarly’s access to that account.
    
*   Your payment information, if you are a paying customer. This is required to complete a commercial transaction on the Site. We use this information to enable and fulfill your transaction. If you choose to use PayPal® to finalize and pay for your order, you will provide your credit card number directly to PayPal®. The privacy policy of PayPal® will apply to the information you provide on the PayPal® website.
    

Other Information we collect

We collect this information as you use the Site, Software, and/or Services:

*   User Content. This consists of all text, documents, or other content or information uploaded, entered, or otherwise transmitted by you in connection with your use of the Services and/or Software.
    
*   Names of user contacts (if you are using the Grammarly Keyboard). The Grammarly Keyboard may request or obtain access to the names of your contacts on your device. This access helps the Grammarly Keyboard recognize when you are typing names so it can make appropriate suggestions (for example, if you misspell a name).

*   Usage information. This is information about the Grammarly Site, Software, and/or Services you use and how you use them. We may also obtain data from our third-party partners and service providers to analyze how users use our Site, Software, and/or Services. For example, we will know how many users access a specific page on the Site and which links they clicked on. We use this aggregated information to better understand and optimize the Site.
    
*   Device information. This is data from your computer or mobile device, such as the type of hardware and software you are using (for example, your operating system and browser type), as well as unique device identifiers for devices that are using Grammarly Software.
    
*   Cookies. Data obtained from cookies is described in the “Does Grammarly use cookies?” section and in our Cookie Policy.

*   …we use service providers who assist us in meeting business operations needs, including hosting, delivering, and improving our Services.

*   …we have your explicit consent to share your Personal Data.

*   …we need to do so in connection with a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, reorganization, sale of some or all of our assets or stock, public offering of securities, or steps in consideration of such activities (e.g., due diligence). In these cases some or all of your Personal Data may be shared with or transferred to another entity, subject to this Privacy Policy.
    

We may disclose Non-Personal Data publicly and to third parties—for example, in public reports about word usage, to partners under agreement with us, or as part of progress reports we may provide to users.

Through the use of cookies, we help deliver advertisements for relevant Grammarly products and services to you. For more details on cookies, please see the “Does Grammarly use cookies?” section below.

Those applications will provide you with notice and request your consent in order to obtain such access or information. Please consider your selection of such applications and services, and your permissions, carefully.

We also may want to contact you with information about products and services from our business partners. You may opt out of such communications at any time by clicking the “unsubscribe” link found within Grammarly emails and changing your contact preferences.

Grammarly is committed to protecting the security of your Information and takes reasonable precautions to protect it.

We use industry-standard encryption to protect your data in transit. This is commonly referred to as transport layer security (“TLS”) or secure socket layer (“SSL”) technology.

Once we receive your data, we protect it on our servers using a combination of technical, physical, and logical security safeguards. The security of the data stored locally in any of our Software installed on your computing device requires that you make use of the security features of your device. We recommend that you take the appropriate steps to secure all computing devices that you use in connection with our Site, Software, and Services.

If Grammarly learns of a security system breach, we may attempt to notify you and provide information on protective steps, if available, through the email address that you have provided to us or by posting a notice on the Site. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive such notices in writing.

However, we may keep some of your Personal Data for as long as reasonably necessary for our legitimate business interests, including fraud detection and prevention and to comply with our legal obligations including tax, legal reporting, and auditing obligations.

What happens if Grammarly closes my account?

If Grammarly closes your account due to your violation of the Terms of Service, then you may contact Grammarly to request deletion of your data. Grammarly will evaluate such requests on a case by case basis, pursuant to our legal obligations.

Will this Privacy Policy ever change?

As Grammarly evolves, we may need to update this Policy to keep pace with changes in our Site, Software, and Services, our business, and laws applicable to us and you. We will, however, always maintain our commitment to respect your privacy. We will notify you of any material changes that impact your rights under this Policy by email (to your most recently provided email address) or post any other revisions to this Policy, along with their effective date, in an easy-to-find area of the Site, so we recommend that you periodically check back here to stay informed of any changes. Please note that your continued use of Grammarly after any change means that you agree with and consent to be bound by the new Policy.

For California usersSupplemental Privacy Notice for California residents

This Supplemental Privacy Notice supplements the information in our Privacy Policy above and applies to California residents only.

Summary of information we collect

If you’re a California resident, California law requires us to provide you with some additional information about how we collect, use, and disclose your “personal information” (as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)).

Throughout this Privacy Policy, we discuss in detail the specific pieces of personal information we collect from and about users, and how we share that information. Under the CCPA, we’re also required to provide you with the “categories” of personal information we collect and disclose for business purposes (as defined by applicable law). Those categories are: identifiers (such as name, email address, or social network account and profile data). commercial information (such as transaction data for a paid account). financial data (such as payment method or financial account information). internet or other network or device activity (such as IP address and usage information). location information (e.g., the general location where you use your device when interacting with the Site, Software or Services). sensory information (such as audio recordings if you call our customer service). inference data about you. and other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you.

We and our service providers may use the categories of personal information we collect from and about you consistent with the various business and commercial purposes we discuss throughout this Privacy Policy. Please see the relevant section(s) above for more information.

We may also use the categories of personal information for compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and we may aggregate the information we collect or de-identify the information to limit or prevent identification of any particular user or device.

Rights

If you’re a California resident, you may have certain rights. California law may permit you to request that we:

*   Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you.
    
*   Provide you a summary of the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about you in the last twelve months. the categories of sources of such information. the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information. and the categories of third parties with whom we shared personal information.
    
*   Delete certain information we have about you.
    

You may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you (if any). You also have the right not to be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising certain of your rights. Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. For example, we need certain types of information so that we can provide the Site, Software, and Services to you. If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use the Site, Software, and Services.

To exercise these rights, you can:

*   Request a personal data report by submitting a support ticket through this link. You must be signed into your Grammarly account to submit this request, and you will be required to log into your account to access the summary or the report.
    
*   Request the summary described above by submitting a support ticket or emailing support@grammarly.com.
    
*   Delete your personal information from Grammarly by deleting your account. You must be signed into your Grammarly account to submit this request, and you will be required to provide your password to confirm that you want to delete your account.
    
*   You can also submit requests by submitting a support ticket or emailing support@grammarly.com.
    

You’ll need to provide us with information sufficient to verify your identity before we can satisfy your request. To do so, you’ll need to log into your account or provide us with certain information regarding yourself and/or your usage of the Site, Software, and Services. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. To do so, you need to provide us with written authorization for the agent to act on your behalf. You will still need to verify your identity directly with us.

The CCPA sets forth certain obligations for businesses that “sell” personal information. Based on the definition of “sell” under the CCPA and under current regulatory guidance, we don’t believe we engage in such activity and have not engaged in such activity in the past twelve months. We do share certain information as described in the “Information access and disclosure” section above, and we allow third parties to collect certain information about your activity, for example through cookies, as explained in our Cookie Policy. You can control these cookies through browser settings and other controls. for more information, see our Cookie Policy.

California Shine the Light

If you’re a California resident, you can ask for a list of third parties that have received your information for direct marketing purposes during the previous calendar year. This list also contains the types of information shared. We provide this list at no cost. To make such a request, contact us at support@grammarly.com.
