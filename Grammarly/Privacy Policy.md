Privacy Policy
--------------

([View Previous Version](https://www.grammarly.com/privacy-policy-november-2024))  
  
When you use Grammarly’s products, you’re trusting us to handle your personal data with care. We take that trust seriously.   
  
**When this policy applies:** We, Grammarly, Inc., provide this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, use, and disclose your personal data when you interact with us as an individual, such as when you create an account and receive our products directly from us. It also applies when you browse our websites, our mobile or tablet-based applications, and productivity application services offered in connection with the websites or similarly interact with us, such as by subscribing to our marketing emails. As used in this Privacy Policy, “Grammarly” refers to both Grammarly and Coda products, unless otherwise specified.    
  
**When this policy doesn’t apply:** If you use our products under the management of a company, organization, or other legal entity (for example, Grammarly Business, Grammarly for Education, Grammarly Pro, or Coda as applicable), then this Privacy Policy does not apply to the Customer Personal Data (as defined in our [Grammarly Data Privacy Addendum](https://www.grammarly.com/media-resources/dpa)) you upload to such accounts. For those accounts, we process Customer Personal Data on behalf of and in accordance with the contract and data protection terms with such legal entity ([read more](https://www.grammarly.com/privacy-policy#sectionSingleColumn_2m292rcyHNO9V6e3TfFe2I)).   
  
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, in which case we will provide you with notice of material updates or seek your consent to the updates as may be required by applicable laws.  
  
**Summary**  
  
While we hope you read this entire Privacy Policy, here is a brief overview of some important points:  

* This policy explains our global privacy practices. If you live in certain places, additional disclosures may apply to you. For instance, if you reside in California, you can read our [California Notice at Collection,](https://www.grammarly.com/privacy-policy#sectionSingleColumn_47y4NWiOf89wt12wcc6a74) and if you reside in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), or Switzerland, you can read our [Supplemental EEA+ Privacy Statement](https://www.grammarly.com/eea-privacy-notice).  
    
* We make money when users purchase our paid products, and not by selling or monetizing your content. We offer a free product and hope you’ll purchase one of our paid products ([read more](https://www.grammarly.com/privacy-policy#sectionSingleColumn_2BY3yGiyOjdXcNjfiXIsCY)).   
    
* When you sign up for and use our products, we process your account information, and—if applicable—we work with payment processors to handle your payment information ([read more](https://www.grammarly.com/privacy-policy#sectionSingleColumn_7uOOWJJPY0z52gJF3HafYg)).  
    
* To provide you with writing suggestions in certain Grammarly products (such as Grammarly Free, Premium, and Pro), we process your text. To provide you with an optimized product, we also process some additional information, such as the type of device you’re using. For such products, we offer you tools in account settings to control how we use your text and personalize your experience ([read more](https://www.grammarly.com/privacy-policy#sectionSingleColumn_1ZFKil4JH2VO74XoITm1cJ)).  
    
* We have stringent security mechanisms in place to protect your data and maintain your privacy ([read more](https://www.grammarly.com/privacy-policy#sectionSingleColumn_1sdf4GsEf3NlWrsI9MXwIP)).  
    
* We use trusted service providers to help provide our products and describe other scenarios in which we may disclose information below ([read more](https://www.grammarly.com/privacy-policy#sectionSingleColumn_3pK9aQunp3MqHqBEM2VgFH)).  
    
* We offer and allow you to exercise privacy rights and choices, including as may be required under applicable laws ([read more](https://www.grammarly.com/privacy-policy#sectionSingleColumn_3cD2NaNV0m3ONXNF8C1cj0)).

How Does Grammarly Make Money? 
-------------------------------

We offer free and paid products, and we make money from subscriptions of the paid products. Grammarly does not monetize data or use the content customers upload to our products for advertising purposes.  

What Types of Personal Data Does Grammarly Collect?
---------------------------------------------------

We collect the following types of personal data:  

* **Account information** when you or your organization sign up for an account, which includes your email address, password, name, and email preferences, and, as applicable, job titles and phone numbers. If you sign up through a third-party service, like Google or Apple, we’ll collect the information from them that you authorize.  
    
* **Payment information** if you make a purchase or payment on our website(s), which includes payment transaction history and limited payment card information, including billing address. If you use PayPal, the Google Play Store, the Apple App Store, or another payment processor to finalize and pay for your order, you will provide your payment information directly to those providers, not us.  
    
* **Log data, application, network and device information**, which includes, for example, internet protocol (IP) address, device type, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, and operating system and platform.  
    
* **User content**, which consists of all the text and documents that you upload, enter, or otherwise transmit to us when you use our products. For information on how we use, process, protect, and store user content, please see [For What Purposes Does Grammarly Use Personal Data](https://www.grammarly.com/privacy-policy#sectionSingleColumn_1ZFKil4JH2VO74XoITm1cJ) and [How Does Grammarly Secure and Store Personal Data?](https://www.grammarly.com/privacy-policy#sectionSingleColumn_572yz4dIpV8Vs0noJxPXC) You can also review our [Technical Specifications](https://www.grammarly.com/technical-specifications), as applicable.   
    
* **Usage data** includes information about how you use and interact with our products. For example, we collect usage data to provide you with weekly activity reports, personalized insights on how to optimize your use of our products, and performance optimization in the sites and applications you use our products in. For more information on the types of usage data we collect and how we process it, please see our [Technical Specifications](https://www.grammarly.com/technical-specifications).  
    
* **Cookie information** and other identifiers to enable our systems to recognize your browser or device and provide, protect, improve, and promote our products and services.   
    
* **Names of user contacts in the Grammarly Keyboard (on-device storage only)** to make appropriate spelling suggestions. The Grammarly Keyboard may request or obtain access to your contacts’ names on your device. For instance, Grammarly will not try to autocorrect names in your list of contacts. These names will be stored solely on your device within the Grammarly Keyboard app and are never sent to Grammarly servers.  
    
* **Other information you provide directly to us**, such as in situations where you may have the option to submit additional information as you use our products or when you interact with our customer support or sales teams. For example, you may choose to participate in surveys where you can provide feedback on our products.  
    
* **Inferences**. We may also derive information or draw inferences about you based on the information we collect. For example, we may make inferences about your approximate location based on your IP address, infer that you are looking to purchase certain Grammarly products based on your browsing behavior and past purchases, and, depending upon your account settings, we may infer the industry you work in based on your writing and other metadata, or infer writing style preferences based on your prior use of our products.  
    

  

Does Grammarly Obtain Any Data From Third-Party Sources?
--------------------------------------------------------

Yes, we sometimes obtain information about you from our partners or others that we use to make our information and our products better or more useful. This data may be combined with the other information we collect and might include aggregate-level data, such as which IP addresses correspond to zip codes or countries. Or it might be more specific, such as data about your company or job function, which we may use, for example, to advertise Grammarly products to you.   

For What Purposes Does Grammarly Use Personal Data?
---------------------------------------------------

The ways in which we use your personal data depend, in part, on how you use our products and what preferences you set.   
  
We use your personal data for the following specific purposes:  

* **Providing and tailoring our products to you.** We use your personal data to operate our products and provide a rich, interactive, and personalized experience. For example, we process your user content and usage data to show you appropriate suggestions, personalize our suggestions based on the content and context of your usage, and offer tips on optimizing your use of our products. As another example, if you set up a personal dictionary, we will customize your suggestions to account for your personal dictionary. For more details about how we process your personal data when you use applicable Grammarly products and the controls available to you, please see our [Technical Specifications](https://www.grammarly.com/technical-specifications).  
    
* **Communicate with you.** We use your personal data to communicate with you and to resolve any issues that you may encounter with our products. For example, if you contact our support team, we may need access to account information in order to respond to your request. Or, for example, we may use your personal data to communicate with you about product-related notifications such as product updates or account-related matters such as invoices.   
    
* **Troubleshooting and debugging our products.** We use personal data to resolve technical issues that arise with our products. For example, we use log data to track outages.  
    
* **Building and improving our products.** We’re continually developing new methods to make our products smarter, faster, more secure, and more helpful. Our privacy-preserving uses of personal data are core to continually improving Grammarly’s product offerings and maintaining a high-quality product experience. For example, we refer to usage data to help us decide what new features to build. As set forth in our [Technical Specifications](https://www.grammarly.com/technical-specifications), for applicable Grammarly products, you are in control of whether your user content is used for training and improvement of our models. For applicable Grammarly products, you can learn more about these controls, how we build and improve our products, and the steps we take to preserve your privacy before doing so in our [Technical Specifications](https://www.grammarly.com/technical-specifications).  
    
* **Processing payments.** If you are a paying customer, we work with payment processors to process your payment information to enable your transaction.  
    
* **Promoting our products.** We use personal data to send promotional communications and to conduct marketing research. For example, depending on your location, communications preferences, and consent settings (as applicable), we may use account information to send you personalized marketing emails about new products or offers, from which you can unsubscribe.  
    
* **Managing Events**. We use personal data to manage event registrations, seminars, panels, discussions, and other event attendance. We may process your personal information to plan and host events or webinars for which you have registered, inquired about, or that you attend, including sending related communications to you.  
    
* **Complying with legal obligations and protecting against harm.** We use personal data to: (a) comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal processes, and governmental requests, (b) protect our or others’ legal rights, and (c) protect ourselves or our users from fraud, abuse, or other illegal or potentially harmful activities.  
    

  

How Does Grammarly Secure and Store Personal Data?
--------------------------------------------------

**Grammarly products**  
  
As described in more detail on our [Security page](https://www.grammarly.com/security), we use a combination of technical, physical, and logical safeguards designed to secure your data. These safeguards include encryption, secure network configuration, data transfer restrictions, restricted employee access, and other measures.  
  
We retain personal data for as long as necessary to provide our products to you, to complete the transactions you have requested, to comply with our legal obligations, and to resolve any disputes. For more information, please see our [Technical Specifications](https://www.grammarly.com/technical-specifications#sectionSingleColumn_4L6TzGQmY9msWQw1iwNlgn).  
  
When it comes to user content, by default, we process user content associated with your account to provide services to you (for example, writing suggestions, customization, and insights on how to use our features). For troubleshooting and product improvement, we typically retain user content for no longer than one year, after which we either delete or de-identify the content unless you choose to retain it in your account for longer or specifically ask us to delete it sooner, subject to any legal obligations requiring us to maintain the content for a longer period. We also pseudonymize, aggregate, and/or de-identify data and content when providing our services to you as described in our [Technical Specifications](https://www.grammarly.com/technical-specifications). With the Grammarly Editor, we will store documents you create until you delete them or we close your account.  
  
**Coda**   
  
For information about security and data storage with respect to Coda, see [https://coda.io/trust/security#application-security](https://coda.io/trust/security#application-security).  

To Whom Does Grammarly Disclose Personal Data?
----------------------------------------------

We may disclose personal data to the following types of companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Grammarly:  

* **Trusted service providers.** We use service providers like Amazon Web Services to provide services that allow us to serve our users. These trusted service providers are bound by agreements that require them to follow data privacy and security requirements and only use your data in the way we tell them to.   
    
* **Government agencies, regulators, and similar authorities.** We may disclose your information to governmental agencies, regulators, and other authorities or authorized parties if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or appropriate governmental request or (b) protect ourselves, our users, or others from fraud, abuse, or other illegal or potentially harmful activities.  
    
* **Organization IT administrators and representatives.** When you join Grammarly through a company, organization, or other legal entity (e.g., through Grammarly Business, Grammarly for Education, or certain Grammarly Pro offerings), the administrator of that team may access and control your Grammarly account (for Grammarly products, see [below](https://www.grammarly.com/privacy-policy#sectionSingleColumn_2m292rcyHNO9V6e3TfFe2I)). If you created an account using an email address belonging to your employer or organization, we may share your email address with the administrators or representatives of that employer or organization to, for example, allow them to invite you to a Grammarly Business account or reach out to them about purchasing Grammarly Business.  
    
* **Other users.**  If you join a Coda, Grammarly Business or Grammarly for Education account or create an account with an email address belonging to your employer or organization, we may suggest you as a potential collaborator to other users of that account.  
    
* **Advertising partners**. We engage other companies to provide analytics services, serve advertisements promoting Grammarly across the web and in other companies’ mobile apps, and perform related services. We do not make user content available to these advertising partners. These companies may use cookies, web beacons, pixels, and other technologies to collect limited information about your interactions with our marketing websites, such as a cookie ID or device identifier and a link you click or page you visit on Grammarly’s websites. In addition, we may work with advertising partners to translate other identifiers, such as your email address, into a unique identifier (called a hashed value) that such partners can then use to show ads promoting Grammarly on other websites and online services. These disclosures of hashed identifiers and information disclosed through advertising cookies and similar technologies may constitute “targeted advertising,” “sharing,” or “selling” under certain privacy laws, and you may opt out at any time. See the “[Your Opt-Out Rights and Communication Choices](https://www.grammarly.com/privacy-policy#sectionSingleColumn_3cD2NaNV0m3ONXNF8C1cj0)” section for information about how to opt out of these disclosures.   
    
* **An acquirer of Grammarly’s business or assets.** We may disclose personal data to manage or give effect to a reorganization, restructuring, merger, acquisition, or whole or partial sale or transfer of our business or assets (“**Business Transaction**”) that our business decides to enter into. We’ll notify you (for example, via a message to the email address associated with your account) of any Business Transaction involving your personal data and outline your choices in that event.  
    
* **With your consent or otherwise at your direction.** If you consent to us disclosing your personal data to a particular recipient or otherwise direct us to do so, we may do so.

California Notice at Collection & Additional Information for Residents of Certain US States
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some US states have enacted privacy laws that grant their residents certain rights and require specific disclosures (“**State Privacy Laws**”). If you reside in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Texas, Utah, or Virginia, this section applies to you. **This section also serves as our California notice at collection.**  
  
_Additional Disclosures_  
  
Above we explain how we [collect](https://www.grammarly.com/privacy-policy#sectionSingleColumn_7uOOWJJPY0z52gJF3HafYg), [use](https://www.grammarly.com/privacy-policy#sectionSingleColumn_1ZFKil4JH2VO74XoITm1cJ), and [disclose](https://www.grammarly.com/privacy-policy#sectionSingleColumn_3pK9aQunp3MqHqBEM2VgFH) information about you, as well as our [targeted advertising practices](https://www.grammarly.com/privacy-policy#sectionSingleColumn_3pK9aQunp3MqHqBEM2VgFH). As required by certain State Privacy Laws, we use the tables below to explain this same information.   
  
_Use, Disclosure, and Retention of Personal Information for Business Purposes_  

![ Use, Disclosure, and Retention of Personal Information for Business Purposes ](https://static-web.grammarly.com/1e6ajr2k4140/54xcLxsYvlaWyWhPkD2GMp/ca8c4a9b1c7f0382ffa31e04b6e276ba/Frame_16__6_.png?w=11295)

  
When we process information that is considered “sensitive” under State Privacy Laws (such as when such information is included in your user content, including the content of communications you use Grammarly products to edit and improve), we use such data only for the legally permitted purposes described [above](#sectionSingleColumn_6bK2Xll9RxNtqJ4sHgXCuN), in the same way we process user content generally. We similarly limit how we process account log-in information, which may be considered “sensitive” under certain State Privacy Laws. We do not use or disclose such information for the purpose of inferring characteristics about you.  
  
As described in the “[What Types of Personal Data Does Grammarly Collect](https://www.grammarly.com/privacy-policy#sectionSingleColumn_7uOOWJJPY0z52gJF3HafYg)?” and “[Does Grammarly Obtain Any Data from Third Party Sources?](https://www.grammarly.com/privacy-policy#sectionSingleColumn_1tmlS8o6KQPFidDKvQ6mDE)” sections above, we collect personal information from various sources, including directly from you, automatically when you access or use our products, and from third-party sources.   
  
We may use data that has been de-identified so that it can no longer reasonably be used to identify you for any purpose. We commit to maintaining and using such information in de-identified form and not to attempt to re-identify the information, except for the purpose of determining whether our de-identification processes satisfy applicable legal requirements.  
  
_Retention_  
  
We retain personal data for as long as necessary to provide our products to you, to complete the transactions you have requested, to comply with our legal obligations, and to resolve any disputes. For more information about retention generally and protections for user content specifically, please see "[How Does Grammarly Secure and Store Personal Data?](https://www.grammarly.com/privacy-policy#sectionSingleColumn_1sdf4GsEf3NlWrsI9MXwIP)" and our [Technical Specifications](https://www.grammarly.com/technical-specifications#sectionSingleColumn_4L6TzGQmY9msWQw1iwNlgn) (as applicable).  
  
_Sales, Sharing, and Targeted Advertising Activities_  
  
We also disclose certain categories of personal information to advertising partners in order to promote Grammarly on third-party websites and services. These disclosures may be considered “sales,” “sharing,” or use of personal information for “targeted advertising” under State Privacy Laws, and the table below provides more information about our practices.   

![Category of Personal Information Disclosed ](https://static-web.grammarly.com/1e6ajr2k4140/4MkJN1kipiltAcisa0gv8C/aeed10ba1dfb838bb2cdf60a34e4e2f8/Frame_12__1_.svg)

  
We do not engage in sales, sharing, or targeted advertising using personal information about anyone we know to be under the age of 18.   
  
_Your Rights under State Privacy Laws_  
  
**Opt Out of Sales, Sharing, and Targeted Advertising**  
  
You may opt out of activities that we engage in that may constitute “targeted advertising,” “sharing,” or “sales” of personal information under the State Privacy Laws. To do so:    
  

* Grammarly and Coda offer controls on our websites to turn off use of cookies, pixels, and similar technologies for such purposes. Please follow the prompts behind the “Your Privacy Choices” links offered in the footer of Grammarly websites and Coda websites to opt out of such activities for each service. (For Coda, you can also access such controls [here](https://coda.io/trust/cookies).) Your opt-out choice will be linked to your browser only; therefore, you will need to renew your opt-out choice if you visit Grammarly or Coda websites from a new device or browser, or if you clear your browser’s cookies. You can also opt out by visiting Grammarly or Coda websites with a legally recognized universal opt-out signal enabled, such as the Global Privacy Control.  
    
* You may also opt out of Grammarly sharing a hashed version of your email address with advertising partners to promote Grammarly on third-party websites and services. If you have a Grammarly account, use the control in your account settings to do so. If you do not have a Grammarly account, please contact us at privacy@grammarly.com to opt out.
