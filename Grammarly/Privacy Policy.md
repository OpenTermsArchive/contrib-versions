How Does Grammarly Make Money? 
-------------------------------

We offer free and paid products, and we make money from subscriptions of the paid products. We don’t sell your data.  

What Information Does Grammarly Process or Collect?
---------------------------------------------------

We process or collect information to provide, build, protect, improve, and promote our products. The information we collect includes account and payment information you provide, as well as log data and device information that we collect automatically.   
  
Here are the categories of information we collect or process:  

* **Account information** when you sign up for an account, which includes your email address, password, name, and email preferences. If you sign up through a third-party service, like Google or Apple, we’ll collect the information from them that you authorize.   
    
* **Payment information** if you are a paying customer, which includes payment transaction history and limited payment card information. If you use PayPal, the Google Play Store, the Apple App Store or another payment processor to finalize and pay for your order, you will provide your payment information directly to those providers, not us.  
    
* **Log data and device information**, which includes internet protocol (IP) address, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, and operating system and platform.  
    
* **Sales and support data**, which is the personal information you share with us when you interact with our customer support and sales teams.   
    
* **User content**, which consists of all the text and documents that you upload, enter, or otherwise transmit when you use our products. For information on how we use, process, protect, and store user content, please see [How Does Grammarly Use Personal Information](#sectionSingleColumn_4wCvOJM48EUdjmdLE7jWdh) and [How Does Grammarly Secure and Store Personal Information?](https://www.grammarly.com/privacy-policy#sectionSingleColumn_4C6KOleBeBhbafKqrRoEsj)  
    
* **Usage data**, which includes information about how you use and interact with our products. For example, we collect usage data to provide you with weekly activity reports.   
    
* **Cookie information and other identifiers** to enable our systems to recognize your browser or device and provide, protect, and improve our products. For more information, see our [Cookie Policy](https://www.grammarly.com/cookie-policy). Note that our products currently do not respond to Do Not Track requests.   
    
* **Third-party information**, such as data about organizations, industries, lists of companies that are customers, website visitors, marketing campaigns, and other matters related to our business from affiliates and subsidiaries, our partners, or others that we use to make our information better or more useful. This data may be combined with the other information we collect and might include aggregate-level data, such as which IP addresses correspond to zip codes or countries. Or it might be more specific: for example, how well an online marketing or email campaign performed.  
    
* **Names of user contacts in the Grammarly Keyboard (on-device storage only)** to make appropriate spelling suggestions. The Grammarly Keyboard may request or obtain access to your contacts’ names on your device. For instance, Grammarly will not try to autocorrect names in your list of contacts. These names will be stored solely on your device within the Grammarly Keyboard app and are never sent to Grammarly servers.  
    
* **Other information you provide directly to us.** You may have the option to submit additional information as you use our products. For example, you may choose to participate in surveys where you can provide feedback on the product.  
    

  

How Does Grammarly Use Personal Information?
--------------------------------------------

We use your information to provide, build, protect, improve, and promote our products.  
  
The way we use your information depends, in part, on how you use our products and what preferences you set.  
  
We use your information for the following specific purposes:  

* **Providing Grammarly products to you.** We use data to operate our products and provide a rich, interactive experience. For example, we process your user content to show you appropriate writing suggestions.  
    
* **Personalizing Grammarly for you.** We use personal information to tailor your Grammarly experience and enhance your communication abilities. For example, if you set up a personal dictionary, we will customize your suggestions to account for your personal dictionary.  
    
* **Providing support to you.** We need personal information to resolve issues that you encounter with our products. For example, if you contact our support team, we may need access to account information in order to respond to your request.  
    
* **Troubleshooting and debugging our products.** We need data to resolve technical issues that arise with our products. For example, we use log data to track outages.  
    
* **Building and improving our products.** We’re continually developing new methods to make our products smarter, faster, more secure, and more helpful. We use data to help us do so. For example, we refer to usage data to help us decide what new features to build.  
    
* **Processing payments.** If you are a paying customer, we need payment information to enable your transaction.  
    
* **Promoting our products.** We use data to send promotional communications. For example, depending on your location, we may use account information to send you marketing emails about new products or offers, from which you can unsubscribe.   
    
* **Ensuring our and our users’ safety and security.** We need personal information to protect Grammarly against fraud and abuse. For example, we may need to use your account information to verify your activity and protect against malicious, deceptive, or illegal activity.  
    
* **Supporting and selling our products**. We use sales and support data to promote and sell our products to you and to provide you with support. Some of these activities are provided by service providers with whom we have contracted.  
    
* **Complying with legal obligations.** We use personal information where required by law or where we believe it is necessary to protect our or others’ legal rights. For example, we may process account information to help you exercise your data protection rights.  
    

  
  
We use automated and manual processing techniques when using information for these purposes. Our automated methods include artificial intelligence (AI), which is a set of technologies that allow computers to perform tasks that would typically require human knowledge and intelligence. Our manual methods frequently work in conjunction with, and support, our automated methods, and all of our data handling is subject to the security practices described at [https://www.grammarly.com/trust](https://www.grammarly.com/trust).   

How Does Grammarly Secure and Store Personal Information?
---------------------------------------------------------

As described in more detail on our [Security page](https://www.grammarly.com/security), we use a combination of technical, physical, and logical safeguards to secure your data. These safeguards include encryption, secure network configuration, data transfer restrictions, restricted employee access, and several other measures.   
  
Grammarly retains personal information for as long as necessary to provide our products to you, to complete the transactions you have requested, or for other legitimate purposes such as to comply with our legal obligations or resolve disputes.  
  
When it comes to user content, by default, we process user content associated with your account to provide services to you (for example, writing suggestions). After that, if you did not choose to retain that content, we either delete or de-identify it. With the Grammarly Editor, we will store documents you create until you delete them. For more information, please visit [https://www.grammarly.com/trust](https://www.grammarly.com/trust).  
  
Some of our optional product features will provide personalized writing suggestions. When we offer those personalized features to you, we will describe how we use and store your information to provide those features.   

With Whom Does Grammarly Share Personal Information?
----------------------------------------------------

We don’t sell your personal information. We do share your information with certain third parties, as described below, to provide, build, protect, improve, and promote our products and as required by law.  

* **Trusted service providers.** We use service providers like Amazon Web Services to provide, protect, promote, and improve our products. These trusted third parties are bound by agreements that require them to follow our data privacy and security requirements and only use your data in the way we tell them to.   
    
* **Government agencies, regulators, and other authorized third parties.** We may disclose your information to governmental agencies, regulators, and other third parties if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or appropriate governmental request; (b) protect any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud, harm, or abuse of Grammarly or our users; or (d) perform a task carried out in the public interest.  
    
* **An acquirer of Grammarly’s business or assets.** In case of a merger, sale, or reorganization of all or part of our business, information covered by this policy may be transferred in connection with that deal. We’ll notify you (for example, via a message to the email address associated with your account) of any such deal and outline your choices in that event.  
    
* **Organization IT administrators and representatives.** When you join a Grammarly Business or Grammarly for Education team account, the administrator of that team may access and control your Grammarly account (see [Notice to End Users on a Grammarly Business or Grammarly for Education Team Account](#sectionSingleColumn_3Z1LRU777j7BhLK4OZuaCG) below). If you created an account using an email address belonging to your employer or organization, we may share your email address with the administrators or representatives of that employer or organization to, for example, allow them to invite you to a Grammarly Business team or reach out to them about purchasing Grammarly Business.  
    
* **Other users.** If you join a Grammarly Business or Grammarly for Education team account or create an account with an email address belonging to your employer or organization, we may suggest you as a potential collaborator to other users of that organization.  
    
* **With your consent or otherwise at your direction.** If you consent to share your personal information or otherwise direct us, we may do so.  
    

  

Does Grammarly Collect Personal Information from Children?
----------------------------------------------------------

Unless your Grammarly account is part of a Grammarly for Education team, Grammarly does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we determine we have collected personal information from a child younger than 13 years of age, we will take reasonable measures to remove that information from our systems. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any personal information through our products. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s internet usage and to help enforce this Privacy Policy by making sure that their children do not provide personal information through our products.  
  
Please note that in some jurisdictions, the age of digital consent is older than 13. If you are in one of those jurisdictions, you must be at least that age to use our products.
