### Overview

At Amazon Advertising, we believe that maintaining a high customer experience bar for the ads we serve helps us drive better results for you, our advertisers. Accordingly, we have set customer-centric Ad Policies to help preserve and enhance that experience. All advertising content must be appropriate for a general audience and for the type of placement in which it will be displayed, and, as an advertiser using Amazon Advertising, it is your responsibility to make sure that both you and your ads comply with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and industry standards in each geographical area where the advertisements may appear. You must be honest about the products or services that you promote and must avoid content that may mislead or offend our customers. Our policies are not intended as legal advice. We encourage you to consult with your legal advisor if you have questions about the laws and regulations concerning your ads.  
  
These ad policies apply to Amazon’s global Display Advertising business, for placements both on Amazon’s owned-and-operated properties and off Amazon. Separate Ad Policies apply to [sponsored ads](https://advertising.amazon.com/resources/ad-policy/sponsored-ads-policies?ref_=a20m_us_spcs_cap_spcs_sacap), [Book Ads](https://advertising.amazon.com/resources/ad-policy/book-ads?ref_=a20m_us_spcs_cap_spcs_bkad) and [Stores](https://advertising.amazon.com/resources/ad-policy/stores?ref_=a20m_us_spcs_cap_spcs_stcap). For technical requirements, please review the [ad specs](https://advertising.amazon.com/resources/ad-specs?ref_=a20m_us_spcs_cap_spcs).  
  
Amazon reserves the right to reject, remove or request modifications to an ad in its sole discretion, for any reason. Amazon may suspend or terminate your ad account(s) for severe or repeated Ad Policy violations. All examples are illustrative, and Amazon reserves the right to reject campaigns which do not meet its policies as determined in its sole discretion. For those policies that require prior approval by Amazon, please engage your appropriate client support team.  
  
We periodically update our policies. Please check this page often to ensure that you are always up to date with our latest policy requirements.  
  
Throughout this document, we refer to advertisers as “you/your”, to ad placements on Amazon’s owned-and-operated properties as “ads on Amazon”, and to Amazon DSP offsite as “ads off Amazon”.  
  
For an overview of policies addressing questions that commonly arise, please see our [Quick Reference Guide](https://advertising.amazon.com/resources/ad-policy/quick-reference?ref_=a20m_us_spcs_cap_spsc_qkrf). Please note: This guide is not intended to be a comprehensive overview of all ad policies. It is highlighting some key ad policies that frequently re-occur.  
  
To view recent updates to these policies, please see our [Ad Policy Change Log](https://advertising.amazon.com/resources/ad-policy/creative-acceptance/ad-policy-change-log?ref_=a20m_us_spcs_cap_spcs_chnglg).

### 1.0 General creative guidelines

We apply a high creative bar to ad content to ensure a consistent, high-quality customer experience. The policies in this section apply to all ads and serve to ensure a minimum quality bar.

### 1.1 Advertiser branding

Your brand name or logo must be clearly visible in the ad to ensure that customers can readily identify you as the advertiser.  
  
If an ad features both your brand name or logo and an Amazon logo, your brand name or logo must be the largest and most prominent.  
  
For ads promoting films, TV programmes, video games, music titles and apps, the name of a band or the title of a TV programme, film or video game can be treated as the brand name.

### 1.2 Background colours and borders

Customers must be able to distinguish ads from non-sponsored content on the page. Amazon imposes certain restrictions on background colours and design to ensure that ads are distinct from non-sponsored content on the page and that customers can identify the clickable spaces associated with an ad.  
  
Ads without borders cannot feature white or off-white background colour.  
  
If an ad does not have a border, it must feature a background colour that contrasts with the white/off-white background colour of the page. For example, ads without borders can feature a light grey background colour.  
  
Mobile ads cannot have a white bar dividing the creative, as this mimics elements of Amazon Mobile Gateway house creatives.  
  
Ads that take up most of the screen (such as mobile interstitial ads, tablet and Kindle wake screen ads) or are distinct from their page backgrounds because of ad placement design (such as Marquee ads, Seller Central login and homepage placements) do not require a border. See [individual specs pages](https://advertising.amazon.com/resources/ad-specs?ref_=a20m_us_spcs_cap_spcs) for more details about background and border requirements per ad product.

### 1.3 Distracting ads

Animation features and other interactive elements in ads must be engaging and complement the customer experience and must not distract or deceive.  
  
Prohibited distracting features include, but are not limited to,

*   Flashing, blinking or pulsating objects, images or text.
*   Frequent or fast contrast transitions (for example frames with multiple changes from white to black).
*   Excessive animation (for example, frame changes occur every one or two seconds or visual objects within the animation that seem to move constantly).
*   Animation that mimics user interaction, such as moving mouse cursors or clicking buttons.

### 1.4 Fake functionality

Fake functionality can trick customers into clicking on ads by believing that certain inactive elements of an ad are interactive and can provide value to them.  
  
Ad elements that a customer would usually expect to be able to interact with must be functional. For example, ads with a free text field prompting the customer to “enter your postcode” must lead to a landing page with information tailored to that customer’s postcode. Driving to a generic landing page or asking for the postcode to be re-entered is prohibited.

### 1.5 Image quality

Images in ads must meet the file size, resolution and file type restrictions that are specified per size/placement (see [ad specs](https://advertising.amazon.com/resources/ad-specs?ref_=a20m_us_spcs_cap_spcs) for more details).  
  
Prohibited low-quality images include, but are not limited to: crowded images with too many visual objects in one creative, blurry, distorted, low-resolution, pixellated, smudged or stretched images.

### 1.6 Sponsored Display custom images

Custom images allow you to include compelling images that represent your products or brand in context or a lifestyle setting in your ad. Images must not contradict the landing page and must be of high resolution and quality and aesthetically pleasing. Images must not:

*   Be individual or multiple product images on a solid or transparent background.
*   Be an individual brand logo or combination of logos.
*   Be one of your selected product images.
*   Contain crowded, excessive, poorly cropped or illegible elements.
*   Contain additional text other than text naturally present in the image (such as on product packaging).
*   Contain letterbox or pillar box formats.

See below for image examples and [How to build brand creatives to engage Amazon shoppers](https://advertising.amazon.com/resources/ad-specs/how-to-build-brand-creatives-to-engage-amazon-shoppers?ref_=a20m_us_spcs_cap_bcag) for more information.

### 2.0 Advertising copy

Ads must be clear and accurate so that customers receive correct information before engaging with an ad or deciding to purchase a product.

### 2.1 Call To Action (CTA)

CTA is the portion of the ad that prompts customers to take a suggested action. A clear and direct CTA helps improve the performance of your ads by setting customer expectation for the landing page experience.  
  
All desktop ads running onsite and Fire device ads require a CTA. A CTA is encouraged on mobile but not required if the experience on the landing page is already clear from the ad.  
  
When used, the CTA must contain no end punctuation. If the content that you are linking to requires a subscription, this must be made explicit either in the CTA or elsewhere in the creative.  
  
We do not require the CTA to be present throughout animated ads but it must be in the final frame.  
  
A list of pre-approved CTAs can be found [here](https://advertising.amazon.com/resources/ad-policy/creative-acceptance/pre-approved-ctas?ref_=a20m_us_spcs_cap_spcs_cta).

Additional CTA requirements per ad product

*   [e-commerce ads](https://advertising.amazon.com/resources/ad-specs/ecommerce?ref_=a20m_us_spcs_cap_spcs_ecm)
*   [Mobile on Amazon](https://advertising.amazon.com/resources/ad-specs/mobile-shopping?ref_=a20m_us_spcs_cap_spcs)
*   [Non-standard media](https://advertising.amazon.com/resources/ad-specs/custom-media?ref_=a20m_us_spcs_cap_spcs_nsm)

### 2.2 Claims and substantiation

Advertising claims must be accurate, truthful and substantiated.  
  
The following information must be included either in the disclosure section of the ad text or on the landing page (the data used must be from a reputable source and cannot be more than 18 months old):

*   Awards: The name of the award provider, and the year of the award.
*   Survey results: The source and date of the survey.
*   Statistical claims: The source and date of the study.
*   Superlative and comparative claims: An independent source that supports the claim, and the date of the study.
*   Environmental claims: An independent source that supports the claim, and the date of the study.

If a product shot includes substantiation for a claim, Amazon does not require additional substantiation.

#### 2.2.1 Prices and saving claims

To ensure accuracy, price/savings claims must be communicated via dynamic e-commerce ads (DEA) when these are available for the given ad size. In line with this requirement, DEAs must not include a price or savings claim in the static portion of the ad.  
  
JP: Starting on 1 April 2021, pricing claims must include the consumption tax. For example, when a product price is JPY 1,000, “JPY 1,100 including 10% consumption tax of JPY 100” is approved, but JPY 1,000 (without the consumption tax) is not approved.  
  
Pricing and saving claims must:

*   Be consistent across the ad and the landing page. If the ad promotes a percentage savings (for example, “10% off”), the landing page must also reference the percentage saving, not only the dollar saving. If the claim on the ad becomes inaccurate due to dynamic pricing on the landing page, creatives must be paused and updated to use qualified claims. For example, Save $XX or more, Save up to XX%.
*   Clarify when the amount varies across multiple promoted products (for example, “Save up to X% on selected products”).
*   Be used in the correct context. For example, use phrases such as “limited-time offer” for time-bound savings claims.
*   Use seasonal claims during the relevant promotional period only. For example, “Back to school offers” or “Valentine’s Day Special Prices” are only acceptable during the periods leading up to the beginning of the school year or Valentine’s Day.
*   Be provided to customers upfront. Customers do not have to complete trivial tasks such as in-banner games, quizzes or surveys to be eligible for a special offer.
*   (AU/NZ) Identify any unavoidable additional charges.
*   (AU/NZ) Not be 'bait advertising' (i.e. must be able to be supplied for the time period identified or a reasonable time and a reasonable quantity of the advertised products must be available unless otherwise clearly stated).

**Travel ads  
**Prices in ads for travel services must always be given as “from $X” due to the likelihood of price fluctuations. For example, “Fly to Dublin from £40” rather than “Fly to Dublin for £40”.

### 2.3 Comparative advertising

Ads on Amazon cannot explicitly call out your competitors. Ads may include references to a “leading brand” or another generic phrasing.  
  
Ads off Amazon can use comparisons with named competitors if they do not criticise or attack the competitors.  
  
For ads in Denmark, referencing a “leading brand” is not permitted if that brand is obvious within the respective industry.

### 2.4 Customer reviews and ratings

#### 2.4.1 Customer reviews

Customer reviews sourced from third parties are prohibited. You may use editorial and expert reviews (for example, a quote from a national news outlet) if the source of the review is identified in the ad.  
  
When permitted, customer reviews must:

*   Be genuine and not induced or paid.
*   Relate to the specific product advertised (for example, you cannot use a customer review for a 16 GB version of a smartphone in an ad for the 32 GB version).
*   Be discoverable from the landing page (either because they are present on the product detail page or by clicking on “See all reviews”).
*   Not be changed, including the correction of grammatical errors (but you must avoid reviews with gross misspellings or significant grammatical errors).

*   Truncations must not alter the meaning of the review.
*   Omissions to portions of customer reviews are permissible through the use of ellipses (“…”) with no spaces before or after.

*   Ellipses in customer review headlines may only be used at the beginning or the end of the headline, not in the middle.
*   Aside from headlines, we permit a maximum of three ellipses: one at the start of the review, one in the middle (except for headlines, see the bullet below) and one at the end.

*   Not compare the product promoted to a competing product by name.
*   Not contain references to medical conditions, profanities, emojis or other special characters.

Customer review quotes are supported in Dynamic e-commerce ads (see specs and guidelines [here](https://advertising.amazon.com/en-us/resources/ad-specs/ecommerce?ref_=a20m_us_spcs_cap_spcs_ecm)).

#### 2.4.2 Star ratings

Ads can only include Amazon star ratings. Third-party star ratings are prohibited.  
  
To include a star rating in an ad, the product must have i) at least 15 customer reviews, and ii) a minimum average star rating of 3.5. For Automotive campaigns only, we can allow a star rating based on i) at least eight customer reviews and ii) a minimum star rating of 4.  
  
For mobile and desktop ads, star ratings may only be used within e-commerce creative to ensure that the information is up to date.  
  
For Fire devices and video ads, static star ratings are permitted but must be date-stamped. Your campaign cannot run for more than three months with the same star rating to avoid stale data.

### 2.5 Disclosures

Disclosures must be accurate, legible (both in size and contrast with the background of the ad) and understandable to the average customer.  
  
Except for Homepages, manual scrolling bars (but not automatic scrolling bars) are permitted on desktop placements (not mobile).  
  
Disclosures must meet the specifications listed below (see “Minimum Font Sizes”), and in our [ad specs](https://advertising.amazon.com/en-us/resources/ad-specs?ref_=a20m_us_spcs_cap_spcs).

### 2.6 Editorial guidelines

Ads must be clean, grammatically correct and professional just like the rest of the content on Amazon properties. The following are prohibited on all ads.  
  
Misspellings and grammatical errors such as a wrong verb tense. Slang or wordplay (such as “Cuz” as opposed to “Because”) may be permitted if otherwise compliant with these policies.  
  
Random capitalisation (such as “QUALITY HeadPhones”), except for common abbreviations or trademarks, is prohibited.  
  
Improper punctuation, such as repeated questions or exclamation marks (“!!!”).  
  
Special characters such as @@, ###, emojis, except when part of the advertiser’s logo or included on the product image. Hashtags (#) are permitted if they do not contain inappropriate content (for example, #\[profanity\]).  
  
Ad copy that uses personalised language (such as “you/your”) that may be perceived by a customer as if you are addressing him/her directly and that may cause customer discomfort. For example, ad copy reading “Use our product to solve for your incontinence problems” or “You are overweight. Use our dietary supplement”.  
  
Ad copy that acknowledges or implies the targeting criteria used for the campaign. For example, an ad copy reading “Did you enjoy your recent purchase of \[product\]? Try our newest model”.  
  
Inconsistency between ad copy and landing page. You must present the same offer or product both in your ad copy and on your landing page. For example, we would prohibit ad copy reading “Save on household supplies” with an image of a dish soap leading to a landing page that features vacuum cleaners.  
  
Ads must not promote the sale of products that are out-of-stock, back-ordered or under recall, or services that are unavailable for purchase at the time that the campaign runs. Ads must be paused when the product or service promoted becomes unavailable. Ads for products that are only available for pre-order are permitted if this is clear in the ad, for example, by using a “pre-order” call to action (CTA).  
  
Landing pages consisting solely of a sign-up/registration form. Your landing page should expand on your ad’s message and provide a satisfactory experience before the customer is forced to enter his/her info to find out more. For example, we prohibit landing pages that consists solely of a form to collect contact information.  
  
Interactive ad elements that are not appropriately placed. Inappropriately placed interactive elements such as call to action (CTA) buttons, sliders or video playback buttons can cause customer discomfort. For example, we prohibit placing a CTA button over a model’s breasts or a slider over a gruesome image.

### 2.7 Free offers

When free products or services promoted are dependent on a purchase (for example, a free case with the purchase of a mobile phone), you must indicate that terms and conditions apply in your ad copy. The terms and conditions, or a link to terms and conditions, must be clearly presented in the ad close to the offer.  
  
The landing page must prominently present the free offer advertised.

### 2.8 Language

Ads must be in the primary language of the site on which they appear.  
  
Ads in a foreign language may be permitted if targeted to customers that are physically located in another country or based on the customer’s language setting preferences, with the exceptions listed below.

Fire TV

Ads must be in the primary language of the country in which the content is streaming. For example, in the US all Fire TV ads must be in English.

Ads with more than one language

You must comply with local language requirements in all of the locales where your ads will show, including the following:

*   France: All ad copy must be in French unless a translation accompanies it in the ad.
*   Canada: Ads on Amazon boxes and Prime Now bags must be in both English and French.
*   Japan: CTAs can use English words if the English words are understandable for general customers. For example, “Shop now” or “Watch video”.

The following must always be in the ad’s primary language: call to action (CTA), disclosures, pricing information, product description, promotional messages.

### 2.9 Font sizes and maximum word count

Ads display on many different screen types and sizes. Minimum font sizes and word count requirements ensure that text in ads is readable on screens of varying type, size and resolution. Please review the [ad specs](https://advertising.amazon.com/resources/ad-specs?ref_=a20m_us_spcs_cap_spcs) for more details.  
  
Ads must be legible. The text must be big enough to be readable to the average customer. Ads cannot use the same or similar colour for text and background because the text will not be legible (for example, white text on light grey background).  
  
We require the following font sizes for standard desktop and mobile ad units.  
  
Latin alphabet

|     | **Desktop** | **Mobile** | **Tablet** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Ad copy** | Between Arial 12 and 25pt or equivalent | Minimum 16pt Arial or equivalent (@2x resolution) | Between 32 and 50pt Arial or equivalent (@2x resolution) |

Japanese

|     | **Desktop** | **Mobile** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Ad copy** | Between 9.5 and 45pt UD Shin Go or equivalent | 640 × 100: Minimum 16pt UD Shin Go or equivalent (@2x resolution)  <br>  <br>600 × 500: Between 16 and 90pt UD Shin Go or equivalent (@2x resolution)  <br>  <br>1242 × 375: Minimum 40pt UD Shin Go or equivalent (@3x resolution) |

The following placements or formats have specific font size or word count requirements:

### 2.10 Pressuring language

Amazon prohibits pressuring language to avoid creating a sense of urgency which may be disruptive to the customer’s shopping experience.  
  
Ads must engage customers without appearing to shout at or pressure them.  
  
Ads must not contain:

*   Pressuring language that creates a sense of urgency (for example “Hurry while supplies last”)
*   Repeated exclamation or question marks (for example, “!!!”)
*   Any end punctuation in calls to action (for example, “Shop now!”, or “Find out more?”)
*   Any combination of two or more of the following elements: copy in ALL CAPS, punctuation marks, large font sizes (for example, “UNMISSABLE SUMMER DEALS!”).

### 3.0 Amazon brand elements

Ads must not mimic Amazon content. Any uses of Amazon trademarks, or other references to Amazon or its products must comply with the [Brand Usage Guidelines](https://advertising.amazon.com/resources/ad-policy/brand-usage?ref_=a20m_us_spcs_cap_spcs_brdusg).  
  
We prohibit the use of “Amazon’s Choice”, “Amazon Best Seller” and Amazon ranking in static ads because these elements refresh frequently and may not remain accurate for the duration of the campaign.

### 4.0 Animation and video

Ads must comply with [ad specs requirements](https://advertising.amazon.com/resources/ad-specs?ref_=a20m_us_spcs_cap_spcs) for animated ads and video ads.

#### Animated ads

*   Maximum animation length for on-site placements: 15 seconds (30 seconds in France).

*   For Amazon DSP ads not on Amazon, the maximum is 30 seconds.

*   Initial animation can loop a maximum of three times within the animation length specified above (15 or 30 seconds).
*   Please see the [Amazon DSP mobile app banner ads specs](https://advertising.amazon.com/en-us/resources/ad-specs/dsp/mobile-banners?ref_=a20m_us_spcs_cap_spcs_dsp_mblbn) and [e-commerce creative](https://advertising.amazon.com/resources/ad-specs/ecommerce?ref_=a20m_us_spcs_cap_spcs_ecm) for supported animated ads on those placements.
*   Brazil: animation is prohibited in ads for products designed for children (for example, a school bag, game or toy).

#### Video ads

##### Autoplay

*   Play/Pause, Stop and Mute buttons are required for video longer than 15 seconds.
*   Video stream length:

*   Standard IAB Ad unit: up to 15 seconds.
*   Video ads (on Amazon): up to three minutes (we recommend 30 seconds or less).
*   Video ads on Fire tablet: up to 15 seconds.
*   Amazon DSP video: at least five seconds.

*   Audio must be customer-initiated on click or tap (meaning that autoplay ads must begin muted).

*   The use of rollovers to initiate audio is prohibited.
*   When audio is switched on by the customer, a mute button is required.
*   Video ads (on Amazon) without sound are permitted, but only if the video can be understood without sound.

*   Alcohol ads must comply with any necessary locale specific requirements, as set out in [7.1](#alcohol).

#### Customer-initiated video ads

*   Maximum video stream length and audio served in conjunction with a video stream: three minutes.

### 5.0 Prohibited content

Content prohibited for all ads

*   Children in adult or dangerous situations. For example, ads must not show children close to, or handling, firearms or other weapons, or in situations which may contravene established child safety best practices (such as children in vehicles without their seat belts fastened or cycling without helmets) or without adult supervision in places or situations where they cannot safely look after themselves (such as swimming pools, crossing busy roads or around dangerous equipment).
