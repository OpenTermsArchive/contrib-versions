Amazon Ads policies
===================

Learn about Amazon Ads policies to ensure that your advertisements comply with guidelines and maintain customer trust while achieving your marketing objectives.

Our policies are designed to help advertisers connect with their audiences, while providing customers with high quality, trustworthy ads. It's your responsibility as an advertiser to make sure that your ads comply with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, and industry standards in the geographical areas where your advertisements appear. Our policies aren’t legal advice. It's your responsibility to consult with legal counsel if you have questions about the laws and regulations concerning your ads.

These global ad policies apply to all Amazon Ads unless otherwise noted. This is inclusive of Amazon owned and operated (O&O) properties such as **Amazon store** and **Prime Video Display** as well as **Open Internet** supply.

All advertisements are subject to review. Amazon reserves the right to decline, require modification of, and take-down without prior notice of any ad or campaign for any reason. Amazon may suspend or terminate your ads accounts for severe or repeated ad policy violations. We periodically update our policies, so we recommend revisiting our policy pages often to ensure that you’re always up to date (review [change log](https://advertising.amazon.com/help/G8X8M375UPCN4UUC)).
