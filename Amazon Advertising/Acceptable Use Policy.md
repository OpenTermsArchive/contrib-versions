Overview of Amazon Ads Guidelines and Acceptance Policies
=========================================================

Ads must comply with all necessary Amazon ad guidelines and acceptance policies.

At Amazon Ads, we believe maintaining a high customer experience bar for the ads we serve helps us drive better results for you, our advertisers. Accordingly, we’ve set customer-centric Ad Policies to help preserve and enhance that experience. All advertising content must be appropriate for a general audience and/or for the type of placement in which it will be displayed, and, as an advertiser using Amazon Ads, it is your responsibility to make sure that both you and your ads comply with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, and industry standards in each geographical area where the advertisements may appear(example: adhering to the requirements of the [CAP Code](https://www.asa.org.uk/codes-and-rulings/advertising-codes.html) if your advertisements are targeting UK consumers).

Ads may not:

* Misrepresent the products or services being promoted and may not mislead customers.
* Contain content that is offensive, abusive, intolerant, or harassing.

Amazon customers represent a wide array of genders, races, ethnicities, abilities, ages, religions, sexual orientations and backgrounds.

We encourage you to use diverse imagery within your Ads. Our policies are not intended as legal advice. We encourage you to consult with your legal advisor if you have questions about the laws and regulations concerning your ads.

These ad policies apply to Amazon’s global Display Advertising business, for placements anywhere Amazon’s owned-and-operated properties are there. Separate Ad Policies apply to [sponsored ads](https://advertising.amazon.com/help/G2NN8D3LSUR9V9EA), [Book Ads](https://advertising.amazon.com/help/G5RLASA28TP9TFXZ), [Stores](https://advertising.amazon.com/help/G8VBQRVE9TXSAL8U), and [Streaming TV](https://advertising.amazon.com/help/G756T56KFEER7EBH). For technical requirements, please review the [ad specs](https://advertising.amazon.com/resources/ad-specs?ref_=a20m_us_spcs_cap_spcs).

Amazon reserves the right to reject, remove or request modifications to an ad in its sole discretion, for any reason. Amazon may suspend or terminate your ad account(s) for severe or repeated Ad Policy violations. All examples are illustrative, and Amazon reserves the right to reject campaigns which do not meet its policies as determined in its sole discretion. For those policies that require prior approval by Amazon, please engage your appropriate client support team.

We periodically update our policies. You should revisit our policy pages often to ensure that you’re always up to date on our latest policy requirements.

Note: We refer to advertisers as &quot;you/your,&quot; to ad placements anywhere on Amazon&#x27;s owned-and-operated properties and Amazon DSP offsite.
