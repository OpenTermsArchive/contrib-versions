3\. For What Purposes Does Amazon Europe Process Your Personal Information?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

_**We process your personal information to operate, provide, and improve the Amazon Services that we offer our customers. These purposes include:**_

*   **Purchase and delivery of products and services.** We use your personal information to take and handle orders, deliver products and services, process payments, and communicate with you about orders, products and services, and promotional offers.
*   **Provide, troubleshoot, and improve Amazon Services.** We use your personal information to provide functionality, analyse performance, fix errors, and improve usability and effectiveness of the Amazon Services.
*   **Recommendations and personalisation.** We use your personal information to recommend features, products, and services that might be of interest to you, identify your preferences, and personalise your experience with Amazon Services.
*   **Provide voice, image and camera services**. When you use our voice, image and camera services, we process your voice input, images, videos, and other personal information to respond to your requests, provide the requested service to you, and improve our Amazon services. For more information about Alexa voice services click [here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=GA7E98TJFEJLYSFR).
*   **Comply with legal obligations.** In certain cases, we collect and use your personal information to comply with laws. For instance, we collect from sellers information regarding place of establishment and bank account information for identity verification and other purposes.
*   **Communicate with you.** We use your personal information to communicate with you in relation to Amazon Services via different channels (e.g., by phone, email, chat).
*   **Advertising.** We use your personal information to display interest-based ads for features, products, and services that might be of interest to you. To learn more, please read our [Interest-Based Ads notice](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/BIT/InternetBasedAds).

*   **Purposes for which we seek your consent.** We may also ask for your consent to process your personal information for a specific purpose that we communicate to you. When you consent to our processing your personal information for a specified purpose, you may withdraw your consent at any time and we will stop processing of your data for that purpose.

4\. What About Cookies and Other Identifiers?
---------------------------------------------

We use cookies and similar tools to enhance your shopping experience, provide our services, understand how customers use our services so we can make improvements, and display ads. Approved third parties also use these tools in connection with our display of ads. To enable our systems to recognise your browser or device and to provide Amazon Services to you, we use cookies. For more information about cookies and how we use them, please read our [Cookies Notice](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=201890250). You can manage your cookie preferences [here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/cookieprefs?ref_=cookies_notice_cpp).

5\. Does Amazon Europe Share Your Personal Information?
-------------------------------------------------------

Information about our customers is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of selling our customers' personal information to others. Amazon Europe shares customers' personal information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc. and the subsidiaries that Amazon.com, Inc. controls that are either subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.

*   **Transactions involving third parties:** We make available to you services, products, applications, or skills provided by third parties for use on or through Amazon Services. For example, you can order products from third parties through our stores, download applications from third-party application providers from our App Store, and enable third-party skills through our Alexa services. We also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party businesses, such as co-branded credit cards. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions and we share customer personal information related to those transactions with that third party.
*   **Third party service providers:** We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing payments, transmitting content, assessing and managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These third-party service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable data protection laws.
*   **Business transfers:** As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon.com, Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
*   **Protection of Amazon Europe and others:** We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of Amazon Europe, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
*   Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal information about you might be shared with third parties and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

**Transfers out of the European Economic Area and the UK.** Whenever we transfer personal information to countries outside of the European Economic Area or the UK, we ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by the applicable laws on data protection. We rely on European Commission adequacy decisions or use contracts with standard safeguards published by the European Commission (you can ask [Customer Service](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/contact-us/general-questions.html) for a copy of these) and similar measures under UK laws for such transfers.

6\. How Secure is Information About Me?
---------------------------------------

We design our systems with your security and privacy in mind.

*   We work to protect the security of your personal information during transmission by using encryption protocols and software.
*   We follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) when handling credit card data.
*   We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of personal customer information. Our security procedures mean that we may ask you to verify your identity before we disclose personal information to you.
*   Our devices offer security features to protect them against unauthorised access and loss of data. You can control these features and configure them based on your needs. Click [here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200127470) for more information on how to manage the security settings of your device.
*   It is important for you to protect against unauthorised access to your password and to your computers, devices, and applications. We recommend using a unique password for your Amazon account that is not utilized for other online accounts. Be sure to sign off when you finish using a shared computer. For more information on how to sign off [click here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201945460).

7\. What About Advertising?
---------------------------

*   **Third-party advertisers and links to other websites:** Amazon Services may include third-party advertising and links to other websites and apps. Third party advertising partners may collect information about you when you interact with their content, advertising, and services. For more information about third-party advertising at Amazon Europe, including interest-based ads, please read our [Interest-Based Ads notice](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/BIT/InternetBasedAds). To adjust your advertising preferences, please go to the [Advertising Preferences](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/advertising/oo) page.
*   **Use of third-party advertising services:** We provide ad companies with information that allows them to serve you with more useful and relevant Amazon ads and to measure their effectiveness. We never share your name or other information that directly identifies you when we do this. Instead, we use an advertising identifier like a cookie or other device identifier. For example, if you have already downloaded one of our apps, we will share your advertising identifier and data about that event so that you will not be served an ad to download the app again. Some ad companies also use this information to serve you relevant ads from other advertisers. You can learn more about how to opt-out of interest-based advertising by going to the [Advertising Preferences](https://www.amazon.co.uk/adprefs) page.

8\. What Information Can I Access?

9\. What Choices Do I Have?
---------------------------

If you have any questions or objection as to how we collect and process your personal information, please contact our [Customer Service](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/contact-us/general-questions.html) (https://www.amazon.co.uk/contact-us).

*   As described above, you can choose not to provide certain information but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of the Amazon Services.
*   You can add or update certain information on pages such as those referenced in the [Information You Can Access?](#GUID-A440AA65-7F7E-4134-8FA8-842156F43EEE__SECTION_6B0CF7FB277A4B7D9F5012054476A3C2) section. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the previous version for our records.
*   If you don't want to receive e-mail or other communications from us, please adjust your [Customer Communication Preferences](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/gss/ccp). If you don't want to receive in-app notifications from us, please adjust your notification settings in the app or your device.
*   If you don't want to see interest based-ads, please adjust your [Advertising Preferences](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/advertising/oo).
*   The Help feature on most browsers and devices will tell you how to prevent your browser or device from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie or how to disable cookies altogether. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some essential features of Amazon Services, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Basket, proceed to Checkout, or use any Amazon Services that require you to Sign in. For more information about cookies, see our [Cookies Notice](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/BIT/InternetBasedAds).
*   You can consent to or withdraw consent from third party advertising cookies [here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/cookieprefs/partners)
*   If you want to browse our websites without linking browsing activity to your account, you may do so by logging out of your account [here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201945460) and disabling cookies on your browser.
*   You can manage the recommendations you receive in our store [here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/yourstore/iyr/), remove recommendations you don't want to see [here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/yourstore/home) (select a recommendations tile for products you have not previously purchased, select View All and Manage, then select the Remove Items toggle), and edit your browsing history [here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/yourstore/pym/cc/).
*   When you consent to our processing your personal information for a specified purpose, you may withdraw your consent at any time and we will stop any further processing of your data for that purpose.
*   You will also be able to opt out of certain other types of data processing by updating your settings on the applicable Amazon website (e.g., in "Manage Your Content and Devices"), device, or application. For more information click [here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GQFYXZHZB2H629WN).

For most devices, these controls are located in the device's settings menu. If you have questions about how to change your device permissions on devices manufactured by third parties, we recommend you contact your mobile service carrier or your device manufacturer as different devices may have different permission settings.
*   If you are a seller, you can add or update certain information in [Seller Central](https://sellercentral.amazon.co.uk/gp/homepage.html?ld=AZUKSOAFooter), update your account information by accessing your [Seller Account Information](https://sellercentral.amazon.co.uk/gp/homepage.html?ld=AZUKSOAFooter), and adjust the email or other communications you receive from us by updating your [Notification Preferences](https://services.amazon.co.uk/standards/privacy-notice.html).

In addition, subject to applicable law, you have the right to request access to, correct, and delete your personal data, and to ask for data portability. You may also object to our processing of your personal data or ask that we restrict the processing of your personal data in certain instances. If you wish to do any of these things, please contact [Customer Service](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/contact-us/general-questions.html) (https://www.amazon.co.uk/contact-us) or, to submit a data subject access request, go [here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/privacycentral/dsar/preview.html) (https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/privacycentral/dsar/preview.html).

-------------------------------------------------

Amazon Europe doesn't sell products for purchase by children. We sell children's products for purchase by adults. If you're under 18, you may use Amazon Services only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.

11\. How Long Do We Keep Your Personal Information?
---------------------------------------------------

We keep your personal information to enable your continued use of Amazon Services, for as long as it is required in order to fulfil the relevant purposes described in this Privacy Notice, as may be required by law such as for tax and accounting purposes, or as otherwise communicated to you. For example, we retain your transaction history so that you can review past purchases (and repeat orders if desired) and what addresses you have shipped orders to, and to improve the relevancy of products and content we recommend.

12\. EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield
--------------------------------------

**_We do not rely on the Privacy Shield but continue to keep to the commitments below that we made when we certified to the Privacy Shield._**

Amazon.com, Inc. and certain of its controlled US affiliates (together, the Amazon Group Companies, or "We") participate in the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland. We have certified with the Department of Commerce that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Principles, see [here](#GUID-A440AA65-7F7E-4134-8FA8-842156F43EEE__SECTION_876D9190E60A4BD0BC96744F4CCCC0BF).

If you have any inquiries or complaints about our handling of your personal information under Privacy Shield, or about our privacy practices generally, please contact us at: privacyshield@amazon.com. We will respond to your inquiry promptly. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request. If neither Amazon nor our provider resolves your complaint, you may pursue binding arbitration through the Privacy Shield Panel. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Panel, see [here](https://www.commerce.gov/tags/eu-us-privacy-shield).

As explained here we sometimes provide personal information to third parties to perform services on our behalf. If we transfer personal information received under the Privacy Shield to a third party, the third party's access, use, and disclosure of the personal information must also be in compliance with our Privacy Shield obligations, and we will remain liable under the Privacy Shield for any failure to do so by the third party unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

You can review our Privacy Shield registration [here](https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TOWQAA4&status=Active). The Amazon Group Companies are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). We may be required to disclose personal information that we handle under the Privacy Shield in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

13\. EU General Data Protection Regulation and UK Data Protection Laws - Legal Basis
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The EU GDPR and UK data protection laws require a legal basis for our use of personal information. Our basis varies depending on the specific purpose for which we use personal information. We use:

*   **Performance of a contract** when we provide you with products or services, or communicate with you about them. This includes when we use your personal information to take and handle orders, deliver products and services, and process payments.
*   **Our legitimate business interests and the interests of our customers** when we improve Amazon services (including when we use your voice, video, or camera input to improve services), when we detect and prevent fraud and abuse in order to protect the security of our customers, ourselves, or others, and when we provide you with interest-based advertising.
*   **Your consent** when we ask for your consent to process your personal information for a specific purpose that we communicate to you. When you consent to our processing your personal information for a specified purpose, you may withdraw your consent at any time and we will stop processing of your data for that purpose.
*   **Compliance with a legal obligation** when we use your personal information to comply with laws. For instance, we collect seller place of establishment and bank account information for identity verification purposes.
*   **These and other legal bases** depending on the purpose for which we use personal information.
