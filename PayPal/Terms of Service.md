PayPal’s main business is the issuance of electronic money and the provision of payment services using that electronic money. Through our services you may make online and in-store payments, donations, and send, request and receive electronic money. PayPal also provides other financial and related services which can be found on the Legal Agreements page for PayPal services. These services are collectively referred to as the service.

This user agreement, together with other legal terms and legally required disclosures relating to your use of our service will be made available to you at all times on the PayPal website (typically located on the “Legal Agreements” page). We may also send this information to you.

You may request a copy of any legally required disclosures (including this user agreement) from us and we will provide this to you in a form which allows you to store and reproduce the information (for example, by e-mail).

### What do you need to use the PayPal service?

To use our service, you will need access to a smartphone and computer, or tablet and have an internet connection.

Opening an account
------------------

We offer 2 types of accounts: personal accounts and business accounts. To open an account with us, you must:

* Either be an individual (at least 18 years old) or a business that is able to form a legally binding contract; and
* Complete our sign-up process.

As part of our sign-up process, you must:

* Register an email address and mobile number;
* Set a password, which we will use to log you in;
* Meet our eligibility requirements; and
* Agree to our [Privacy Statement](https://www.paypal.com/legalhub/privacy-full) and [user agreement](https://www.paypal.com/legalhub/useragreement-full), including the applicable documents on the Legal Agreements page.

#### Personal accounts

With a personal account you can send and request money from friends and family and pay online for purchases.

Holders of certain existing personal accounts may be required to upgrade their accounts (which may include providing further information to PayPal) to be able to use all of the current functionality available in a personal account.

To use your PayPal account primarily to sell things, you must open a business account or convert your personal account to a business account.

#### Business accounts

Business accounts are for people and organizations (whether incorporated or not) that primarily use PayPal to receive online payments for sales or donations. Business accounts are not eligible to receive “[personal transactions](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/paypal-fees#statement-4)”.

Business accounts may be subject to fees that differ from the fees applicable to personal accounts. See our [Fees](#tableOfFees1) for further details.

**By opening a business account or converting a personal account to a business account, you certify to us that you are using it primarily for a business or commercial purpose.**

#### Commercial Entity Status

If the activity through any type of PayPal account you hold reaches certain thresholds or involves certain business segments or activities, you are required by the card networks to agree to [Commercial Entity Agreements](https://www.paypal.com/legalhub/ceagreement-full) directly with our processing partners to allow you to continue accepting card-funded payments. In this case, these [Commercial Entity Agreements](https://www.paypal.com/legalhub/ceagreement-full) will apply to any payment processed by PayPal on your behalf in addition to this user agreement.

#### Safe use of your PayPal account

You should take reasonable steps to stop your PayPal account being misused. You must maintain adequate security and control of any and all devices, items, IDs, passwords and personal identification numbers / codes that you use to access your PayPal account and the PayPal services.

You must comply with all reasonable instructions we may issue regarding how you can keep your payment instrument safe.

We may require you to authenticate any instruction relating to your account (i.e. give us the information that we need to be sure that it's you giving us the instruction, such as submitting your correct log-in information – this could include your e-mail address and password) and otherwise successfully log into your PayPal account to provide to us your instruction.

You must keep your postal address, email address, phone number of a phone to which you are the primary user and other contact information current in your PayPal account profile.

You may expressly grant, remove and manage permissions for some third parties to take certain actions on your behalf. In some cases you can do this when logged into your account – in other cases you can do this directly with the third party. You acknowledge that if you grant permission for a third party to take actions on your behalf, we may disclose certain information about your account to this third party.

You may permit third party service providers licensed by applicable law to:

* Provide account information services to access information about your account on your behalf.
* Confirm whether an amount necessary for the execution of a card-based payment transaction is available on your account.
* Provide payment initiation services to initiate payments from your account on your behalf.

Granting permission to any third party to access your account in any way does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under this user agreement. You are liable to us for the actions that you authorize the third parties to carry out. You will not hold us responsible for, and you will indemnify us from, any liability arising from the actions or inactions of such third parties in connection with the permissions you granted, subject to your mandatory legal rights.

Closing Your PayPal Account
---------------------------

You can close your account at any time. See the [PayPal Help Center](https://www.paypal.com/smarthelp/article/how-do-i-close-my-paypal-account-faq1215) for how to do this.

We may close your account at our convenience by providing you with 2 months’ (but no less than 60 days') prior notice. We may also close your account at any time if:

1. You are in breach of this user agreement and/or we are otherwise entitled to close your account under this user agreement.
2. You do not access your account for 3 years.
3. We suspect that your account has been accessed without your authorisation.

Where we decide to close your account we will provide you with notice of account closure and where practicable, the reasons for closing your account, together with the ability to withdraw any undisputed funds that we are holding.

When your account is closed:

* This user agreement terminates immediately, except that this user agreement survives termination to the extent and for so long as we require to deal with the closure of your account and to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
* We may cancel any pending transactions and you will forfeit any balances associated with special funding arrangements.
* We may suspend, limit or terminate your access to or use of our services, websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the services) operated by us or on our behalf or some or all of the services.
* You will remain liable for all outstanding obligations under this user agreement related to your account prior to closure.
* We may keep your account information in our database for the purpose of fulfilling our legal obligations.
* We may retain your electronic money after closure to the extent and for the time we reasonably require to protect us and/or any third party against the risk of reversals, fees, fines, penalties and other liabilities of whatever nature. After this time you will be able to withdraw any undisputed funds that we are holding. Please [Contact Us](https://www.paypal.com/selfhelp/home) if you have any questions about funds held in your account on closure.  
    **If you are the legal representative of an incapacitated or deceased account holder, please** [Contact Us](https://www.paypal.com/selfhelp/home) for assistance.

In the event that we decide to discontinue any of our services or any portion or feature of our services for any reason, we will give you at least two months’ (but no less than 60 days) prior notice before discontinuing the service or feature, unless we determine in good faith that:

* The service or feature must be discontinued sooner as required by law or a third-party relationship.
* Doing so could create a security risk or substantial economic or material technical burden.

#### Right of withdrawal

If you are a consumer, you have the right to withdraw from the User Agreement without giving any reason and without penalty within 14 days of your account being opened. To do so, you must, within these 14 days, follow the process to close your account which will end the User Agreement. PayPal thinks consumers should have the choice to use our services or not so we don’t lock you into a contract. This is why, in addition to these mandatory rights, even after 14 days, you can end your agreement by closing your account. By making use of our services during the 14-day withdrawal period you require our services to be provided before the end of the 14-day right of withdrawal period. You will have to pay fees for the services you used (including during the 14-day withdrawal period) up until you close your account and withdraw your balance, if any. All pending transactions will be cancelled when you close your account. See the section “[Closing your PayPal account](#closing-account)” in the User Agreement for more details.

Linking and Unlinking a Funding Source
--------------------------------------

All money in your account is legally termed “electronic money”, which is recognized throughout the European Economic Area as a form of money suitable for use online.

You can use a funding source as a way to pay us to obtain electronic money in your account or to receive withdrawals from your account, as further outlined in this user agreement (see in particular [Adding or Withdrawing Money](#withdraw1) and [Funding your Payment](#fund-payment1).

You can link or unlink a credit card, debit card, a prepaid card (where available) a bank account or PayPal Credit (where available) to your PayPal account as a funding source.

We may limit the availability of your funding sources to manage our risk.

Please keep your funding source information current (e.g. credit card number and expiration date). If this information changes, we may update it using information and third-party sources available to us without any action on your part. If you do not want us to update your card information, you may contact your issuer to request this or remove your funding source from your PayPal account. If we update your funding source, we will keep any preference setting attached to that funding source. You may choose to confirm your card or bank account, so that we can verify that the card or bank account is valid and that you are its owner. We may allow you to do this by following the "Link and Confirm Card" process (for cards) or the "Bank Confirmation" process (for bank accounts) or other processes which we may notify to you or which we may publish from time to time.

#### Your continuous permission for us to charge your funding sources

By linking a funding source to your PayPal account, you give us continuous permission to automatically charge that funding source (subject to this user agreement and the terms of any mandate (e.g. bank direct debit) used by the provider of that funding source to set up and maintain that authority) for the required value of the electronic money:

* To cover:
    * The payment amount (plus all transaction fees payable to us) when you use your account to send a payment to another user.
    * Any amounts you owe us arising from your activity as a recipient of payments using our services.
* To top up your account when you use the "Add Funds" functionality account interface.

We may charge the funding source again if the previous attempt failed. If you cancel any continuous permission from your funding source, you will reimburse us for the value of any electronic money we've already issued for which a charge from that funding source remains outstanding.

You can stop the permission by unlinking the funding source from your PayPal account.

SEPA is an initiative of the European Commission and European banking sector, aimed at making transactions more efficient within the European Union. If you are a user with a registered address in Cyprus, Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Slovakia and Slovenia, whenever you register a bank account with PayPal or use a new bank account for the first time as a Funding Source, you grant PayPal a SEPA Direct Debit mandate. If you use a SEPA Direct Debit mandate for the continuous authority:

* You can access the mandate and the mandate reference number (MRN) in your PayPal account profile at any time and cancel or change the mandate for future transactions.
* PayPal will inform you of the amount of the SEPA Direct Debit payment and the time frame in which PayPal will collect the amount from the bank account together with the purchase confirmation. If PayPal resubmits any SEPA Direct Debit payment request due to reversal of the original payment, there will be no (additional) information given on the amount and the time frame ahead of the resubmission.
* You can claim a refund from your bank at any time up to 8 weeks after the date on which the SEPA Direct Debit payment took place in accordance with your bank's terms and conditions.

#### Risk of reversals to your funding source and when eCheques may arise

When we receive a payment from your funding source we may store the resulting electronic money in your [reserve account](#holds-limits-reserves1) for as long as we have reason to believe that there is risk of reversal by the funding source provider. This is because we do not have all the information necessary to place the funds from your payment at your disposal in your [PayPal balance](#holding1) while there is such a risk of reversal.

When you instruct us to make a payment from your account to another user funded by a payment from your bank account and we store the resulting electronic money in this way, we call this type of payment from your bank account an “eCheque” payment. See [Funding payments you send from your account](#fund-payment1) below for how we use eCheques.

Holding and using a PayPal balance
----------------------------------

You will not receive interest or any other earnings on the money in your account. This is because the money in your account is electronic money and applicable laws forbid paying interest on electronic money (for example, Directive 2009/110/EC article 12 of the European Union). Also, electronic money is not a deposit or an investment under Luxembourg law, so the Luxembourg deposit guarantee or investor indemnity schemes administered by the _Conseil des Protection des Deposants et des Investisseurs_ or any equivalent scheme in the EEA cannot protect you.

We may store and move the money in your account in and between:

* The [PayPal balance](#holding1) and
* The [reserve account](#holds-limits-reserves1).

at any given time subject further to this user agreement.

#### PayPal balance

The operational part of your account contains your PayPal balance, which is the balance of money available for payments or withdrawals.

When you use our payment service to pay another user, you instruct us to transfer the money from your PayPal balance to the recipient’s account.

You need to have enough PayPal balance in cleared funds to cover the amount of any payment you make and the transaction fees you owe us at the time of the payment. Other requirements also apply – see the section [Making a Payment](#make-payment1) below. If you have insufficient PayPal balance or have chosen a preferred funding source you are also requesting us to obtain funds on your behalf from your applicable funding source and issue electronic money to your PayPal balance for your payment to be made.

When you withdraw your money you need to have enough PayPal balance to cover the value of any withdrawal at the time of the withdrawal.

See [Adding or Withdrawing Money](#withdraw1) to know how to get a PayPal balance and how to withdraw it.

If your PayPal balance shows a negative amount, this is the net amount you owe to us at the given time.

#### Reserve account

Money marked in your account overview as “pending”, “uncleared”, “held” or otherwise restricted or limited at any given time is held in the part of your account which acts as a reserve account. You cannot access and use money stored in the reserve account.

Adding or Withdrawing Money
---------------------------

#### Adding money

To get electronic money into your account you can, subject further to this user agreement:

* Accept a payment in your account from someone else. We may charge you [fees](#tableOfFees1) for this.
* Obtain electronic money from us by paying us an equivalent amount.

You can obtain electronic money from us by:

* Automatically using your applicable funding source(s) to cover the amount of the payments that you instruct us to send to other users (and the transaction fees payable by you to us).
* Manually using the “Add Funds” function available from your account interface to pay us or instructing us to charge your funding source for the electronic money.

The execution of any payment to us from your funding source provider is your funding source provider's legal responsibility. We have no control over how long the payment to us will take.

#### Withdrawing money

If you have a PayPal balance, you may withdraw any amount by transferring it to your nominated funding source linked to your PayPal account, as we may allow from time to time. This could include your bank account or debit or credit card, depending on the country in which your PayPal account is registered.

When you instruct us to withdraw any amount of your PayPal balance, subject further to this user agreement we will:

* Convert the electronic money to money that we can transfer to your nominated funding source.
* Instruct our own bank to transfer that money to your nominated funding source.

We aim to send the withdrawal payment instruction to our bank by the end of the next Business Day (“Business Day” means a day on which banks in Luxembourg are open to the general public). if there are no other delays subject to this user agreement. Once our bank receives our payment instruction, we have no control over how long the payment to you will take to complete. At this point, our bank, your funding source provider and the payment systems that they rely on take over responsibility for getting the money to your nominated funding source and this can affect the time it takes for you to receive your money. We may allow you to withdraw the money by transferring the money to:

* An eligible bank account (where we make this available) through:
    * A standard transfer to your bank account linked to your account (this withdrawal/redemption functionality is sometimes known as “transfer to bank”); or
    * An Instant Transfer to your bank account linked to your account.  
        We may allow the above transfers to be made through the debit card attached to that bank account.
* Your branded MasterCard or Visa card (where we make this available).

[Fees](#tableOfFees1) apply to withdrawals. We will also disclose to you the fees in advance each time you initiate such a withdrawal.

The funding source (for example, bank account or card) into which you request the withdrawal must be denominated in the original opening currency of your account or another currency that PayPal supports for withdrawals in your country of residence.

You may only withdraw PayPal balance in the opening currency of your account, unless we agree otherwise. In order to withdraw PayPal balance held in another currency you will have to convert the currency to the opening currency of your account, or it will be converted for you at the time of your withdrawal. Our transaction exchange rate will be used.

This means that if you withdraw:

* A PayPal balance held in a currency other than the original opening currency of your account, the conversion into your original opening currency will be performed using our [transaction exchange rate](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/paypal-fees).
* To a funding source (for example, bank account or card) denominated in a currency other than the original opening currency of your account, the conversion into the currency in which the funding source is denominated will be performed using our [transaction exchange rate](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/paypal-fees).

Your issuer may also charge you if a currency conversion to the currency your card is issued in, is required.

If you have a business account, this transactions exchange rate will not apply. Instead, you will pay a currency conversion fee applied on an external base exchange rate as described on the Fees Page (see also the "How We Convert Currency" section).

To protect you, our other users and us from loss and to allow us to comply with our anti-money laundering and other legal obligations, we may delay a withdrawal, in certain situations, including if we need to confirm that you have authorized the withdrawal or if payments to your PayPal account have been subject to a reversal (for example, as a result of a chargeback, bank reversal or dispute by a buyer). If we place a [limitation](#holds-limits-reserves1) on your PayPal account, a payment is subject to a hold, or your account or an associated account has a negative balance in any currency while a withdrawal from your PayPal account is pending, you will have to reinitiate the withdrawal once the limitation or hold has been lifted, or negative balance is fully paid off.

We may set limits on your withdrawals, and you can view any withdrawal limit by logging into your PayPal account. You must follow the steps that we will notify to you or publish from time to time (which we may set out in your account overview) to lift your withdrawal limit.

Managing Your Money in Multiple Currencies
------------------------------------------

When you open your account, it is configured for use with the opening currency of your account.

The opening currency of your account is euro (EUR), except as follows for if you are registered with us as resident in one of these countries:

* Czech Republic: Czech koruna (CZK).

You may set the currency on your card.

We may configure your account further so that you can use it to store money and send and receive payments in currencies other than the opening currency of your account. If you hold a PayPal balance, we may allow you to convert it to balance in another currency.

If your PayPal balance is not enough to cover the amount of a payment you instruct us to make in a particular currency, we may perform a currency conversion from any PayPal balance in another currency to cover the shortfall. There may be some restrictions on where you can send payments in certain currencies.

We may allow you to choose the way in which your account treats and/or converts payments received in currencies other than the opening currency of your account. To receive money in a currency other than the opening currency of your account, it may be necessary to create a balance in that currency or convert the money into another currency that we allow you to hold.

Payments in certain currencies can only be received by automatic conversion of the money into another currency that we allow you to hold.

If you receive a payment from anyone who doesn't have a PayPal account and that payment is in a currency which your account is not currently configured to use, we may automatically convert the amount received into a currency that your account is configured to use at the time the payment is made.

Please see the [Withdrawing Money](#withdraw1) section above to see how withdrawals in different currencies can be made.

If one of the currency balances in your account shows that you owe us an amount of funds for any reason, we may set off the amount you owe us by using funds you maintain in a different currency balance or by deducting amounts you owe us from money you receive into your account, or money you attempt to withdraw or send from your account, or in a different account, and by deducting funds from any withdrawals you attempt to make. If, for a period of 21 days, you have a PayPal balance that reflects an amount owing to us that is not in the opening currency of your account, we may convert the amount you owe us to that opening currency.

We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of money you can convert or the number of conversions you can perform. You are responsible for all risks associated with maintaining multiple currencies in a PayPal account. You may not manage or convert currencies for speculative trading purposes, conversion arbitrage, conversion options, or any other activity that we determine is primarily for the purpose of gaining or making money based on currency conversion rates. We may hold, cancel, or reverse any transaction we determine to violate this policy.

#### How we convert currency

Other than as set out below and on the Fees Page, if PayPal converts currency, it will be completed at the transaction exchange rate we set for the relevant currency exchange.

The transaction exchange rate is adjusted regularly, typically between 5pm and 7pm Eastern Standard Time (EST) (in New York City, USA) on every Business Day and those changes will be applied immediately.

You can access a "[Currency Converter](https://www.paypal.com/smarthelp/article/faq1976)" tool to see what transaction exchange rate may apply for certain currency conversions. Any rates shown using the Currency Converter tool indicate the applicable rates at the time you use the tool and are subject to change. Subject to other provisions of the user agreement, when you complete a transaction, the transaction exchange rate applying to the transaction will be shown to you so you can decide to make your payment at that rate or not. In certain circumstances, that transaction exchange rate may apply to the payment for the transaction whenever it is processed; or that rate may be valid only if transaction is processed by the seller within a limited time, as stated prior to the initiation of the transaction. After that limited time, we may use the transaction exchange rate in effect at the time the transaction is processed by the seller, or not perform the currency conversion.

If you have authorized a payment under a billing agreement, and we perform a currency conversion for that payment, we will use the transaction exchange rate in effect at the time the payment transaction is processed by the seller. Therefore, the transaction exchange rate for each payment under a billing agreement may vary.

[**  
Holds or limitations**](#actions-restricted-activities) may delay currency conversion of amounts until such holds or limitations are released. This may result in the application of a currency conversion that is different from the transaction exchange rate that would have been applied had no account hold(s) or limitation(s) been in place. Currency conversions in these circumstances may be more favourable or less favourable to you.

If you are a seller and you have agreed that you will bear the transaction exchange rate rather than the buyer, or if you have a business account and you convert currency in your PayPal account that does not form part of a specific transaction into or out of your account (e.g. converting your balance to another currency), the transaction exchange rate will not apply. Instead, you will pay a currency conversion fee applied on an external base exchange rate, as described on the [Fees Page](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/paypal-fees). The external base exchange rate is based on rates within the wholesale currency markets on the conversion day or the prior Business Day.

#### Currency conversion choices

When your payment is funded by a debit or credit card and PayPal determines currency conversion is necessary, you consent to and authorize us to convert the currency in place of your debit or credit card issuer.

You may have the right to have your card issuer convert the currency of the card payment into the currency in which you send the payment from your PayPal account, if applicable for that card issuer and network. This selection may be presented to you in various forms, including setting the currency of your card, a choice of which currency is used for the transaction, whether we or your card issuer performs the conversion, or which conversion rate is used for the transaction, among others. If your card issuer converts the currency, your card issuer will determine the currency conversion rate and what fees they may charge.

PayPal will always perform the conversion for transactions where you use existing balance or your linked bank account is the funding source.

If PayPal determines currency conversion is necessary for a transaction that also requires a backup funding source to be chosen, you may not be able to separately choose whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the currency conversion on the payment from your backup funding source.

Where a currency conversion is offered at the point of sale by the merchant, not by PayPal, and you choose to authorize the payment transaction on the basis of the merchant's exchange rate and charges, PayPal has no liability to you for that currency conversion.

Taxes and Information Reporting
-------------------------------

#### General information

Our [**consumer fees**](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/paypal-fees) and [**merchant fees**](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees) are exclusive of any taxes, charges, or similar assessments of any nature, including, without limitation, value-added, sales, digital services, stamp, transfer, or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction or governmental authority (collectively, “Taxes”).

Each of us shall be responsible to pay our own Taxes arising in connection with the performance of our respective obligations from your use of PayPal services.

#### Paying for PayPal’s services

If you are paying for a PayPal service, you agree to pay to PayPal the amount of any legally applicable Taxes imposed on any amount due from you to PayPal.

You agree not to withhold any Taxes on amounts payable by you to PayPal unless you are legally required to do so. If you withhold any Taxes, the amount payable by you to PayPal shall not be decreased by the amount withheld. You agree that PayPal is entitled to receive the full amount that would have been received had there been no withholding of any Taxes. Upon request by PayPal, you will deliver to PayPal in a timely manner any written documentation evidencing your payment of Taxes to the relevant authorities.

#### Your additional responsibilities and acknowledgments

It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, Taxes apply to the payments you make or receive, and it is solely your responsibility to assess, collect, report, and remit the correct Taxes to the appropriate authority. PayPal is not responsible for determining whether any Taxes apply to your transaction or for calculating, collecting, reporting, or remitting Taxes arising from any transaction.  

You acknowledge that PayPal may have a legal obligation to make reports, and will make such reports, to tax authorities regarding transactions that we process on your behalf. Additional information can be found in our [**Help Centre**](https://www.paypal.com/cshelp).

#### Information reporting

We may request that you provide PayPal with your tax identification number and/or other tax-related documentation or information. If you do not provide the requested information to PayPal or keep documentation up to date in your PayPal account, you may be subject to account holds or limitations and withholding Taxes at the applicable rates on gross payments received. PayPal will remit any such withholding Taxes to the appropriate tax authorities, and you acknowledge PayPal may be prohibited from refunding any amounts to you once these have been sent to the appropriate tax authorities.

If a currency conversion is required on a payment of withholding Taxes, the amount due to the relevant tax authority will be calculated by PayPal in accordance with [**our currency conversion terms**](#currency-conversion) when we process the withholding Taxes. To minimise risks relating to exchange rate fluctuations, account holds and limitations, tax withholding, and remittance to the relevant tax authority, you should add or confirm your taxpayer information to PayPal.

Account Statements and Requesting Account Records
-------------------------------------------------

Unless your account is restricted you may view and download your PayPal account statement by logging into your PayPal account. You agree to review your transactions through your PayPal account history instead of receiving periodic statements by email.

You will receive important information about your payments and payment receipts by e-mail immediately after a transaction. Your transaction history will also be updated and made available to you at any time by logging into your account. You can also access a downloadable report from your PayPal account. This will show all fees incurred and any other amounts charged to your PayPal account in the relevant period. The report will only be updated and made available if there has been any activity on your PayPal account or any fees have been incurred in the relevant period. The way in which we provide the transaction information will allow you to store and reproduce the information unchanged, for example by printing a copy.

We reserve the right to charge a [fee](#tableOfFees1) for providing you with additional information or for providing the transaction history and other information about [fee](#tableOfFees1)s in a different way but we won’t charge you for records requested in connection with your good-faith assertion of an error in your PayPal account.

Fees
----

We charge fees for our services as set out on the [fees page](#tableOfFees1) relating to the country in which you are registered with us as resident.

You are liable for telephone charges and any charges made by your internet service provider or similar or associated charges as a result of the use by you of our services.  

We may deduct our fees from your PayPal balance. We may deduct our transaction-related fees from the amounts we transfer before those funds are credited to your PayPal balance.

We will provide you with the details of the amounts you receive and our fees charged either by e-mail or in your transaction history (which you can access by logging into your account).

If your payment requires you to pay a fee to us, we will (subject to the rest of the user agreement) disclose that fee to you when you provide your payment instruction to us.

You cannot set off or deduct any amounts from our fees.

We may make a charge for any additional services we provide outside this user agreement. We will tell you of those charges when you ask for the service.
