How We Use Personal Information
-------------------------------

We may process your Personal Information for a variety of reasons, including to provide our Services, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We also use Personal Information to allow you to participate in certain features that may be of interest to you, such as syncing your contact list to your account, personalizing content and offers, targeted advertising, or connecting to a third-party platform. Some of these features may be offered with an opt-out or require your consent to enable. You can withdraw your consent at any time, as described in [Your Data Protection Rights](#data-protection).

We may collect Personal Information to:

*   For Visa+, we will receive the recipient’s name and payment information from Visa and third-party Visa+ participating digital wallets for the purpose of processing and matching Visa+ payment transactions between participating digital wallets and PayPal.
*   If you are using Fastlane, we may recognize you as a Fastlane user when you shop on participating Partner and Merchant sites, and we may prompt you to engage in participating Partner or Merchant interactions, such as registering for a store or loyalty account using your Fastlane profile. We will also use your Personal Information and payment method details to determine whether the payment you are making with a participating Partner or Merchant is authorized by you and likely to be successfully authorized by the payment method you choose to use when you make a purchase using details from your Fastlane profile.

*   _Provide receipts in connection with PayPal Point of Sale (formerly Zettle by PayPal) services._ For buyers using our PayPal Point of Sale services (including Venmo Tap to Pay), you may choose to provide us your contact details so that we can send you digital receipts. If you provide your e-mail address or mobile number to a Partner or Merchant who uses PayPal Point of Sale, we may remember your details for the next time you buy something from a Merchant who uses PayPal Point of Sale in its physical store, if you use the same payment card. This is regardless of whether you have previously bought something from this Merchant or not. This means that your e-mail address or mobile number will be pre-filled in the receipt view for your convenience the next time you buy something from a Merchant who uses PayPal Point of Sale in its physical store.
*   _Manage, analyze and improve our Services._ We may use Personal Information to develop new products and features, to administer our Services, to promote the safety and security of the Services, for customer analysis and internal operations (e.g., for troubleshooting) and procedures, data analysis, testing, research, and statistical purposes. We may also use your transaction and experience data on an aggregated basis to generate business insights. We may share those insights with third parties such as our Partners and Merchants to help improve their products and services.
*   _AI and Automated Decision Making_. We may use Personal Information to train our artificial intelligence (AI) models that power our Services and help us deliver more secure, efficient, and personalized services. PayPal also uses Automated Decision Making to provide our products and Services, conduct risk analysis, fraud prevention and risk management to protect our customers and business, including to prevent fraud against our Partners and Merchants and strategic ventures. Please see [AI and Automated Decision Making](#ai) to learn more.
*   _Manage your creditworthiness_. Pursuant to applicable law, we will use and exchange Personal Information about you with CRAs to assess creditworthiness and product suitability, check your identity, trace and recover debts, and prevent fraud and criminal activity. This information may be supplied by CRAs to other organizations to perform similar checks and to trace your whereabouts and recover debts that you owe.
*   _Associate information about you._ If you use our Services without a PayPal Account, we may associate such transactions with your PayPal account if you later establish an account. If you use one of the following—Fastlane, Venmo, and PayPal Honey—we may associate information about your transactions and experiences using these Services to personalize content and offers and improve your use of the PayPal Services.
*   _Market our Services_. We may use Personal Information to provide you with information, news, and market our Services including where we partner with others to offer similar services to market about our Partners and Merchants.

We may use Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and rules (including anti-money laundering (“**AML**”), bookkeeping laws and rules issued by our designated banks and relevant card networks, and know-your-customer (“**KYC**”)), enforce our agreements with you and other people who use our Services, and establish, and exercise or defend a legal claim or collection procedure. We also carry out sanction screening, report to tax authorities, police and other enforcement authorities, supervisory authorities where we are not compelled by applicable laws but where we have a good faith belief that sharing the information is necessary to comply with applicable law. Further, we will conduct financial risk management, such as credit performance and quality, assess product suitability, check your identity, trace and recover debts, prevent criminal activity, fraud and scams, mitigate insurance risks, and support compliance with capital adequacy requirements under applicable law.
*   _Process information about your contacts_. We may use Personal Information in order to make it easy for you to find and connect your contacts, improve payment accuracy and suggest connections with people you may know. **By providing us with information about your contacts you certify that you have permission to provide that information to PayPal for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement.**
*   _Create an account connection between your account and a third-party account or platform_. We may use Personal Information to connect with a third-party account, such as your social network account to facilitate payment transactions or a financial institution when you link an account to PayPal or link your PayPal account to another financial institution, directly or through the use of an aggregator.
*   _Send you locally relevant options and for security_. If you agree to let us track your precise geolocation, we can customize our Services by personalizing language and content such as providing location-based options, functionality or offers, ads and search results. Even if you don’t allow us to track your precise location, we may still use your address to send you location-based options recommended by businesses that are near your address. In addition, we will use precise geolocation to enhance the security of the Sites and Services. We collect precise geolocation data from Users while they are logged into their financial account.

For payment transactions, your Personal Information will be shared with the provider of the payment services for the participating Partner and Merchant to enable the processing of the payment transaction. The payment provider for the Partner and Merchant may be PayPal or a third party payment provider.
*   **Fraud prevention and identity verification agencies**. We may disclose Personal Information with fraud prevention and identity verification agencies and other companies across industries to assist in detecting activities suggestive of fraud.
*   **Credit reporting and debt collection agencies**. We may disclose Personal Information with such agencies to collect unpaid overdue debts through a third party such as a debt collection agency. Please be aware that these parties’ privacy notices apply to the processing of Personal Information that you share directly with them, and they may report your unpaid debts to CRAs which may affect your creditworthiness or ability to secure future credit.
*   **Other PayPal account holders to complete a transaction**. We may disclose Personal Information with other PayPal account holders to complete a payment transaction, where necessary. This also applies when you interact with ads or offers we provide relating to one of our Partners and Merchants. The Personal Information that may be shared with other PayPal account holders includes your username, profile photo, first and last name, email, city, and phone number in accordance with your account settings.
*   **Other Users in accordance with your account settings**. In accordance with your [account settings](https://www.paypal.com/us/myaccount/privacy/profiles/search) or PayPal.Me preferences, your Personal Information can be seen by other account holders (such as users of Venmo or third party payment networks and processors) to help facilitate a transaction.

For example, when you use the Services to initiate online purchases, save your payment information with Fastlane, pay other Users using the Services, pay recipients using Visa+, return goods, or when you participate in transactions through the payment network, we may disclose information about you and your account or Fastlane profile with the other parties (or their service providers) involved in processing your transactions.

*   We may also disclose Personal Information to Partners and Merchants to enable their use of our Services to facilitate your transactions. For example, when you visit a participating Partners and Merchants site or app, the Partners and Merchants can check whether you are a user of PayPal services and present a recommended payment method to you to simplify your checkout process.

For our PayPal customers, we may also disclose your Personal Information to Partners and Merchants that you and we interact with to help ourselves and Partners and Merchants personalize services and offers so you can have a better and more relevant experience.

This further applies to parties we cooperate with for marketing purposes, in particular to show you ads and offers tailored to your interests. **Please be aware that these parties’ privacy notice applies to the Personal Information that you share directly with them**. For example, we use Google’s reCAPTCHA to prevent misuse of our Services, when you access our mobile application. We may also use Google Address Autofill to ensure accuracy of your address. Google’s [Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) and [Terms of Use](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/) apply to the Personal Information you share with them.

For example, if we are involved in a merger, a purchase, or a sale of all or part of our business or assets, including receivables and debts, we may disclose, under appropriate data protection terms, your Personal Information to an interested or actual buyer of those business or assets. If PayPal or a significant portion of PayPal’s assets are acquired by a third party, Personal Information may also be disclosed to that third party.

How Long We Store Your Personal Information
-------------------------------------------

We retain Personal Information for as long as needed or is permitted in context of the purpose for which it was collected and consistent with applicable law.

The criteria used to determine our retention period is as follows:

Personal Information used for the ongoing relationship between you and PayPal is stored for the duration of the relationship plus a period of 10 years or such period as mandated by any applicable local law once our relationship comes to an end, unless we need to keep it longer to the extent permitted by applicable law, such as:

*   When consistent with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or when permitted under applicable law, such as under applicable bankruptcy laws and AML obligations.
*   In connection with litigation, investigations, audit and compliance practices, or to protect against legal claims.
*   We retain Personal Information for the least amount of time necessary where retention is advisable in light of litigation, investigations, audit and compliance practices, or to protect against legal claims.

We retain biometric data for as long as needed or permitted given the purpose for which it was collected and no more than 3 years after your account closes, unless otherwise required by applicable law.

AI and Automated Decision Making
--------------------------------

We may process your Personal Information using AI and/or Automated Decision Making technology under the circumstances described below:

*   **Automated Decision Making**. PayPal uses Automated Decision Making technology to make assessments or decisions, including related to risk, fraud and creditworthiness, where permitted and in accordance with applicable law. Our Automated Decision Making technology may use profiling techniques to evaluate personal aspects about you, including to analyze or predict your economic situation, reliability and/or behavior. This enables us to assess, for example, whether you display traits indicating possible credit or financial risk, money laundering or fraudulent activity, that are inconsistent with any submissions you have made to us, or that suggest you have hidden your real identity. In making an Automated Decision, PayPal may process Users’ Personal Information. If we determine that you pose a credit, fraud, money laundering or other risk, we may refuse to provide new services to you, stop providing services you currently use, or place limits or restrictions on the services you use. Users may exercise rights related to Automated Decision Making, as described in [Your Data Protection Rights](#data-protection).
*   **Agentic AI**. PayPal is committed to offering innovative and personalized experiences, and we may, directly or through our trusted partners, provide you with access to Agentic AI tools (“Agentic AI Tools”). These AI tools are designed to operate with a degree of autonomy, enabling them to perform tasks, make recommendations, and even initiate actions on your behalf, all while learning from your interactions. Agentic AI Tools leverage generative AI technology to enhance your experience on the PayPal platform.

We encourage you to carefully consider the recommendations and actions of Agentic AI Tools. Our Agentic AI Tools are not designed to make decisions that have legal or similarly significant effects, such as decisions with legal, medical, financial, or employment implications, and you must not use (or attempt to use) them for any such purpose. These tools are intended only to provide general assistance and insights, and you should not rely on them to replace your own judgement and expertise.

Agentic AI Tools require access to certain information to function effectively. When you use these tools, they will have access to your Personal Information, including queries, preferences, interests, purchase history, and payment information.

Our Use of Cookies and Tracking Technologies
--------------------------------------------

When you interact with our Services, open email we send you, or visit a third-party website for which we provide Services, we and our partners use Cookies to grant you access to our Sites, Services, applications and tools, recognize you as a user, customize your online experiences and online content, including to serve you interest-based advertising, perform analytics, mitigate risk and prevent potential fraud, and promote trust and safety across our Services. We use Cookies to collect your device information, internet activity information, and generate inferences as described above.

Where appropriate, security measures are set in place to prevent unauthorized access to our Cookies and similar technologies. A unique identifier ensures that only we and/or our authorized service providers have access to Cookie data.

Service providers are companies that help us with various aspects of our business, such as Sites operations, Services, applications, advertisements and tools. We may use some authorized service providers to help us to serve you relevant ads on our Services and other places on the internet. These service providers may also place Cookies on your device via our Services (third-party Cookies). They may also collect information that helps them identify your device, such as IP-address or other unique device identifiers.

Certain aspects and features of our Services and Sites are only available through the use of Cookies, so if you choose to disable or decline Cookies through your device or browser settings, your use of the Sites and Services may be limited or not possible.

### Do Not Track

Some web browsers have an optional setting called “Do Not Track” (“**DNT**”) that lets you opt-out of being tracked by advertisers and some third parties. Because many of our services won’t function without tracking data, we do not respond to DNT settings.

If you want to know more about how we use cookies, please review our [Statement on Cookies and Tracking Technologies](https://www.paypal.com/legalhub/cookie-full). To learn how to opt-out of this kind of tracking technology, visit [About Ads](https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN).

*   If you reside in the United States, [Call or contact us](#contact) and request that we provide you with the data we’ve disclosed. For other countries, you may also submit a request through the [Help Center](https://www.paypal.com/smarthelp/contact-us/privacy).

**Your right to correct your Personal Information**. If you want to correct certain of your Personal Information, you can:

*   Log in to your PayPal account(s) or profile management portal, and submit a request.
*   If you reside in the United States, [Call or contact us](#contact) and request that we provide you with the data we’ve collected. For other countries, please refer to [Our Contact Information](#contact).

**Your right to delete your Personal Information**. If you want to delete certain of your Personal Information, you can:

*   Log in to your PayPal account(s) or profile management portal, and delete any information that you've previously added. For example, you may delete your non-primary addresses in your settings.
*   If you reside in the United States, [Call or contact us](#contact) and request that we provide you with the data we’ve collected. For other countries, please refer to [Our Contact Information](#contact).
*   Close your PayPal account(s) or profile.

If you close your PayPal account(s) or profile, delete, or request that we delete Personal Information, we still need to keep some Personal Information as explained in [How Long Do We Store Your Personal Information](#how-long) so we can, where permitted by applicable law:

*   Complete a transaction, provide goods or services you requested, or comply with our promises to you in the user agreement or other contract you have with us;
*   Detect and prevent malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity;
*   Protect your (or another person’s) legal rights, including the right to free speech;
*   Manage our internal business processes that are reasonably related to your expectations when using our Services;
*   Comply with laws and other legal or governmental processes; and
*   Other exempt purposes under applicable law.

**Your right to object to legitimate interest processing**. Where applicable by law, if you want to object to our use of your Personal Information to pursue our legitimate interests or those of a third party, you can refer to [Our Contact Information](#contact) of this Privacy Statement to contact us. See [Our Lawful Basis for Processing Personal Information](#lawful-basis) for more information.

**Your right to withdraw your consent**. If you want to withdraw consent to our use of your Personal Information in circumstances where we processed it with your consent, you can refer to [Our Contact Information](#contact) of this Privacy Statement to contact us. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your Personal Information conducted in reliance on a lawful processing ground other than consent.

**Your right to object to or opt out of Profiling in furtherance of Automated Decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects on you and related rights.**

*   As explained in [AI and Automated Decision Making](#ai) we may use Automated Decision Making technology and Agentic AI Tools.
*   In the United States, these are either exempt practices or do not trigger an opt-out right under applicable United States privacy laws. However, in other jurisdictions, individuals may exercise the right to seek a review of, or to object to and/or revoke consent for, an Automated Decision that has legal or similarly significant effects on them (together with the relevant Profiling), where this right exists, by [contacting us](#contact). We will then review the decision, taking into account relevant additional circumstances.
*   If you are not approved under the Automated Decisions, you may not have access to our services. PayPal has several safety mechanisms to ensure the decisions are appropriate. These mechanisms include ongoing overviews of our decision models and random sampling in individual cases. If you have any concern about the outcome, you can [contact us](#contact), and we will determine whether the procedure was performed appropriately.

**Your rights related to Sensitive Personal Information**. Where required by law, we will obtain your consent before collecting and processing your Sensitive Personal Information. You can withdraw your consent by contacting us and refer to [Our Contact Information](#contact) of this Privacy Statement.

*   We will also only use your Sensitive Personal Information in accordance with the consent you have given or for certain permitted purposes to the extent permitted or exempt under applicable law, which is why it is not necessary to exercise a right to limit use and disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information under the United States privacy laws. Under the United States privacy laws, these permitted purposes include providing the goods or services you requested; preventing, detecting, and investigating security incidents; resisting malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal actions and prosecuting those responsible; verifying or maintaining the quality or safety of a product, service, or device; and ensuring physical safety of natural persons. The exemption we rely on for precise geolocation is based on the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.

**Your rights related to disclosure of Personal Information to third-parties for direct marketing purposes**: You may request certain details about how your Personal Information is disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes. In the United States, [Call or contact us](#contact).

### Understanding your choices

You can control how Personal Information is collected or disclosed, as well as how we communicate with you. Here are some of the ways you can customize your choices.

### Choose how we collect Personal Information

You may choose to limit the Personal Information you provide when our apps or Services request it. To help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that Personal Information helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you.

Also, some Personal Information is required for our Services to function. For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to. If you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if you shared your contacts. Another example is creating an account or Fastlane profile with us. If you choose not to provide information that is required for an account or Fastlane profile to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account or Fastlane profile for you.

### Choose how linked accounts collect and use Personal Information

If you link your account(s) to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your Personal Information is collected, used, and shared by them. Read the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.  
You can control which third-party services you link to your account and what Personal Information they can collect about you. For example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your account(s).

### Choose what we disclose with other Users

Some Personal Information may be seen by other Users. You may be able to adjust or turn off this setting in the Data and Privacy section in your account settings.

### Choose what we share with Partners and Merchants for Personalized Shopping

Unless we are required to obtain your consent, we share Personal Information collected after November 27, 2024 (or from earlier if you consent) for personalized shopping experiences in the United States. Personal Information we disclose includes, for example, products, preferences, sizes, and styles we think you’ll like. To opt-out of Personal Information sharing with Partners and Merchants for personalized shopping experiences, log into your PayPal account and edit your preferences in the Data and Privacy setting. If you opt-out, we will continue to disclose your Personal Information as necessary to complete transactions you initiate but will not disclose Personal Information to Partners and Merchants for personalized shopping experiences.

### Choose how we communicate with you

Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message, how it is delivered and other requirements under applicable law. Some messages are considered optional, and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts or Fastlane profile with us. We use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even phone calls or paper mail depending on the situation, your preferences and applicable law.

You can click the unsubscribe link in a PayPal, Hyperwallet, or Fastlane marketing email, opt-out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device. You can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.

You won’t be able to opt-out of messages that are considered necessary for the Services, such as digital receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account(s) or Fastlane profile's status. You may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, phone, text message, or a notification on your mobile device.

International Transfers of Personal Information
-----------------------------------------------

We operate in many countries, and we (or our service providers) may transfer your Personal Information and process it outside the country where you live. For example, we use third-party service providers to process and store your Personal Information in the United States and other countries. These countries do not always afford a level of privacy protection that is equivalent to the protection offered to Personal Information in your country. We have taken and will continue to take specific steps, in accordance with the applicable data protection and privacy laws, to protect your Personal Information (e.g., intra-company agreements, model contractual clauses, and/or derogations). By using our Sites and Services, where permitted under applicable privacy laws, you agree to your Personal Information being transferred to other countries, including countries that have different data protection rules than your country.

For buyers using our PayPal Point of Sale services (including Venmo Tap to Pay), you may choose to provide us your contact details so that we can send you digital receipts. If you provide your e-mail address or mobile number to a Partner or Merchant who uses PayPal Point of Sale, we may remember your details for the next time you buy something from a Merchant who uses PayPal Point of Sale in its physical store, if you use the same payment card. This is regardless of whether you have previously bought something from this Merchant or not.

International Transfers of Personal Information
-----------------------------------------------

When we transfer Personal Information of EU residents within PayPal subsidiaries and affiliated companies, we rely on our [Binding Corporate Rules](https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/ua/bcr?locale.x=en_GB), which have been approved by competent Supervisory Authorities.

For any other transfer of Personal Information to a country outside of the UK (for UK residents) or the EEA (for EEA residents) we will ensure that any such transfers are compliant with EU and UK data protection law, as applicable.

In practice, this means that we will only transfer your Personal Information to a non-EEA or non-UK recipient where: (i) the recipient is located in a country that the European Commission has decided is adequate to receive Personal Information from the EEA or the UK Secretary of State has decided is adequate to receive Personal Information from the UK (as applicable); (ii) the recipient has signed appropriate contractual terms with us that incorporate the European Commission’s [Standard Contractual Clauses](https://commission.europa.eu/publications/standard-contractual-clauses-international-transfers_en) or the UK Information Commissioner’s [International Data Transfer Agreement or International Data Transfer Addendum](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/international-transfers/international-data-transfer-agreement-and-guidance/) (as applicable); or (iii) a data transfer derogation applies (for example, where you have consented to the transfer of your personal information).

Individuals located in the UK and EEA benefit from the following rights, which are further illustrated in [Your Data Protection Rights](#data-protection):

*   The right to be informed about the collection and use of your Personal Information;
*   The right to access and request copies of your Personal Information;

*   The right to object to processing of your Personal Information in certain circumstances where we process your Personal Information for tasks carried out in the public interest, in the exercise of an official authority, for our legitimate interests, for scientific or historical research, or statistical purposes, or for direct marketing purposes;
*   The right to withdraw your consent to the Processing of your Personal Information, including through opting-out of marketing communications, though without affecting the lawfulness of processing of your Personal Information based on consent before its withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your Personal Information conducted in reliance on a lawful processing ground other than consent. If we use your Personal Information for direct marketing, you can always modify your permissions, object and opt out of future direct marketing messages using the unsubscribe link in electronic communications or through your account settings;
*   The right to have automated decisions reviewed and to be informed of the existence of any Automated Decision Making, including any Profiling, and the logic involved, significance of and the envisaged consequences of any such processing;
*   The right to restrict our processing of your Personal Information in certain circumstances;
*   The right to data portability of your Personal Information by automated means in certain circumstances where we process your Personal Information based on consent, for performance of a contract or where the processing is required to assist you into entering into a contract.

In addition, you have the right to complain to your local Supervisory Authority about our use of your Personal Information.

In EEA, you may lodge a complaint with our lead supervisory authority for data protection, Luxemburg National Commission for Data Protection (CNPD) by post at Commission Nationale pour la Protection des Donnees, Service des plaints, 15, Boulevard du Jazz, L-4370 Belvaux, Luxembourg.

List of CRAs Used in the UK and EEA
-----------------------------------

The [list of CRAs](https://www.paypal.com/de/webapps/mpp/ua/cra-list-full?locale.x=en_DE) used in the UK and EEA, including identities of the CRAs used in each relevant country, and a link to their privacy notice from which you can determine the ways in which they use and share Personal Information, including how long they will retain such Personal Information. You can contact the CRAs operating in the country in which you live directly if you have any questions regarding their services, your credit score or the information they have stored about you, or if you wish to exercise your data subject rights towards them.

Banking Regulations Notice for Users in the EEA
-----------------------------------------------

In general, the Luxembourg laws to which PayPal’s handling of user Personal Information is subject (data protection and bank secrecy) require a higher degree of transparency than most other EU laws. This is why, unlike the vast majority of providers of internet-based services or financial services in the EU, PayPal has listed in this Privacy Statement the third party service providers and business partners to whom we may disclose your Personal Information, together with the purpose of disclosure and type of information disclosed. You can review those [third parties](https://www.paypal.com/ie/legalhub/paypal/third-parties-list). By accepting this Privacy Statement and maintaining an account with PayPal, you expressly agree to the transfer of your Personal Information to those third parties for the purposes listed.

PayPal may update the list of third parties referred to above on the first business day of every quarter (January, April, July and October). PayPal will only start transferring any Personal Information to any of the new entities or for the new purposes or Personal Information types indicated in each update after 30 days from the date when that list is made public through this Privacy Statement. You should review the list each quarter on the PayPal website on the dates stated above. If you do not object to the new Personal Information disclosure, within 30 days after the publication of the updated list of third parties, you are deemed to have accepted the changes to the list and to this Privacy Statement. If you do not agree with the changes, you may close your account and stop using our services.  
In order to provide the PayPal Services, certain of the information we collect (as set out in this Privacy Statement) may be required to be transferred to other PayPal related companies or other entities, including those referred to in this section in their capacity as payment providers, payment processors or account holders (or similar capacities). You acknowledge that according to their local legislation, such entities may be subject to laws, regulations, inquiries, investigations, or orders which may require the disclosure of information to the relevant authorities of the relevant country. Your use of the PayPal Services constitutes your consent to our transfer of such information to provide you the PayPal Services.

Specifically, you agree to and direct PayPal to do any and all of the following with your information:

1.  Disclose necessary information to: the police and other law enforcement agencies; security forces; competent governmental, intergovernmental or supranational bodies; competent agencies, departments, regulatory authorities, self-regulatory authorities or organisations (including, without limitation, the Agencies referenced in the “Agencies” section of the [Third Party Provider List](https://www.paypal.com/ie/legalhub/paypal/third-parties-list) and other third parties, including PayPal Group companies, that (i) we are legally compelled and permitted to comply with, including but without limitation the Luxembourg laws of 24 July 2015 on the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA Law”) and 18 December 2015 on the OECD common reporting standard (“CRS Law”); (ii) we have reason to believe it is appropriate for us to cooperate with in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity or potential illegal activity, or (iii) to conduct investigations of violations of our User Agreement (including without limitation, your funding source or credit or debit card provider).

If you are covered by the FATCA or CRS Law, we are required to give you notice of the information about you that we may transfer to various authorities. Please read more about PayPal's obligations under the FATCA and CRS Law and how they could affect you as well as take note of the information we may disclose as result.  
We and other organisations, including parties that accept PayPal, may also share, access and use (including from other countries) necessary information (including, without limitation the information recorded by fraud prevention agencies) to help us and them assess and to manage risk (including, without limitation, to prevent fraud, money laundering and terrorist financing). Please contact us if you want to receive further details of the relevant fraud prevention agencies. Review more information on these Agencies, fraud prevention agencies and other [third parties](https://www.paypal.com/ie/legalhub/paypal/third-parties-list).

3.  Disclose Account Information to intellectual property right owners if under the applicable national law of an EU member state they have a claim against PayPal for an out-of-court information disclosure due to an infringement of their intellectual property rights for which PayPal Services have been used (for example, but without limitation, Sec. 19, para 2, sub-section 3 of the German Trademark Act or Sec. 101, para 2, sub-section 3 of the German Copyright Act).
4.  Disclose necessary information in response to the requirements of the credit card associations or a civil or criminal legal process.
5.  Disclose your name and PayPal link in the PayPal user directory. Your details will be confirmed to other PayPal users in response to a user searching using your name, email address or telephone number, or part of these details. This is to ensure people make payments to the correct user. This feature can be turned off in the PayPal profile settings.
6.  If you as a merchant use a third party to access or integrate PayPal, we may disclose to any such partner necessary information for the purpose of facilitating and maintaining such an arrangement (including, without limitation, the status of your PayPal integration, whether you have an active PayPal account and whether you may already be working with a different PayPal integration partner).
7.  Disclose necessary information to the payment processors, auditors, customer services providers, credit reference and fraud agencies, financial products providers, commercial partners, marketing and public relations companies, operational services providers, group companies, agencies, marketplaces and other [third parties](https://www.paypal.com/ie/legalhub/paypal/third-parties-list). The purpose of this disclosure is to allow us to provide PayPal Services to you. We also set out in the list of third parties, under each " Category", non-exclusive examples of the actual third parties (which may include their assigns and successors) to whom we currently disclose your Account Information or to whom we may consider disclosing your Account Information, together with the purpose of doing so, and the actual information we disclose (except as explicitly stated, these third parties are limited by law or by contract from using the information for secondary purposes beyond the purposes for which the information was shared).
8.  Disclose necessary information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).
9.  Disclose aggregated statistical data with our business partners or for public relations. For example, we may disclose that a specific percentage of our users live in Manchester. However, this aggregated information is not tied to Personal Information.
10.  Share necessary Account Information with unaffiliated [third parties](https://www.paypal.com/ie/legalhub/paypal/third-parties-list) for their use for the following purposes:

1.  Fraud Prevention and Risk Management: to help prevent fraud or assess and manage risk.
2.  Customer Service: for customer service purposes, including to help service your accounts or resolve disputes (e.g., billing or transactional).
3.  Shipping: in connection with shipping and related services for purchases made using PayPal.
4.  Legal Compliance: to help them comply with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing verification requirements.
5.  Service Providers: to enable service providers under contract with us to support our business operations, such as fraud prevention, bill collection, marketing, customer service and technology services. Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit.
