### 1\. Overview

[PayPal](#PayPal) has developed this Privacy Statement to explain how [**PayPal**](#PayPal), as a [**Data Controller**](#Data Controller), may collect, retain, process, share and transfer your [Personal Data](#Personal Data) when you visit our [Sites](#Sites) or use our [Services](#Services). This Privacy Statement applies to your Personal Data when you visit Sites or use Services, and does not apply to online websites or services that we do not own or control, including websites or services of other PayPal [Users](#User).

As a European bank registered in Luxembourg, we comply with data protection and financial regulatory requirements. For the avoidance of doubt, this Privacy Statement does not constitute a “framework contract” for the purpose of the EU Payment Services Directive (2007/64/EC) or any implementation of that Directive in the European Economic Area.

This Privacy Statement is designed to help you obtain information about our privacy practices and to help you understand your privacy choices when you use our Sites and Services. Please note that our Service offerings may vary by region. This Privacy Statement may be supplemented with additional notices depending on the Sites and Services concerned. Supplementary information can be found in the [Statement on Cookies and Tracking Technologies](https://www.paypal.com/cz/webapps/mpp/ua/cookie-full?locale.x=en_CZ) and the [Banking Regulations Notice](#16).

We have defined some terms that we use throughout the Privacy Statement. You can find the meaning of a capitalised term in the [Definitions](#15) section.

Please [contact us](#2) if you have questions about our privacy practices that are not addressed in this Privacy Statement.

### 3\. What Personal Data Do We Collect?

We collect Personal Data about you when you visit our Sites or use our Services, including the following:

* **Registration and use information –** When you register to use our Services by establishing an [Account](#Account), we will collect Personal Data as necessary to offer and fulfil the Services you request. Depending on the Services you choose, we may require you to provide us with your name, postal address, telephone number, email address and identification information to establish an Account. We may require you to provide us with additional Personal Data as you use our Services.
    
* **Transaction and experience information –** When you use our Services or access our Sites, for example, to make purchases from merchants, to receive money, to process payments, or to send money to friends and family, we collect information about the transaction, as well as other information associated with the transaction such as amount sent or requested, amount paid for products or services, merchant information, including information about any funding instruments used to complete the transaction, [Device Information](#Device Information), [Technical Usage Data](#Technical Usage Data), and [Geolocation Information](#Geolocation Information).
* **Participant Personal Data** **–** When you use our Services or access our Sites, we collect Personal Data you provide us about the other participants associated with the transaction.

* **Send or request money:** When you send or request money through the Services, we collect Personal Data such as name, postal address, telephone number, and financial account information about the participant who is receiving money from you or sending money to you. The extent of Personal Data required about a participant may vary depending on the Services you are using to send or request money.
* **Pay or request someone else to pay a bill:**  If you use our Services to pay a bill for the benefit of someone else, or if you request a User to pay a bill for you, we collect Personal Data from you about the account holder such as name, postal address, telephone number, email address, and account number of the bill that you intend to pay or request to be paid.
* **Add value to your accounts**: If you use our Services to add value to your Account or any other account you may have, or if you ask a User to add value to any of these accounts, we may collect Personal Data from you about the other party, or from the other party about you to facilitate the request. For example, if you use our Services to reload a mobile phone, or to request value be added to your mobile account, we may collect Personal Data and other information including mobile account number from the other participant.

* **Information about your public profile and your friends and contacts –** It may be easier for us to help you transact with your friends and contacts if you choose to connect your contact list information with your Account or if your Account profile is publicly available. If you establish an account connection between your device or a social media platform and your Account, we will use your contact list information (such as name, address, email address) to improve your experience when you use the Services. When your Account profile is public, other users can find your profile to send you money by searching for you by name, username, email, or mobile number on PayPal and confirm it’s you by viewing your photo. You can make your Account profile private anytime in your PayPal.me settings.
* **Personal data that you choose to provide us to obtain additional Services** **or specific online Services –** If you request or participate in an optional Site feature, or request enhanced Services or other elective functionality, we may collect additional information from you. We will provide you with a separate notice at the time of collection, if the use of that Personal Data differs from the uses disclosed in this Privacy Statement.
* **Personal Data about you if you use unbranded Services –** certain Services are available without being required to log in to or establish an Account. We will collect Personal Data when you are interacting with and making payments to merchants using our card payment services that do not carry the PayPal brand and when you checkout with PayPal without logging into an account. For our unbranded payment services, your interaction is with the merchant, on their platform. If you are an Account holder, or create an Account at a later date, we may collect information about unbranded transactions and associate them with your Account to improve your customer experience as an Account holder and for compliance and analytics purposes. If you are not an Account holder, we will collect and store all information you provide and use such information in accordance with this Privacy Statement.
* **Personal Data about you from third-party sources –** We obtain information from third-party sources such as merchants, data providers, and credit bureaus, where permitted by law.
* **Other information we collect related to your use of our Sites or Services –** We may collect additional information from or about you when you communicate with us, contact our customer support teams or respond to a survey.
* Non-Account holders
* If you use our Services without creating or logging into an account, we’ll still collect personal data, which may include your payment information, device information, and location. When you use our Services without creating or logging into an account, we will use this information to process transactions, prevent fraud and comply with the law. We may connect this information with your account, if you have one or if you create an account at a later date.

### 4. Why Do We Retain Personal Data?

We retain Personal Data in an identifiable format for the least amount of time necessary to fulfill our legal or regulatory obligations and for our business purposes. We may retain Personal Data for longer periods than required by law if it is in our legitimate business interests and not prohibited by law. If your Account is closed, we may take steps to mask Personal Data and other information, but we reserve our ability to retain and access the data for so long as required to comply with applicable laws. We will continue to use and disclose such Personal data in accordance with this Privacy Statement.

The cookies we use have defined expiration times; unless you visit our Sites or use our Services within that time, the cookies are automatically disabled and retained data is deleted. Please consult our [Statement on Cookies and Tracking Technologies](https://www.paypal.com/cz/webapps/mpp/ua/cookie-full?locale.x=en_CZ) for more information.

### 5. How Will We Use Your Personal Data?

We may [Process](#Process) your Personal Data when we have a valid legal basis to do so. Depending on the circumstances, we may rely on your consent or the fact that processing is necessary to fulfill a contract with you, or to comply with law. We may also process your personal data where we believe it is in our or others’ legitimate interests, taking into consideration your interests, rights, and expectations.

We may also associate information that we learn about you through your and your contacts’ use of the Services, and information you and others provide, to suggest people you may know or may want to transact with through our Services. Social functionality and features designed to simplify your use of the Services with others vary by Service.

### 6. Do We Share Personal Data?

We may share your Personal Data or other information about you with others in a variety of ways as described in this section of the Privacy Statement. We may share your Personal Data or other information for the following reasons:

**With other members of the PayPal corporate family:** We may share your Personal Data with members of the PayPal family of entities to, among other things, provide the Services you have requested or authorised; to manage risk; to help detect and prevent potentially illegal and fraudulent acts and other violations of our policies and agreements and to help us manage the availability and connectivity of PayPal products, Services, and communications.

**With other companies that provide services to us:** We share Personal Data with third-party service providers that perform services and functions at our direction and on our behalf. These third-party service providers may, for example, provide you with Services, verify your identity, assist in processing transactions, send you advertisements for our products and services, or provide customer support. 

**With other financial institutions:** We share Personal Data with other financial institutions that we have partnered with to jointly create and offer a product. These financial institutions may only use this information to market and offer PayPal-related products, unless you have given consent for other uses. We may also share Personal Data to process transactions, provide you with benefits associated with your eligible cards, and keep your financial information up to date.

**With the other parties to transactions when you use the Services, such as other Users, merchants, and their service providers:** We may share information about you and your Account with the other parties involved in processing your transactions. This includes other Users you are sending or receiving funds from and merchants, and their service providers. The information might include:

* Personal Data and Account information necessary to facilitate the transaction;
* Personal Data to help other participant(s) resolve disputes and detect and prevent fraud; and
* Anonymous data and performance analytics to help merchants better understand the uses of our Services and to help merchants enhance Users’ experiences. 

**With other third parties for our business purposes or as** **permitted or** **required by law:** We may share information about you with other parties for PayPal’s business purposes or as permitted or required by law, including:

* if we need to do so to comply with a law, legal process or regulations;
* to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, or other third parties pursuant to a subpoena, a court order or other legal process or requirement applicable to PayPal or PayPal’s corporate family;
* if we believe, in our sole discretion, that the disclosure of Personal Data is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity;

This data will not personally identify you or provide information about your use of the Sites or Services.** **We do not share your Personal Data with third parties for their marketing purposes without your consent.**

### 7. How Do We Work with Other Services and Platforms?

A significant benefit and innovation of PayPal’s Services is that you can connect your Account with a third-party account or platform. For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, an “account connection” with such a third-party is a connection you authorise or enable between your Account and a non-PayPal account, payment instrument, or platform that you lawfully control or own. When you authorise such a connection, PayPal and the third-party will exchange your Personal Data and other information directly. Examples of account connections include:

* linking your Account to a social media account or social messaging service;
* connecting your Account to a third-party data aggregation or financial services company, if you provide such company with your Account log-in credentials; or
* using your Account to make payments to a merchant or allowing a merchant to charge your Account.

If you choose to create an account connection, we may receive information from the third-party about you and your use of the third-party’s service. For example, if you connect your Account to a social media account, we will receive Personal Data from the social media provider via the account connection. If you connect your Account to other financial accounts, directly or through a third-party service provider, we may have access to your account balance and transactional information, such as purchases and funds transfers. We will use all such information that we receive from a third-party via an account connection in a manner consistent with this Privacy Statement. 

Information that we share with a third-party based on an account connection will be used and disclosed in accordance with the third-party’s privacy practices. Before authorising an account connection, you should review the privacy notice of any third-party that you authorised to have an account connection that will gain access to your Personal Data as part of the account connection. For example, Personal Data that PayPal shares with a third-party account or platform such as a social media account may in turn be shared with certain other parties, including the general public, depending on the account’s or platform’s privacy practices. 

### 8. International transfers

Our operations are supported by a network of computers, cloud-based servers, and other infrastructure and information technology, including, but not limited to, third-party service providers. 

The parties mentioned above may be established in jurisdictions other than your own and outside the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom (the “UK”). These countries do not always afford an equivalent level of privacy protection. We have taken specific steps, in accordance with EEA data protection law, to protect your Personal Data. In particular, for transfers of your Personal Data within PayPal related companies, we rely on Binding Corporate Rules approved by competent Supervisory Authorities (available [here](https://www.paypal.com/cz/webapps/mpp/ua/bcr?locale.x=en_CZ)). Other transfers may be based on contractual protections. Please contact us for more information about this.

If you make transactions with parties outside the EEA, Switzerland, the UK or connect our Service with platforms, such as social media, outside the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, we are required to transfer your Personal Data with those parties in order to provide the requested Service to you.

### 9. How Do We Use Cookies and Tracking Technologies? 

When you visit our Sites, use our Services, or visit a third-party website for which we provide online services, we and our business partners and vendors may use cookies and other tracking technologies (collectively, “Cookies”) to recognise you as a User and to customise your online experiences, the Services you use, and other online content and advertising; measure the effectiveness of promotions and perform analytics; and to mitigate risk, prevent potential fraud, and promote trust and safety across our Sites and Services. Certain aspects and features of our Services and Sites are only available through the use of Cookies, so if you choose to disable or decline Cookies, your use of the Sites and Services may be limited or not possible.

Do Not Track (DNT) is an optional browser setting that allows you to express your preferences regarding tracking by advertisers and other third-parties. We do not respond to DNT signals.

Please review our [Statement on Cookies and Tracking Technologies](https://www.paypal.com/cz/webapps/mpp/ua/cookie-full?locale.x=en_CZ) to learn more about how we use Cookies.

### 10. What Privacy Choices Are Available To You?

* **Choices Relating to Cookies**
    * Online Tracking and Interest-Based Marketing. We work with partners and third-party service providers to serve you advertising using ad-related cookies and web beacons.

You will continue to see our advertising on third party websites.
    
    * For more information on third-party advertising-related cookies and interest-based marketing, and to learn how to opt-out of these practices with companies participating in industry self-regulation, please visit **Your Online Choices**.
    
    * You may have options available to manage your browser preferences. For example, your browser or internet device may allow you delete, disable, or block certain cookies and other tracking technologies. You can learn more by visiting AboutCookies.org. You may choose to enable these options, but doing so may prevent you from using many of the core features and functions available on a Service or Site.
    * You may have an option regarding the use of cookies and other tracking technologies when you use a Service or visit parts of a Site. For example, you may be asked if you want the Service or Site to “remember” certain things about you, and we will use cookies and other tracking technologies to the extent that you permit them.
    * You can learn more about our cookies and tracking technologies by visiting the Statement on Cookies and Tracking Technologies page.
* **Choices Relating to Your Registration and Account Information**
    * If you have an Account, you may review and edit Personal Data by logging in and updating the information directly or by contacting us. [contact us](#2) if you do not have an Account or if you have questions about your Account information or other Personal Data.

* **Promotional Marketing:** We may send you marketing content about our Sites, Services, products, products we jointly offer with financial institutions, as well as the products and services of unaffiliated third parties and members of the PayPal corporate family through various communication channels, for example, email, text, pop-ups, push notifications, and messaging applications. You may opt out of these marketing communications we send by following the instructions in the communications you receive. If you have an Account with us, you may also adjust your communication preferences in your Account settings. For messages sent via push notifications, you may manage your preferences in your device.
* **Informational and Other:** We will send communications to you that are required or necessary to send to Users of our Services, notifications that contain important information and other communications that you request from us. You may not opt out of receiving these communications. However, you may be able to adjust the media and format through which you receive these notices.

### 11. What Are Your Rights?

Subject to limitations set out in EEA data protection laws, you have certain rights in respect of your Personal Data. In particular, you have a right of access, rectification, restriction, erasure and data portability. Please contact us if you wish to exercise these rights.

Further, subject to specific requirements, you have the right to object to processing of your personal data based on legitimate interests or a public interest or an official authority vested in us.

If you have an Account with any of our Services, you generally can review and edit Personal Data in the Account by logging in and updating the information directly. We may use automated decision-making for decisions concerning credit with your consent or where necessary for the entry into or performance of a contract or authorised by Union or Member state law.

The security measures include firewalls, data encryption, physical access controls to our data centres, and information access authorisation controls. While we are dedicated to securing our systems and Services, you are responsible for securing and maintaining the privacy of your password(s) and Account/profile registration information and verifying that the Personal Data we maintain about you is accurate and current.

### Banking Regulations Notice for Customers in the EEA

In general, the Luxembourg laws to which PayPal’s handling of user data is subject (data protection and bank secrecy) require a higher degree of transparency than most other EU laws. This is why, unlike the vast majority of providers of internet-based services or financial services in the EU, PayPal has listed in this Privacy Statement the third party service providers and business partners to whom we may disclose your data, together with the purpose of disclosure and type of information disclosed. You will find a link to those third parties [**here**](https://www.paypal.com/cz/webapps/mpp/ua/third-parties-list?locale.x=en_CZ). By accepting this Privacy Statement and maintaining an account with PayPal, you expressly consent to the transfer of your data to those third parties for the purposes listed.

PayPal may update the list of third parties referred to above on the first business day of every quarter (January, April, July and October). PayPal will only start transferring any data to any of the new entities or for the new purposes or data types indicated in each update after 30 days from the date when that list is made public through this Privacy Statement. You should review the list each quarter on the PayPal website on the dates stated above. If you do not object to the new data disclosure, within 30 days after the publication of the updated list of third parties, you are deemed to have accepted the changes to the list and to this Privacy Statement. If you do not agree with the changes, you may close your account and stop using our services.

In order to provide the PayPal Services, certain of the information we collect (as set out in this Privacy Statement) may be required to be transferred to other PayPal related companies or other entities, including those referred to in this section in their capacity as payment providers, payment processors or account holders (or similar capacities). You acknowledge that according to their local legislation, such entities may be subject to laws, regulations, inquiries, investigations, or orders which may require the disclosure of information to the relevant authorities of the relevant country. Your use of the PayPal Services constitutes your consent to our transfer of such information to provide you the PayPal Services.

Specifically, you agree to and direct PayPal to do any and all of the following with your information:

1.

2.

3. Disclose necessary information in response to the requirements of the credit card associations or a civil or criminal legal process.
    
4. Disclose your name and PayPal link in the PayPal user directory. Your details will be confirmed to other PayPal users in response to a user searching using your name, email address or telephone number, or part of these details. This is to ensure people make payments to the correct user. This feature can be turned off in the PayPal profile settings.
    
5. If you as a merchant use a third party to access or integrate PayPal, we may disclose to any such partner necessary information for the purpose of facilitating and maintaining such an arrangement (including, without limitation, the status of your PayPal integration, whether you have an active PayPal account and whether you may already be working with a different PayPal integration partner).

7. Disclose necessary information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).
