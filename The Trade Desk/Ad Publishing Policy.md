============================

Terms and Conditions

_Last updated: December 12, 2017_  

These Inventory Supplier Agreement Terms and Conditions (“**Terms and Conditions**”) govern Company’s supply of Inventory to TD and are incorporated into the Inventory Supplier Agreement (“**Agreement**”) entered into by the parties. By executing the Agreement, Company agrees to these Terms and Conditions. TD may modify these Terms and Conditions at any time, and such modifications shall become effective immediately upon posting. Any capitalized terms used herein but not defined shall have the means ascribed to them in the Agreement.

**1\. PARTIES**.

TD allows its customers (“**Ad Partners**”) to purchase digital inventory through the TD platform for the purpose of displaying such Ad Partners’ digital ads (the “**Ads**”). Company provides an impression auction service (“**Service”**) that enables buyers (e.g., TD’s Ad Partners) to purchase digital inventory (e.g., advertising space on third party websites, apps and other online properties) (the “**Inventory**”) of inventory suppliers (e.g., publishers and/or media companies) (collectively, “**Inventory Suppliers**”) for the purpose of displaying Ads via real time bidding (“**RTB**”) and/or private marketplace (“**PMP”**) formats, and may also include inventory packaged based upon data sets. For purposes of clarification, the Service shall include tracking technology utilized by Company to provide the Inventory and related data from Inventory Suppliers and visitors on Inventory Supplier’s websites, apps and other online properties.

**2\. LICENSES.**

2.1. Company. Company grants to TD a non-exclusive, non-transferable (except in connection with a permitted assignment of the Agreement), non-sublicensable right to use the Service as described in this Agreement. This Agreement applies to TD’s use of the Service for itself and on behalf of any TD Ad Partners.

2.2. TD. TD grants to Company a limited, revocable, sublicensable (solely to the extent necessary to the applicable Inventory Supplier), worldwide license: (i) for Non-Native Ads provided by TD and/or its Ad Partners, to copy, encode, publish and display in real time to the end user (i.e., not cached or locally stored to be displayed to the end user at a later time), and (ii) for Native Ads provided by TD and/or its Ad Partners, to copy, store, modify (solely as set forth in Section 2.3 of these Terms and Conditions) and display all elements of the Native Ad together. For each Ad, whether Non-Native or Native, the foregoing licenses are solely for Inventory purchased for such Ad by or on behalf of the Ad Partner. As used herein, “**Native Ad**” means an Ad that is harmonious with the surrounding content and “**Non-Native Ad**” means an Ad that is not a Native Ad.

2.3. Modifications to Ads. Company shall not modify any Ad and shall not publish or display less than the full Ad unless otherwise specified in this Section 2.3 of these Terms and Conditions. In the event Inventory Supplier requires the elements of any Native Ad to be sent in advance so that it may be customized for the “look and feel” of the surrounding content, upon TD’s request, prior to displaying any Native Ad, Company will provide, or will ensure that the Inventory Supplier provides, a mockup of each modified Native Ad to TD or, at TD’s direction, a third party (e.g., the advertiser or its agency) for final approval. With respect to Native Ads, Company represents and warrants that it will not and shall not permit the Inventory Supplier to (a) format or display such Ads in a manner that is potentially misleading (e.g., that a Native Ad is editorial or other non-advertising content), (b) run the Ad prior to securing final approval from TD or the applicable Ad Partner, as required, or (c) remove or diminish the prominence of any disclaimer or Ad Choices icon that is included in the Native Ad creative provided by TD or the Ad Partner.

2.4. Ownership. As between TD and Company, (a) Company owns all right, title and interest in the Service, including future developments and enhancements, and (b) TD owns all right, title and interest in its technologies, platform, Ads provided hereunder and all elements of such Ad. Aside from the licenses granted in Sections 2.1 and 2.3 and in Section 6 (with respect to data ownership) of these Terms and Conditions, neither party grants the other any other license, express or implied, and each party reserves all rights not expressly granted hereunder.

**3\. USER PRIVACY.**

Each party’s standard agreement with its partners (e.g., publishers and other supply partners of Company; advertisers and other demand partners of TD) will require such partners to publish and comply with a legally sufficient privacy policy, as well as providing (among other things) sufficient notice, enhanced notice, and opt-out, and otherwise comply with the requirements of the DAA Self-Governing Principles found at [aboutads.info](http://aboutads.info/), for any Inventory Suppliers located in (or with end users that are or may be located in) the European Union, the EDAA Self-Regulatory Framework found at [http://www.youronlinechoices.com/goodpractice](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/goodpractice), and for any Inventory Suppliers outside of the US or EU (or with end users that are or may be located outside of the US or EU), any other local law requirements and self-regulatory guidelines applicable to it or the use of the Inventory (together, the “**Self-Regulatory Requirements**”). Additionally, all collection, use, and disclosure of all user information provided by Company (including as provided by its Inventory Suppliers) shall be in compliance with all applicable laws and privacy policies, including but not limited to the Video Privacy Protection Act.

**4\. COMPLIANCE**.

4.1. Applicable Law. Each party will comply with all laws, rules and regulations and the Self-Regulatory Requirements, applicable to activities related to this Agreement (including but not limited to its own collection of data and tracking of web users), and the parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other to ensure compliance. Company shall include, and shall ensure its Inventory Suppliers include, any legally required disclosures applicable to any native advertising (e.g., FTC endorsement disclosures). In addition, to the extent that a Native Ad contains such a disclosure, Company shall not remove or obscure such disclosure.

4.2. Auction. In an effort to create a level playing field so as to enable evolution toward a more efficient marketplace, the parties agree that all Inventory provided to TD and/or TD’s Ad Partners hereunder, unless provided pursuant to a fixed price PMP deal with a DealID, shall be provided to TD and its Ad Partners pursuant to a Fair Auction. As used herein, a “**Fair Auction**” means an auction in which: (i) all participants, including Company’s affiliates and related parties, are treated equally and no participant is granted preferences in the auction, (ii) the rules of the auction are transparent and clearly, fully and accurately described, including without limitation, all fees charged to the buyer of the inventory, all fees to the Inventory Supplier, all fees to Company /or its affiliates and related parties and all fees to any other party, and (iii) price floors are not set based on the identity of TD or its Ad Partners or the prior bidding behavior of TD or its Ad Partners. All Company auctions shall be run as a single auction per format, per user and per impression (auctions will not be run as “multi-auctions”) and shall not utilize cached bids. Company shall certify (by any of the CEO, the CFO or the CLO) to all of the mechanics of the auction service within fifteen (15) days after TD’s written request (email to suffice).TD may not request such certification more than once per six (6) month period; provided that, if TD believes in good faith that Company may be in violation of this Section 4.2 of these Terms and Conditions, TD may request such certification as frequently as once per month). Each certification provided by Company shall include information regarding any fees charged to TD and /or its Ad Partners, Inventory Supplier fees or any other fees charged by Company to TD and/or its Ad Partners, Inventory Supplier IDs for each impression, floor price for each impression, first price in each auction, second price in each auction and modified second price in each auction if applicable, in each case with sufficient detail for TD to confirm compliance by Company of this Section.

4.3. Inventory Specs. Company’s web Inventory and related information and signals will meet the IAB's Ad Inventory Specifications (described at [http://www.iab.com/guidelines/?category=ad-unit-guideline](http://www.iab.com/guidelines/?category=ad-unit-guideline) as of the Effective Date); provided, that for Inventory for Native Ads, Company’s web Inventory will meet the TD-developed protocol based on the IAB's OpenRTB API Specification, or as otherwise updated from time to time. For any Inventory for which the IAB has not published specifications, either TD shall provide those specifications or the parties will work together in good faith.

4.4. Inventory Standards. Company will comply with the inventory standards set forth in Exhibit A, attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference, as well as any Ad Partner standards provided to Company in writing, as each may be amended from time to time upon prior written notice (collectively, “**Inventory Standards**”).

4.5. Steps to Reduce Invalid Inventory. Invalid Inventory (as defined herein) engenders mistrust and inefficiency in the marketplace. In order to help create a more trustworthy and efficient marketplace, Company agrees to take active steps to combat fraudulent Inventory from its Inventory Suppliers. As a step in that direction, Company consents to the use of reporting from Media Rating Council-accredited third party services utilized by TD and/or its Ad Partners to reduce inventory from sites or users with invalid inventory, including but not limited to zero viewability, Inventory or sites that are purposefully misrepresented or mislabeled (e.g., “referrer” Inventory), SIVT (as defined by the Media Rating Council), and fraudulent inventory (collectively, “**Invalid Inventory**”). The parties agree that such reports are deemed conclusive and will be used in calculating fees owed by TD hereunder. Company will also provide to TD quarterly reports with the percentage of its Inventory Suppliers that have adopted ads.txt (and shall provide such report additionally upon request by TD). TD shall have no obligation to pay for any fees associated with Invalid Inventory and, if already paid for, Company shall refund all such amounts within 30 days after TD notifies Company thereof. In the event TD notifies Company of Invalid Inventory from a particular Inventory Supplier ID and thereafter a bid request is sent to TD for Invalid Inventory from the same Inventory Supplier ID, in addition to the foregoing remedy, TD reserves the right to charge, and Company agrees to pay TD, 1% of the amount paid or otherwise payable to Company for the corresponding month.

4.6. Lawful OBT. Company will not make any Inventory available through the Service if the end users of such Inventory cannot lawfully be tracked using a persistent identifier for purposes of receiving advertising targeted on the basis of such end user’s online behavior.

4.7. COPPA. Company shall not provide any Inventory that is subject to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.

4.8. Changes to Inventory Supply. If Company intends to materially change the amount of Inventory made available in terms of daily impressions (e.g., a change of more than 20% in total impressions sent daily), it must provide at least 10 business days’ notice to TD. If there is a material change in the amount of Inventory made available in terms of daily impressions and Company does not provide TD with the foregoing notice, then TD may reject traffic in its sole discretion.

4.9. Accurate and More Succinct Bid Requests. In order to minimize confusion and repetition in bid requests, Company agrees that:

(i) Company auctions will always accurately pass in the bid request for each impression: (a) the applicable deal type (e.g., fixed price guarantee, variable, or others) in the auction type field, b) auction type (e.g., first price, second price, modified second price) in the Auction Type field, and (c) when made available, first price auctions, how/who closes the auction in the Final Decision field;

(ii) bid requests for each impression shall contain publisher ID, all video signals, placement and tag IDs, transparent floors, transparent domains that are not masked in any way, and impressions identified as “syndicated” when supplied from upstream aggregators;

(iii) Company will enable TD to turn off DFP clearing prediction by reading an “off” flag passed by TD to Company with its bids; and

(iv) Company will not make available to TD or TD’s Ad Partners any inventory that has been purchased or arbitraged from another exchange service or supply side platform.

4.10. No Misuse of Ads; No Change to Bids. Company shall not utilize any Ad in any manner not permitted under this Agreement. Company shall not modify (e.g., increase or decrease) TD’s or an Ad Partner’s bid amount as part of any impression auction. For example, if an Ad Partner bids $1.00 for an impression, then $1.00 is the bid amount that will be used in the impression auction.

4.11. Provisioning APIs. Commencing on the Effective Date, in order to improve efficiencies, Company agrees to work collaboratively and diligently with TD to develop provisioning APIs to exchange creative approvals and metadata to enable provision of creative approvals or disapprovals. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Company shall never block a bid from creative that has been approved by Company. Company shall publish its Inventory Supplier exclusion policies and unique Inventory Supplier Creative Acceptance Policies (CAPs).

4.12. Service and Platforms. Company will ensure that the Service, Company’s technology and services as well as the Inventory and associated websites, apps and other digital platforms do not and will not: (a) include, promote or depict obscene or pornographic material, illegal products or services, gambling, discrimination on the basis of race, sex, creed, national origin, religious affiliation, physical disability, sexual orientation or language, deceptive or libelous content. (b) violate any applicable law, rule, regulation, or governmental guidelines (including but not limited to the FTC guidelines on native advertising), (c) infringe any third party rights including but not limited to intellectual property rights, or (d) distribute or contain viruses or other malware.

4.13. Inventory Supplier Discussions. TD shall be permitted to discuss, and Company shall facilitate such discussions, with five (5) Inventory Suppliers, the CPMs for such Inventory Supplier’s Inventory through the Service to confirm compliance hereunder.

**5\. Reporting; Billing and Payments**.

5.1. Guaranteed Placements**.** TD may elect, upon written notice (email to suffice) and on an agency by agency basis, to be the server of record for Guaranteed Placements. In such event, (i) TD will submit reporting to Company within five (5) business days after the end of each month, and (ii) Company will invoice TD for the Guaranteed Placements purchased during such month within ten (10) business days after the end of such month. As used herein, “**Guaranteed Placements**” means those placements that are not subject to an open auction, such as fixed price PMP, that are purchased by or on behalf of TD and/or TD’s Ad Partners through the Service. The Parties may also mutually agree in writing that the records of a third party (e.g., agency, fraud vendor, viewability vendor) shall be the controlling measurement used for invoicing and payment.

5.2. Non-Guaranteed Placements. For all non-Guaranteed Placements, Company shall be the server of record except as otherwise provided herein. Company shall comply with the reporting requirements set forth on Exhibit B attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference. TD will have access to Company’s online reporting interface and, if Company does not have an online reporting interface, Company will send TD a daily email or otherwise make available a daily report. TD will pay Company all undisputed amounts within 90 days of receipt of each invoice. If there is a discrepancy of more than 5% between Company’s impression counts and TD’s impression counts for a given month, the parties will work together in good faith to resolve such discrepancy; provided, that in the event any discrepancy exceeds 10%, a senior executive (VP or more senior) from Company shall meet with a representative from TD within 24 hours. If Company fails to timely provide a daily report, or the discrepancy exceeds 10% in any given day, the parties agree that, at TD’s option, the invoicing shall be based on TD’s numbers until such time as Company commences to timely report again, or discrepancies remain below 10% to TD’s satisfaction, in each case in TD’s sole discretion.

5.3. Subject to the remainder of this Section, each month Company will invoice TD (x) within five (5) business days from the end of the applicable month for the non-Guaranteed Placements, and (y) ten (10) business days for the Guaranteed Placements, purchased by or on behalf of TD’s Ad Partners through the Service during that month. Company shall bill TD for Inventory purchased on an open auction (RTB) basis, as well as for Inventory purchased on a DealID basis that is not otherwise indicated to be a “direct bill” DealID. For each DealID that Company (or the Inventory Supplier) bills the Ad Partner or advertiser directly, Company shall notify TD in writing (email sufficing), each being deemed a “direct bill” DealID. For all “direct bill” DealIDs, Company shall not look to TD and TD shall have no liability for any amounts due relating to such Inventory. Company’s books and records shall be sufficiently detailed to ensure that all DealID Inventory clearly delineate “direct bill” DealIDs from all other DealIDs. Company shall ensure that for all DealIDs for which it invoices TD, neither it nor its Inventory Supplier shall also invoice an Ad Partner or advertiser (or a third party). If Company receives payment from both TD and from a third party for a particular DealID, Company shall immediately notify TD and shall refund such amounts to TD within 30 days from such notification. In the event TD is notified by its Ad Partner that it or its advertiser paid Company (or the Inventory Supplier) directly, then Company shall refund such amounts to TD within 30 days of such notification. Company shall respond to all inquiries relating to DealID payments promptly to ensure compliance with the foregoing.

5.4. Payments. TD will pay Company all undisputed amounts within 90 days of receipt of each invoice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Company will only hold TD liable for payments solely to the extent that TD has received the corresponding payments from its Ad Partners. TD shall not be responsible for payment of any amounts invoiced more than fifteen (15) days after the end of the month in which the Inventory was purchased. Invoicing and payment will be made in US dollars; provided, that, TD may request invoicing in a different currency, and Company shall accommodate such request to the extent reasonably practicable, in which case the invoicing must be in the same currency as the agreed upon transaction currency. If an Ad Partner requires a refund or imposes a deduction due to Company’s breach (determined in TD’s sole discretion) of Section 4 of these Terms and Conditions or the Inventory Standards after TD has already made payment or after the Term has ended, Company will promptly reimburse TD for any such refund or deduction.TD will not be obligated to pay for any Inventory that does not comply with the applicable Inventory Standards or this Agreement. In addition, if Company breaches Section 4 of these Terms and Conditions or TD’s Inventory Standards, TD reserves the right to charge Company 1% of the amount paid or otherwise payable to Company for the corresponding month to defray TD’s administration costs associated with Company’s breach. The foregoing is not TD’s sole remedy under any circumstances. Except for taxes on TD’s income, Company is responsible for paying all applicable sales, use or other taxes or duties, tariffs, etc. applicable to the Service.TD may hold any payment until the cumulative amount owed to Company totals at least $100.
