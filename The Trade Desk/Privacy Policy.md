**WHAT THIS POLICY COVERS**

This privacy policy covers data that the Trade Desk collects, uses and discloses from our websites, client-facing portals, Careers Page and by other means, including through your contact with us.

It describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and your rights.

This policy does not cover data that is collected, used or disclosed through the Trade Desk’s advertising technology platform and systems (the “Platform”). For more information on privacy as it relates to the Platform, please see [The Trade Desk Services Privacy Policy](https://www.thetradedesk.com/us/privacy).

This policy does not apply to the privacy practices of other websites that are linked from our websites. The Trade Desk is not responsible for the privacy practices of these other websites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of those websites to understand their data privacy practices.

****INFORMATION WE COLLECT **FROM OUR WEBSITES AND OTHER SOURCES******

We may collect personal information such as your name, email address and phone number directly from you. For example, when you provide information through a form on our websites or apply for a role through our career pages.

The personal information that you are asked to provide, and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, will be made clear to you at the point we ask you to provide your personal information.

We may collect personal information through third party services for the purpose of job recruitment, such as vendor platforms that provide candidate search and data engine for sourcing and recruiting efforts.

**Analytics Data**

We may automatically collect analytics data, such as browser type and language, access times, pages visited, and referring website addresses, and mobile data such as the mobile browser and type and model of your device. We use this data to understand how our websites are used and to improve them.

****HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT****

Any personal information you provide to us will only be used for the purposes for which you provided it, as disclosed at the time it was collected. For example:

* We respond to inquiries and provide requested information regarding our products and services
* We may send you marketing communications related to our products, such as our newsletter, if you are a client or have chosen to receive it

If you no longer wish to receive marketing email communications or wish to opt out, you can follow the unsubscribe instructions contained in the emails you receive or by contacting us via this [webform](https://privacyportal-eu.onetrust.com/webform/2abc1a63-35c5-4ef7-b11b-1c55714738b5/61b81601-fe65-4dfe-a922-e1c5a68fa8cb).

**HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION**

We will share your information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this policy. We do not sell information collected through our websites to any third party.

We may disclose your information to companies that provide data processing services to help us with our business activities, such as sending email communications on our behalf. These companies are authorized to use your information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

We will also disclose your information:

* As required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process,
* When we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request,
* If the Trade Desk is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, in such case you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our websites of any change in ownership or uses of your information, as well as any choices you have regarding your information, or
* With your permission, with another third party.

**UID2 and EUID**

We may use your email address to create a consistent unique identifier called a UID2 or, in Europe, a EUID. These allow us, and other participants in the UID2/EUID advertising framework, to ensure that the ads you see online are relevant and measure the effectiveness of our advertising.

You can read more about how UID2 works on [Transparentadvertising.org](https://transparentadvertising.org/).

You can read more about how EUID works, how to opt-out and your rights on the [EU Transparency website](https://www.transparentadvertising.eu/privacy).

**COOKIES ON OUR WEBSITES**

“Cookies” are data files that are stored on your browser or device and are used to remember user preferences and behaviors over time. Cookies allow us to recognize your device and remember information, such as your preferred language and other general settings.

Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, the Trade Desk) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Our websites use both first party and third-party cookies.

We may use third party cookies from social media platforms such as LinkedIn and Facebook. If you consent to these cookies being used, then we may share information with you on these social media platforms.

For more information about specific cookies on this site, please see our [Cookie Notice](https://www.thetradedesk.com/us/cookie-notice).

**CANDIDATE INFORMATION**

If you are a candidate for an employment opportunity at The Trade Desk, we will process the data necessary to manage your engagement for opportunities at The Trade Desk, for example the interview process and access to The Trade Desk offices.

We may keep your profile information when you log-in to the career site using LinkedIn, apply for jobs, subscribe to job alerts or join Talent communities. See the YOUR RIGHTS section below for information on how to request your data with us.  

**YOUR RIGHTS**

Depending upon where you live, you may have certain legal rights with respect to the personal information we collect and process about you.

These rights may include the right to request access, deletion, and correction of personal information. You may also have the right to opt out of activities that constitute “sales” or “sharing” as such terms are defined under certain state privacy laws in the United States. These rights may be limited, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal information about another person or infringe the rights of a third party (including our rights) or if you ask us to delete information that we are required by law to keep.

We will inform you of relevant exemptions we rely upon when responding to any request you make. We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your rights under applicable law.

**­**If you’d like to access, update, correct, or request deletion of your information that you have provided to us on our websites or elsewhere, please fill out this [webform](https://privacyportal-eu.onetrust.com/webform/2abc1a63-35c5-4ef7-b11b-1c55714738b5/61b81601-fe65-4dfe-a922-e1c5a68fa8cb) or send your request to us at [dsr@thetradedesk.com](mailto:dsr@thetradedesk.com).

Any requests will be reviewed and responded within 30 days.

**SECURITY AND RETENTION**

We retain the personal information you provide to us for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services or perform the purposes for which it was supplied.
