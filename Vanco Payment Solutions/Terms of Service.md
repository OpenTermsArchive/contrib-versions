Vanco Payment Solutions Terms of Service
----------------------------------------

These Terms of Service (the “**Terms**”) apply to the websites owned by Vanco Payment Solutions Inc. and Vanco Payment Solutions, LLC (collectively, “**Vanco**,” “**we**” or “**us**”) on which these Terms are posted, (collectively, the “**Sites**”); they also apply to our mobile applications (each an “**App**”), as well as the services available through the App and Site (subject to the terms applicable to Third-Party Sites, as described below). Unless otherwise stated, references herein to “**Site**” include the Apps and the Services.

**These Terms are a legal contract between you and Vanco, and govern your use of the Site. By using the Site, you are agreeing to all of the Terms; if you do not agree with any of the Terms, do not access or use the Site, App, Services or any information contained on them. These terms apply in addition to the terms of any client agreement (a “client Agreement”) between you and Vanco. In the event of a conflict between these terms and the terms of client Agreement, these terms will govern with respect to your use of the Site.**

**Changes.**

Vanco may make changes to the Site, including any content, features and services available through the Site, at any time. Vanco can change, update, or add or remove provisions of these Terms, at any time by posting the updated Terms on this Site, or by notifying registered users at their email address of record or other means. By using this Site after Vanco has updated the Terms, you are agreeing to all the updated Terms; if you do not agree with any of the updated Terms, you must stop using the Site.

**General Use.**

By using this Site, you represent, acknowledge and agree that you are at least 18 years of age. If you are not at least 18 years old, you may not use the Site at any time or in any manner or submit any information to the Vanco or the Site. If you are accepting these Terms on behalf of a legal entity, then you represent and warrant that you have the authority to do so and that your acceptance of the Terms on behalf of the legal entity is legally binding.

Vanco provides content through the Site that is copyrighted and/or trademarked work of Vanco or Vanco’s third-party licensors and suppliers or other users of the Site (collectively, the “**Materials**”). Materials may include logos, graphics, video, images, software and other content.

Subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms, and your compliance with these Terms, Vanco hereby grants you a limited, non-exclusive and non-transferable license to use and to display the Materials and to use this Site. Except for the foregoing license, you have no other rights in the Site or any Materials and you may not modify, edit, copy, reproduce, create derivative works of, reverse engineer, alter, enhance or in any way exploit any of the Site or Materials in any manner.

If you breach any of these Terms, the above license will terminate automatically and you must immediately destroy any downloaded or printed Materials.

**Mobile Apps.**

Vanco makes available Apps to access the Site or certain Services via a mobile device. To use the App, you must have a mobile device that is compatible with the mobile service. We do not warrant that the App will be compatible with your mobile device. We hereby grant to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use an object code copy of the App for one registered account on one mobile device owned or leased solely by you. You may not: (i) modify, disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer the App, except to the extent that such restriction is expressly prohibited by law; (ii) rent, lease, loan, resell, sublicense, distribute or otherwise transfer the App to any third-party or use the App to provide time sharing or similar services for any third-party; (iii) make any copies of the App; (iv) remove, circumvent, disable, damage or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the App, features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content accessible through the App, or features that enforce limitations on use of the App; or (v) delete the copyright and other proprietary rights notices on the App. You acknowledge that we may from time to time issue upgraded versions of the App, and may automatically electronically upgrade the version of the App that you are using on your mobile device. You consent to such automatic upgrading on your mobile device, and agree that these Terms will apply to all such upgrades. The foregoing license grant is not a sale of the App or any copy thereof, and Vanco and its third-party licensors or suppliers retain all right, title, and interest in and to the App (and any copy of the App). Standard carrier data charges may apply to your use of the App.

The following additional terms and conditions apply with respect to any App that Vanco provides to you designed for use on an Apple iOS-powered mobile device (an “**iOS App**”):

– You acknowledge that these Terms are between you and Vanco only, and not with Apple, Inc. (“**Apple**”).

– Your use of Vanco’s iOS App must comply with Apple’s then-current App Store Terms of Service.

– Vanco, and not Apple, are solely responsible for our iOS App and the Services and Content available thereon. You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation to provide maintenance and support services with respect to our iOS App. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to our iOS App.

– You agree that Vanco, and not Apple, are responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third-party relating to our iOS App or your possession and/or use of our iOS App, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the iOS App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation, and all such claims are governed solely by these Terms and any law applicable to us as provider of the iOS App.

– You agree that Vanco, and not Apple, shall be responsible, to the extent required by these Terms, for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any third-party intellectual property infringement claim related to our iOS App or your possession and use of our iOS App.

– You represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) You are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.

– You agree to comply with all applicable third-party terms of agreement when using our iOS App (e.g., you must not be in violation of your wireless data service terms of agreement when using the iOS App).

The parties agree that Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries to these Terms as they relate to your license of Vanco’s iOS App. Upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as they relate to your license of the iOS App as a third-party beneficiary thereof.

The following additional terms and conditions apply with respect to any App that we provide to you designed for use on an Android-powered mobile device (an “**Android App**”):

– You acknowledge that these Terms are between you and Vanco only, and not with Google, Inc. (“**Google**”).

– Your use of Vanco’s Android App must comply with Google’s then-current Android Market Terms of Service.

– Google is only a provider of the Android Market where you obtained the Android App. Vanco, and not Google, are solely responsible for Vanco’s Android App and the Services and Content available thereon. Google has no obligation or liability to you with respect to Vanco’s Android App or these Terms.

– You acknowledge and agree that Google is a third-party beneficiary to the Terms as they relate to Vanco’s Android App.
