1. **3\. The Mirror**

The Mirror is an all-in-one game development platform designed to offer a comprehensive suite of tools and services for both gamers and developers alike. The platform enables users to engage in a variety of activities, including playing and developing games (“**Games**”) and creating digital assets (“**Assets**”).  Any content uploaded or created by a user on the platform is categorized as User-Generated Content (“**UGC**”).

Upon registration, each user is allocated a unique virtual environment, referred to as, a “**Space**.”  Within this Space, users have the capability to create, manage, and deploy Assets and Games.  The Space serves as a personalized hub for all your game development and gaming activities.

Additionally, Assets can be exchanged through the Mirror Marketplace; providing users with an avenue to monetize their Assets.  Games developed on the platform can also be published and monetized in a variety of ways, offering developers multiple revenue streams.

1. **3.1 Asset and Game Development Guidelines**

**Content Restrictions**

When creating Assets or Games on the Platform, you must adhere to the following content restrictions:

* No sexually explicit or pornographic material;
* No offensive, disrespectful, or hate speech;

* No harassment, bullying, or threats;
* No promotion of illegal or harmful activities;

**Game Monetization**

Games you develop can be published on the Mirror.  You have control over the pricing and business model of your Game; whether it’s free-to-play, freemium, or premium.  Revenue generated from the Game, after accounting for transaction fees taken by the Mirror, will also be paid to you through a designated cash-out process.

**Transaction Fees and Taxes**

Each transaction on the Mirror is subject to a fee payable by the purchaser.  This fee will be automatically deducted and applied to your account before the cash-out process.  You are solely responsible for all sales, use, value-added, and other taxes (collectively, “**Taxes**”) associated with your use of the Mirror, including any Taxes arising from the transfer or sale of Assets and/or Games.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you will indemnify, defend and hold harmless TMM and our subsidiaries and affiliates, and each of our respective officers, directors, agents, partners and employees (individually and collectively, the “**Mirror Parties**”) from and against any losses, liabilities, claims, demands, damages, expenses or costs (“**Claims**”) arising out of or related to (a) your access to or use of the Services; (b) your User Content or Feedback; (c) your violation of these Terms; (d) your violation, misappropriation or infringement of any rights of another (including intellectual property rights or privacy rights); or (e) your conduct in connection with the Services.  You agree to cooperate with TMM Parties in defending such Claims and pay all fees, costs and expenses associated with defending such Claims (including, but not limited to, attorneys’ fees).  TMM Parties will have control of the defense or settlement, at TMM’s sole option, of any third-party Claims.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, TMM and the other Mirror Parties will not be liable to you under any theory of liability—whether based in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, warranty, or otherwise—for any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, punitive, or special damages or lost profits, even if TMM or the other Mirror Parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages.

The total liability of TMM and the other Mirror Parties for any claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Services, regardless of the form of the action, is limited to the greater of\[$100 or the amount paid by you to use our Services.

The limitations set forth in this Section 10 will not limit or exclude liability for the gross negligence, fraud or intentional misconduct of TMM or the other Mirror Parties or for any other matters in which liability cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.  Additionally, some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you release TMM and the other Mirror Parties from responsibility, liability, claims, demands and/or damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown (including claims of negligence), arising out of or related to disputes between users and the acts or omissions of third parties.  If you are a consumer who resides in California, you hereby waive your rights under California Civil Code § 1542, which provides: “_A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor._”

1. **12\. Transfer and Processing Data**

In order for us to provide our Services, you agree that we may process, transfer and store information about you in the United States and other countries, where you may not have the same rights and protections as you do under local law.

1. **14\. Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration**

**PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH TMM AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US, UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION BY FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS SET FORTH BELOW. NO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS OR ARBITRATIONS ARE ALLOWED UNDER THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION. IN ADDITION, ARBITRATION PRECLUDES YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR HAVING A JURY TRIAL.**

1. **14.1 No Representative Actions**

. You and TMM agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms, or our Services is personal to you and TMM and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.

1. **14.2 Arbitration of Disputes**

. Except for small claims disputes in which you or TMM seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or disputes in which you or TMM seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property, **you and TMM waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any other dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services, including claims related to privacy and data security, (collectively, “Disputes”) resolved in court**.  Instead, for any Dispute that you have against TMM you agree to first contact TMM and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim (“**Notice**”) to TMM by email at [legal@themirror.space](mailto:legal@themirror.space) or by certified mail addressed to 7901 4th St N, Suite 15196 St. Petersburg, FL 33702.  The Notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the Dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought.  Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above.  If you and TMM cannot reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the Dispute to binding arbitration administered by JAMS; or under the limited circumstances set forth above, in court.  All Disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator.  Arbitration proceedings will be held in New Castle County, Delaware unless you are a consumer, in which case you may elect to hold the arbitration in your county of residence.  For purposes of this Section 14, a “**consumer**” means a person using the Services for personal, family or household purposes.  You and TMM agree that Disputes will be held in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“**JAMS Rules**”).  The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on the [JAMS website](https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/) and are hereby incorporated by reference.  You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.

1. **14.3** You and TMM agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce, and that the enforceability of this Section 14 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the “**FAA**”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.  As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability.  The arbitrator may conduct only individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding, or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.
2. **14.4** The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute.  The arbitrator, TMM, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments, and awards, including information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the Dispute(s) therein.  The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality unless the law provides to the contrary.  The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.  
3. **14.5** You and TMM agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee (up to a maximum of $250 if you are a consumer), and TMM will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs.  For any arbitration initiated by TMM, TMM will pay all JAMS fees and costs.  You and TMM agree that the state or federal courts of the State of Delaware and the United States sitting in New Castle County, Delaware have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.
4. **14.6 Any Dispute must be filed within one year after the relevant claim arose; otherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred, which means that you and TMM will not have the right to assert the claim.**
5. **14.7 You have the right to opt-out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 14 by email to** [**legal@themirror.space**](mailto:legal@themirror.space).
6. **14.8** In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt-out of binding arbitration.  By opting-out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with this Section 14.
7. **14.9** If any portion of this Section 14 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 14 or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section 14; and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.  Further, if any part of this Section 14 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 14 will be enforceable.
8. **15\. Governing Law and Venue**

Any dispute arising from these Terms and your use of the Services will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Delaware, except to the extent preempted by U.S. federal law, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.  Any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of Delaware and the United States, respectively, sitting in New Castle County, Delaware.

1. **16\. Modifying and Terminating our Services**

We reserve the right to modify our Services or to suspend or stop providing all or portions of our Services at any time.  You also have the right to stop using our Services at any time.  We are not responsible for any loss or harm related to your inability to access or use our Services.

1. **17\. Severability**

If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms is unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

1. **18\. Miscellaneous**

The failure of TMM to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.  These Terms reflect the entire agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, representations, statements, and understandings of the parties.  The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.  Use of the word “**including**” will be interpreted to mean “**including without limitation**.”  Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.  You agree that communications and transactions between us may be conducted electronically.
