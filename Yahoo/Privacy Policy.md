Welcome to the Oath Privacy Center

_In June 2017, we announced that Yahoo and AOL had joined to become Oath, a digital and mobile media company and part of Verizon.  We’re now bringing Oath and Yahoo under a single privacy policy.  Some things haven’t changed, like the control tools we provide to help you manage your experience with us.  If you have an existing Yahoo or AOL account, you will need to agree to this Privacy Policy.  If you have not yet agreed to this Privacy Policy, the legacy Yahoo Privacy Policy or legacy Oath Privacy Policy (for AOL) still apply to your account.  For Oath products or services that are accessed without signing into an account, this Privacy Policy applies to those products and services starting May 25, 2018.  If you are creating a new account, the terms below apply starting today._ 

_Last updated: April 2018_

Our Privacy Pledge

Our commitment is to put users first.  We strive to be transparent about how we collect and use your information, to keep your information secure and to provide you meaningful choices.  This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information Oath, its affiliates and its house of global brands (“Oath,” “us,” “our” or “we”) collect, why we collect it and what we do with it. This policy applies to Oath brands, websites, apps, advertising services, products, services or technologies (we’ll collectively refer to these as “Services”).  Additional privacy practices for certain Services can be found in Details for Specific Products and Services.

Your Controls

We believe you should have tools to control your information. You can find controls to manage or review your account information, marketing preferences, location data, and search history at Privacy Controls.  Some of our Services provide additional controls and privacy practices.  (See, Details for Specific Products and Services)
