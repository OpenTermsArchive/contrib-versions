Yahoo Privacy Centre
====================

_Yahoo is now part of [’Oath’](https://www.oath.com/), a digital and mobile media company with more than 50 [brands](https://www.oath.com/our-brands/) globally, and a member of the [Verizon family of companies](https://www.verizon.com/about/our-company/who-we-are). As of 18 September 2017, we plan to share some information with [Oath and the Verizon family of companies](https://policies.yahoo.com/ie/en/yahoo/privacy/topics/affiliates/index.html) that will allow us to provide more customised advertising, engaging content and innovative products, as well as for other analytics purposes. To learn more about what information we may share and the options available to you to manage your information, please review our [FAQs](https://policies.yahoo.com/ie/en/yahoo/privacy/euoathnoticefaq/index.html)._

_Your privacy is important to Yahoo, Oath and Verizon. How Yahoo handles your personal data and what personal data we share with [third parties](https://policies.yahoo.com/ie/en/yahoo/privacy/topics/thirdparties/index.html) outside of [the Oath/Verizon family of companies](https://policies.yahoo.com/ie/en/yahoo/privacy/topics/affiliates/index.html) has not changed. The Yahoo EMEA [Terms of Service](https://policies.yahoo.com/52jppi382cpq) and Privacy Policy as set out below continue to govern when you are on a Yahoo site, using a Yahoo app or interacting with our products, services or technologies._

_Integration of Yahoo into the new Oath organisation is an ongoing process. We are carefully managing your data during this period of transition and we will notify you in accordance with the Privacy Policy below as and when additional significant changes occur._

Welcome to the Yahoo Privacy Centre – take a look around. You'll learn how Yahoo treats your personal information, as well as ways to control your preferences and settings. As always, Yahoo is committed to gaining your trust.

**What this Privacy Policy covers**
-----------------------------------

This Privacy Policy covers Yahoo's treatment of personally identifiable and other information that Yahoo collects and receives, including information related to your past use of Yahoo products and services. “Data” and “information” includes information about you that is personally identifiable, such as your name, address, email address or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. Where applicable, we explicitly point out the use of personally identifiable data within our privacy policies. All other data is anonymous to us or is used pseudonymously. 

The Privacy Policy also provides information about cookies, Yahoo's and third parties' use of cookies, and how you can disable such cookies.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Yahoo does not own or control, or to people that Yahoo does not employ or manage. In addition, some companies that Yahoo has acquired have their own pre-existing privacy policies. You can find more information on the [affiliates page](https://policies.yahoo.com/ie/en/yahoo/privacy/topics/affiliates/index.html).

In the “Topics” section, you can find detailed information on special topics such as cookies and IP addresses. In the “Products” section, you can find additional guidance about our privacy practices relating to particular products or services.

"Yahoo” means Oath (EMEA) (Limited formerly known as Yahoo! EMEA Limited) which operates within and is subject to Irish data protection law. However, if you are a Sky | Yahoo Mail user, "Yahoo" means Yahoo UK Services Limited in relation to your use of Mail, Messenger (in webmail), Calendar and Addresses. If you are a BT | Yahoo Mail user, “Yahoo” means Yahoo! UK Services Limited which provides Mail, Messenger (in webmail), Calendar and Addresses as a data processor for BT customers.

**Information collection & use**
--------------------------------

Yahoo (as data controller) collects personally identifiable information when you register for a Yahoo account, when you use certain Yahoo products or services, when you enter promotions or competitions and when you visit Yahoo pages or the pages of certain Yahoo partners outside the branded Yahoo network of websites. Yahoo may combine information (including personally identifiable information) about you that we have with information that we obtain from business partners or other companies.

When you register with Yahoo, we ask for personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, postcode, occupation, industry and personal interests.

Yahoo collects information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners, including information about your use of financial products and services that we offer.

Yahoo also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your [IP address](https://policies.yahoo.com/ie/en/yahoo/privacy/topics/ipaddress/index.html), Yahoo [cookie](https://policies.yahoo.com/ie/en/yahoo/privacy/topics/cookies/index.html) information, software and hardware attributes, and the page that you requested. Once you register with Yahoo and sign in to our services, you are no longer anonymous to us and your usage data will be connected to your account.

Yahoo uses information (including anonymous and pseudonymous information, as well as personally identifiable information) for the following general purposes: to personalise the advertising and content that you see, fulfil your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.

**Data transfer**
-----------------

Your personal information may be transferred to countries other than your own, especially to servers in the United States, to process and store data in accordance with our Privacy Policy and to provide you with products and services. Some of these countries may not have the same data protection safeguards as the country where you reside. By using our products and services, you consent to us transferring your data to these countries. We are committed to ensuring that your information is protected and we apply safeguards in accordance with applicable law, including using data processing agreements based on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses. You can find more information about this in the [Data transfer topic](https://policies.yahoo.com/ie/en/yahoo/privacy/topics/datatransfer/index.html).

**Information sharing & disclosure**
------------------------------------

Yahoo does not rent, sell or share information about you (including personally identifiable information) with other people or non-affiliated companies, except to provide products or services that you have requested, when we have your permission or in the following circumstances:

*   to provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Yahoo under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use such information to help Yahoo communicate with you (to the extent consented by you) about offers from Yahoo and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
*   to respond to subpoenas, court orders, legal process or to any legitimate request by authorities with which compliance is required, or to establish or exercise legal rights or defend against legal claims.
*   to share, when we believe it is necessary, such information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Yahoo's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
*   to transfer such information about you if Yahoo acquires, or is acquired by or merged with, another company. In this event, Yahoo will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

Yahoo displays targeted advertisements based on anonymised or pseudonymised data and information, and Yahoo may also display targeted advertisements based on personally identifiable information. Advertisers (including ad-serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria – for example, females aged 18-24 from a particular geographic area. Yahoo does not provide any personally identifiable information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad, you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.

**Cookies & similar technologies**
----------------------------------

Yahoo may set and access Yahoo [cookies](https://policies.yahoo.com/ie/en/yahoo/privacy/topics/cookies/index.html) on your computer. We may also set and access device identifiers which could include IP address, user agent information (browser version, OS type and version) and device-provided identifiers. Once you log in to Yahoo on your device, Yahoo may recognise your device to provide you with a personalised experience, independent of your device settings. You can control your personalised experience across Yahoo through our [Ad Interest Manager](https://policies.yahoo.com/4tep2uzsjuf6). [Learn more](https://policies.yahoo.com/ie/en/yahoo/privacy/topics/cookies/index.html#device-personalization).

Yahoo lets [other companies](https://policies.yahoo.com/ie/en/yahoo/privacy/topics/thirdparties/index.html) that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies and device identifiers is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to Yahoo's cookies.

Yahoo uses [web beacons](https://policies.yahoo.com/ie/en/yahoo/privacy/topics/webbeacons/index.html) to access Yahoo cookies inside and outside our network of websites and in connection with Yahoo products and services.

**Your ability to edit & delete your account information & preferences**
------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can edit your [Yahoo account information](http://edit.yahoo.com/config/eval_profile), including your [marketing preferences](https://subs.communications.yahoo.com/unsubscribe_all.html?c=1111?), at any time.

New categories of marketing communications might be added to the Marketing preferences page from time to time. Users who visit this page can opt out of receiving future marketing communications from these new categories or they can unsubscribe by following instructions contained in the messages that they receive.

We reserve the right to send you certain communications, such as service announcements and administrative messages and other communications relating to the Yahoo service, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.

You may delete your Yahoo account by visiting our [Account deletion](https://edit.yahoo.com/config/delete_user) page, verifying your password once more and confirming your choice to terminate the account. Please [click here](https://policies.yahoo.com/ie/en/yahoo/privacy/topics/datastorage/index.html) to read about what information may possibly temporarily remain in our archived records after your account has been deleted.

**Confidentiality & security**
------------------------------

We limit access to information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.

We have physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with our legal obligations to protect information about you.

To learn more about security, including the security steps we have taken and security steps you can take, please read [Security at Yahoo](https://policies.yahoo.com/ie/en/yahoo/privacy/topics/security/index.html).

**Posting on publicly accessible areas**
----------------------------------------

A publicly accessible area is any area of Yahoo that is accessible by the general public and may be indexed by search engines.

Yahoo allows you to post, submit and exchange content and information on publicly accessible areas, such as Yahoo Groups, Yahoo Message Boards and Yahoo Answers.

You should exercise caution if you choose to disclose personally identifiable information in a publicly accessible area. Remember that this information may remain indefinitely in the publicly accessible area of the service. Also, depending on the particular service, other users may also be able to view two or more of your individual postings collectively.

You are solely responsible for any information that you disclose and disseminate on publicly accessible areas.

If you have a concern about any personally identifiable information that you have posted on any publicly accessible areas and are unable to delete or edit it, please refer your query to [Customer Care](http://help.yahoo.com/help/uk/abuse).

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**
----------------------------------

Yahoo may amend this policy from time to time. If we make any substantial changes in the way we use your information, we will notify you by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your Yahoo account or by posting a prominent notice on our pages.
