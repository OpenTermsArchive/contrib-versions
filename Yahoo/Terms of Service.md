1.  **YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH YAHOO  
      
    **
    1.  Welcome to Yahoo. Yahoo provides the Yahoo Services (described below) to you under these Terms of Service ("Terms"). In these Terms "you" means the individual using the Yahoo Services. "Yahoo" means Oath (EMEA) Limited (a company incorporated in Ireland, formerly known as Yahoo! EMEA Limited).
    2.  When you use the Yahoo Services, you can access services provided by other Yahoo group companies and companies outside the Yahoo group. Yahoo is not responsible for services it does not provide. The terms of service governing a service should always explain who provides the service. You should always look at the terms of service that apply to each service you use especially when you register for a service. The Yahoo terms can usually be found via a link at the bottom of each page of the Yahoo Services.
2.  **ACCEPTING THE TERMS  
      
    **
    1.  By using the Yahoo Services, you agree to follow these Terms. These Terms also include the following guidelines and terms:
        1.  Online guidelines
        2.  Additional Terms of Service. See the full list of the [Additional Terms of Service](https://policies.yahoo.com/ie/en/yahoo/terms/index.html) that apply to specific Yahoo Services.
    2.  If any of these documents contradict each other, the terms will apply in this order: Additional Terms of Service, Terms, online guidelines
    3.  You may not use the Yahoo Services and may not accept the Terms if you are a person barred from receiving the Yahoo Services under the laws of Ireland or other applicable laws.
    4.  These Terms form a legally binding agreement between you and Yahoo in relation to your use of the Yahoo Services. It is important that you take the time to read them carefully. You can always access the current version of the Terms [here](https://policies.yahoo.com/ie/en/yahoo/terms/utos/index.html).
3.  **THE YAHOO SERVICES** 
    1.  Yahoo provides to you a rich collection of online resources, including, various communication, search and information tools, community forums and social networking services, content, media and entertainment services through its network of properties which may be accessed through various media or devices now known or developed afterwards (the "Yahoo Services").
    2.  The Yahoo Services may include important communications from Yahoo, such as service announcements and administrative messages. These communications are considered part of the Yahoo membership and you will not be able to opt out of receiving them.
4.  **REGISTRATION & ACCOUNT SECURITY  
      
    **
    1.  You agree to provide accurate and complete information about yourself when required by the Yahoo Services' registration form (the "Registration Data") and ensure your Registration Data is kept up to date.
    2.  Yahoo will issue you with a password and a Yahoo ID when you complete the Yahoo Services' registration process. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and security of your account. Accordingly, you are solely responsible for all activities that occur under your account. You will:
        1.  immediately notify Yahoo of any unauthorised use of your account and any other breach of security; and
        2.  ensure that you sign out from your account at the end of each session.
5.  **ADVICE FOR CHILDREN  
      
    **
    1.  Yahoo is concerned about the safety and privacy of all its users, particularly children. For this reason, parents who wish to allow their children access to the Yahoo Services should assist them in setting up accounts, supervise their access to the Yahoo Services and determine as legal guardians whether any of the Yahoo Services and its content are appropriate for them. By allowing their child access to the Yahoo Services, parents acknowledge and accept that they will be able to access all of the Yahoo Services including email, communities and social networking services.
    2.  In any case, it is our policy not to allow children who are registered with Yahoo as under 13 years of age to use social networking services provided by Yahoo.
6.  **PRIVACY & DATA DISCLOSURE** 
    1.  Registration Data and other information about you and your use of Yahoo Services will be processed in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
