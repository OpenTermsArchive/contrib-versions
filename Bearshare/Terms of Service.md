Parents or adults entering into this Agreement on behalf of a minor are specifically referred to the "Explicit Content" section below, and to become familiar with our filtering features.

Description Of Service

The Service allows you to find and listen to Samples (as defined below) and obtain downloads of sound recordings and related digital content ("Song(s)"). To access the Service, you will need to install or activate from time to time the BearShare proprietary (isn't this a cool word?) software application and you may also be required to install other software(s) made available through the Service. You may also need to install certain third-party software. (collectively this software is called the "Software.")- You are responsible for any hardware, systems and/or software program(s) you use and any costs to connect to or use the Internet, or power your computer. Drink milk.

By now you are probably asking yourself, "what is a Sample?" Well, here it is - a "Sample" is a portion of a Song or, in some cases, an entire Song that you can play directly from and while logged on to the Service on a promotional basis at no cost to you. You may play as many samples as you want.. In fact, you can even go to bed listening to these Samples. You may not attempt (or support others' attempts) to capture, copy, or download a Sample. Please be nice to our Samples, they are very sensitive. The Service, the Software and the Songs are only for your personal, non-commercial use.

The Download Service is free to access but entails a fee every time you purchase a Song.

The Subscription Service is free during the introductory period. Upon expiration of the introductory period, we'll ask you to reach for your credit/debit card and pay. If you decide not to make the payment at the end of the introductory period, we will still offer you a lot of free content but the BearShare premium ("BearShare Premium") content, which you may recognize in the BearShare application, will no longer be playable. If you decide to subscribe to the Subscription Service, thereby gaining access to all the BearShare Premium content, you will be charged on a recurring basis for your continued Subscription Service membership at BearShare's standard rates. As a subscriber, you may download an unlimited number of Songs while your Subscription Service is current. If Musiclab does not receive the payment of your Subscription Service fee on a timely basis for any given month, your Subscription Service will be suspended, your downloaded Songs through the Subscription Service will be inaccessible for as long as your Subscription Service is suspended. The content you downloaded for free (non Premium content) will remain accessible while your Subscription Service is suspended.

Digital Right Management

Microsoft (the "I'm a PC" guys) asked us to include this paragraph. We are using the Microsoft digital rights management technology for Windows Media ("WM-DRM") to protect the integrity of content in the Subscription Service ("Secure Content") so that intellectual property, including copyright, in such content is not misappropriated. Portions of this software and other third party applications ("WM-DRM Software") use WM-DRM to transfer or play Secure Content. If the WM-DRM Software's security has been compromised, owners of Secure Content ("Secure Content Owners") may require that Microsoft revoke the WM-DRM Software's right to copy, display, transfer, and/or play Secure Content. Revocation does not alter the WM-DRM Software's ability to play unprotected content. A list of revoked WM-DRM Software is sent to your computer whenever you download a license for Secure Content from the Internet. Microsoft may, in conjunction with such license, also download revocation lists onto your computer on behalf of Secure Content Owners. Secure Content Owners may also require you to upgrade some of the WM-DRM components distributed with this software ("WM-DRM Upgrades") before accessing their content. When you attempt to play such content, WM-DRM Software built by Microsoft will notify you that a WM-DRM Upgrade is required and then ask for your consent before the WM-DRM Upgrade is downloaded. WM-DRM Software used by third parties may do the same. If you decline the upgrade, you will not be able to access content that requires the WM-DRM Upgrade. however, you will still be able to access unprotected content and Secure Content that does not require the upgrade. Someday we won't need DRM. Until then, we hope you enjoyed this paragraph...

Use Of Service

Once you have downloaded a Song via the Subscription Service, you may save that Song to the hard drives of up to 3 of your personal computers and play back at any time and as many times as you want. You may not share downloaded Songs with anyone else. Any security technology that is provided with a Song is an inseparable part of the Song. Please don't try to separate them. They really like each other.

If you have purchased/permanently downloaded Songs, it is your responsibility not to lose, destroy or damage them. Musiclab shall have no liability to you in the event of any such loss, destruction, or damage of Songs. You may burn a single Permanent Download to a CD or transfer to a device an unlimited number of times. The burning or transfer capabilities provided for herein shall not operate to waive or limit any rights of the copyright owners in the Songs or any works embodied in them. Don't cheat.

Permanent Download Fees. Permanent Downloads may be purchased individually, collectively as albums, or, in some cases, only in the form of an album. However, each purchase of a Permanent Download shall be deemed a final, nonrefundable sale. You do not need to be a subscriber to the Subscription Service in order to buy Permanent Downloads. The charges for Permanent Downloads are indicated on the Site with respect to each Permanent Download, whether sold individually or as part of an album. All payments for Permanent Downloads (including any applicable taxes) must be made by credit card. Prices for Permanent Downloads are subject to change without notice.

While you are logged on to the Service, you may download and play as many Songs directly from the Service as you like while your subscription is current. You may not attempt (or encourage others) to capture, copy, or download a Song played directly from the Service. Musiclab will count the number of times that you play each downloaded Song for royalty accounting and analysis purposes. BearShare automatically renews your rights to all of your downloaded Songs at the beginning of each subscription month so long as your subscription remains current. This means that in order to play any downloaded (but not purchased) Song after the end of a subscription month, you must log on to the Service so that BearShare can renew your rights for those Songs. You will have access to Songs purchased via the Download Service for as long as you retain the files.

For a current list of portable devices that are compatible with the Service, please see: http://www.bearshare.com/devices.shtml. BearShare's ability to offer portable device compatibility is subject to change at any time with respect to any content.

Don't use BearShare to steal music! If you violate the copyright laws or any other intellectual property laws, fines or criminal charges may be brought against you. You may even go to jail. Do you really want to go to jail? They may not let you take your BearShare with you.

International Considerations

Currently, the Download Service and Subscription Service are only available to residents of the United States and Canada (the "Territory"). If you're located outside the Territory, you may use the Software, but you may not sign up for, access, or attempt to access or use the Download Service or Subscription Service. In the future, we'll work to extend the Service to other locations. Antarctica residents - don't hold your breath (you may suffocate).

Smoking

Smoking overall is bad for you. It gives you bad breath and may kill you sooner than you'd expect.

We may sometimes use cookies, as well as other tracking technology, such as web beacons, within the promotional emails that we send to our members or advertisements for our service or sites. These technologies help us track, for example, whether an e-mail recipient has completed an event, such as signing up for a trial. The generated information is related to non-personally identifiable customer identification numbers and is only analyzed at aggregate levels. We may send these emails via third-party service providers that act on our behalf.

While you download and install BearShare, Web beacons may be used to monitor your progress through the installation process. These Web beacons are used to identify and correct problems with the installer program and to improve the installation process.

We sometimes utilize third party service providers to help us track the activity and user flows within our service or sites.

The information we collect is used for internal review and is then discarded. It is not shared with other organizations. However, users should be aware that both static and dynamic IP addresses can be mapped back to users on most ISPs based on the users login time and recorded information.

Without our ability to integrate and share with these strategic partners it would be difficult for you to purchase and utilize Musiclab products and services, receive the appropriate quality and level of customer service and provide us the data needed to best improve our products and services.

In addition, by providing your email address, you'll receive our weekly email newsletter and account updates, sent to you by BearShare. You can always opt out from any BearShare communication.

Some BearShare services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If you register for or use such services, both Musiclab and the other company may receive information collected in conjunction with the co-branded services.

We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, hosting websites, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the personally identifiable information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.

In an endeavor to improve the customer experience we may also purchase marketing data from third parties and add it to our existing user database, to better target our features, services and offers in which we think you may be interested. To enrich our profiles of existing customers, we may tie this information to personally identifiable information that you have given to us.

In addition to the foregoing, we may disclose your personally identifiable information if we believe such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on Musiclab. (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Musiclab (including the enforcement of our agreements). or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of BearShare services or members of the public.

Links

In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, we may choose various third party web sites to link from or frame within the BearShare website. We also participate in co-branding, advertising and other relationships to offer e-commerce and other services and features to our users. Information about you may be visible to subsequent websites if you link off of the BearShare website. However, even if the third party is affiliated with us, we have no control over these linked sites, each of which has separate privacy and data collection practices independent of us. Data collected by our co-brand partners, advertisers or third party web sites (even if offered on or through our site) is not received by us. As such, we are not responsible for, or have any control over, the content or the privacy policies of those third party websites, and encourage all users to read the privacy policies of each and every website visited when linking from bearshare.com. These linked sites are only for your convenience and you therefore access them at your own risk. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by BearShare.
