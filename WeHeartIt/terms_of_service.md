As such, you should only provide Content you are comfortable sharing under this Terms of Service.

**B.** The Services may include advertisements targeted to users, Content or queries made through the Services, or other information. The types and extent of advertising by us on the Services are subject to change. In consideration for us granting you access to and use of the Services, you agree that we and our third-party providers and partners may place such advertising on the Services or in connection with the display of Content or information from the Services whether submitted by you or others.

You further agree that Content you Post to the Services will not contain third-party copyrighted material, or material that is subject to other third-party rights (including rights relating to publicity and privacy), unless you have permission from the rightful owner of the material or you are otherwise legally entitled to Post the material and to grant We Heart It all of the license rights granted herein.

**B.** Any use or reliance on Content Posted using the Services or obtained by you through the Services, including any Content you Reheart, is at your own risk.

**D.** The Services may contain links to third-party websites that are not owned or controlled by us. Functionality of the Services may also permit interactions between the Services and third-party applications or features, including applications that connect the Services or your profile with a third-party website or feature.

We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies or practices of any third-party website, service, feature or application. In addition, we will not and cannot censor or edit the content of any third-party website, service, feature or application. By using the Services, you expressly relieve us of any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website, service, feature or application. Accordingly, we encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each other website that you visit. Your correspondence and dealings with third parties in connection with the Services are solely between you and such third parties.

**E.** We reserve the right to remove hosted content and take technical and legal steps to bar users from our Website and/or the Services if we believe them to be in violation of this Terms of Service.

V. CONTENT OWNERSHIP AND GRANT OF RIGHTS
----------------------------------------

**A.** We Heart It and/or its third-party licensors retain ownership of all intellectual property rights in this Website, the Services and any software, mobile applications, web browser extensions and/or bookmarklets made available to you in connection with the Services. However, we do not claim any ownership in the Content you or our other users Post.

**B.** So that We Heart It can operate, maintain, market and improve our Website, our mobile applications and our Services and our users can use and enjoy the same, when you Post Content through our Services (including any Content you have Hearted), you give We Heart It, its affiliates and its third-party providers and partners a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable right and license to use, host, store, cache, reproduce, publish, display (publicly or otherwise), perform (publicly or otherwise), distribute, transmit, modify, adapt (including, without limitation, in order to conform it to the requirements of any networks, devices, services, or media through which the Services are available), copy and create derivative works of such Content (either alone or as part of a collective work). As part of the foregoing license grant (the "User Content License"), and without limiting the User Content License, you agree that (i) the other users of our Services shall have the right to comment on your Content and/or to use, publish, display, modify or include a copy of your Content as part of their own user profile and Hearted Content ("ReHearting") and (ii) we have the right to make any of your publicly-Posted Content available to third parties, so that those third parties can distribute, make derivative works of, comment on and/or analyze your Content on other media and services (either alone or as part of a collective work). For the avoidance of doubt, you agree that our third-party content providers, partners and advertisers may display or feature any Content that you Post through our Services in their own Content and promotional material on our Website, including in their profiles on our Website.

**C.** Because of the social nature of Content shared through our Services, when you Post something publicly on our Website or through our Services, others may choose to add descriptive commentary and tags to your Content and/or to ReHeart your Content, making your Content part of a social conversation that cannot later be erased without retroactively censoring the speech of others and/or removing Content from another user’s profile. You may adjust your privacy settings to make certain portions of your profile private, but the content that you post will still be available through our Services, and others may choose to add descriptive commentary and tags to your Content and/or to ReHeart your Content. As such, and in order to maintain the integrity of the Services, you agree that the rights that you have granted under the User Content License will continue to survive in perpetuity even if you stop using the Services or your account is otherwise terminated.

**D.** Upon termination of your Account or upon your deletion of any Content from the Services, We Heart It shall make reasonable efforts to disassociate such Content from your User Account; however, you acknowledge and agree that: (a) caching of, copies of, or references to such Content may not be immediately removed; (b) such removed Content may persist in backups for a reasonable period of time; and (c) such removed Content may continue to be publicly available (and stored on our or third party servers) through the accounts of other users, if the same has been ReHearted.

XII. Governing Law; Dispute Resolution
--------------------------------------

In order to expedite and control the cost of disputes, you and We Heart It agree that any legal or equitable claim relating to this Terms of Service (referred to as a "Claim") will be resolved as set forth in this Section XII.

**A.** Informal Resolution. You and We Heart It agree that we will first try to resolve any Claim informally. Accordingly, neither of us may start a formal proceeding for at least thirty (30) days after one of us notifies the other of a Claim in writing. We Heart It will send its notice to your email address. You will send your notice to hello@weheartit.com.

**B.** Arbitration. Please read this carefully. It affects your rights. We Heart It and you (such references include our respective predecessors in interest, successors and assigns) agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims arising out of or relating to this Terms of Service between We Heart It and you. The arbitration shall be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Terms of Service, and shall be administered by the AAA. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this arbitration clause, but the arbitrator is bound by this Terms of Service. Except as otherwise provided for herein, We Heart It will pay all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought is improper or not warranted, as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), then the payment of all such fees shall be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse We Heart It for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator grants relief to you that is equal to or greater than the value of your demand, We Heart It shall reimburse you for your reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses incurred for the arbitration. You agree that, by entering into this Terms of Service, you and We Heart It are waiving the right to a trial by jury. You and We Heart It agree that YOU AND We Heart It MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Further, you agree that the arbitrator may not consolidate proceedings or more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding, and that if this specific proviso is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration clause shall be null and void.

**C.** Formal Resolution. If we cannot resolve a Claim informally, you and We Heart It each agree to submit to personal jurisdiction in New York and agree that any and all Claims either of us asserts shall be exclusively brought in the appropriate state or federal court in the Southern District of the State of New York, provided that neither you nor We Heart It shall be precluded from filing a Claim in small claims court, regardless of whether such small claims court is located in New York, for disputes within the jurisdiction of a small claims court.

**D.** Governing Law and Jurisdictional Issues. This Terms of Service is governed in all respects by the substantive laws of the State of New York and of the United States of America. The UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly disclaimed. Those who choose to access our Website or our Services from other locations do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.
