### Safeguarding your data

#### How we protect your data

Finnair takes appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of your personal data and protect it against loss or unlawful use. Access to your personal data is restricted on a need-to-know basis and by access controls, and the processing of personal data is logged. Our information technology environment is appropriately protected and monitored, with regular updates, testing and assessment to ensure ongoing security. Our personnel are trained to comply with applicable data protection legislation as well as the applicable policies and instructions.

#### International data transfers

Your personal data may be transferred and processed outside of your home country and outside of the European Economic Area. The laws of these countries may not afford the same level of protection to your personal data.

In these cases, we have taken steps to ensure that appropriate and suitable safeguards are in place in order to comply with the requirements for international transfers of personal data under applicable law, such as using the [European Union Commission Standard Contractual Clauses](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32010D0087&from=EN) as a safeguard for the transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area.

We may also be obliged to transfer your personal data to foreign authorities, for example to customs or immigration authorities.

#### If something should go wrong

We do our best to keep your data safe and secure. If, however, there was a personal data breach that should endanger your privacy, we will inform you in accordance with the data protection legislation.

#### Your actions matter as well

To protect your own privacy, please avoid sharing your personal data, such as login information or travel documents, with others or on social media. Please pay special attention to your Finnair Plus account security and consider two-factor authentication as advanced security for your Finnair Plus or Finnair account. Please avoid sending copies of your identification documents or sensitive personal data (e.g. doctor's certificates) to us by unsecured email; instead, use web forms or other secure transfer methods provided by Finnair.

We process reservation, payment and baggage data to measure performance and to prevent fraudulent behaviour (see more in section How we use your data > Based on our legitimate interest > Background processes).

### How we use your data

#### Based on our contract with you

**Providing our services**

To create a booking, change a booking and identify all passengers onboard, we need the personal information of those travelling.

To provide you with services throughout your entire journey with us, your data will be processed at the airport at check-in and arrival, service desk, lounge, gate as well as on board. In case of irregularities, we need to reach out to our customers and, in case of the disruption of traffic, reroute the passengers and modify their bookings.

To deliver your baggage to your destination, we process the baggage handling details (e.g. tag codes, routing and possible security screenings).

In case of special service requests, we need to ensure you are provided with the correct service. For instance, your diet preference will be processed to ensure that you get the meal of your choice.

We assist you in queries related to your purchases such as flight reservations or shopping.

In order to help you with any questions, collect your feedback, handle your complaints, claims and refunds we use your personal data as necessary. We may also use your identification data to provide you with better service in disruption situations. We may send you confirmation and informative communication about your travel by email, SMS or other means.

We may save your contact information, reservation data, contacts and content of contacts in a customer account to be able to provide relevant customer service. This information may also be used to identify the customer when getting in touch with us. To keep you informed about your travel and itinerary, we will need to reach out to you using your contact details and process your booking details.

If you have enrolled in our other services, we will process the data provided during registration or booking in order to provide the requested service.

#### Based on our legitimate interest

**Communication and engagement**

We may process your personal data to send you service-related informational communications related to services you have purchased or registered for.

We may engage with you to voluntarily participate in developing our services. If you have participated in a survey, the results are used for analytics and can also be combined with other data in our database, such as reservation and flight data, for customer experience improvement purposes. You may be contacted after the survey for providing additional information. We may also contact a selected or limited group of persons to participate in testing our new products and services.

When processing personal data, we rely on our legitimate interest in maintaining business relationships and communicating with you about our operations and our events.

**Digital touchpoints**

Personal data, such as login details and site usage logs, are processed in connection with providing you services in our digital touchpoints, to ensure your identity, to identify you across the different touchpoints and to record usage. Functional cookies are employed to collect data from sessions to ensure the functioning of our online services. For more information on how we use cookies, please see our [cookie policy.](https://www.finnair.com/en/info/finnair-cookie-policy)

**Personalisation of services**

Aiming to continuously improve the customer experience and to make our offering more relevant to you, we may offer personalised service and content based on an individual transaction, for example offering services related to your destination. We may also perform customer segmentation, for instance for offering upgrades, ancillary services and retail products relevant to the customer through our digital touchpoints. We may also obtain other information from the individual transactions, such as the travel purpose.

By identifying the customer and their travel history, we can identify previous communications, past irregularities, purchased services and travel information. Accordingly, we can recognise the specific traveller’s needs and pay special attention to certain elements of the customer journey, experience and interactions. To identify the customer and create one unique customer profile, multiple records need to be linked, both for the same and across different transactions.

**Background processes**

As part of running our business, we may process personal data when carrying out certain background processes. For tickets, ancillaries and other purchases, we need to make sure bookings are created and ticketing is done in compliance with law and Finnair policies. These processes cover, for example, monitoring of fraudulent activities, such as credit card theft, false bookings, fraudulent claims, and auditing of fares and taxes.

For developing and improving our services further and to analyze our business performance, we follow traffic flows, commercial and operational performance and related customer behaviours. Transactional data is used in operational situations to determine, for example, how many people will be upgraded or offloaded.

#### Based on your consent

**Direct marketing**

If you have given us your consent, we will send you direct marketing messages. For instance, if you have subscribed to our Finnair newsletter or other direct marketing material, your contact details will be processed to send you the requested messages. Customers have the right to unsubscribe or opt out of receiving marketing messages at any point.

We may also send you direct marketing related to Finnair services based on applicable legislation on privacy in electronic communications, if you are an existing Finnair customer or a representative of our supplier, partner or subcontractor and have not unsubscribed (opted out) from receiving direct marketing.

**Digital touchpoints**

In addition to enabling our online services, we use cookies for collecting personal data for the purposes of providing service analytics, personalisation and advertising based on your consent. For more information on how we use cookies, please see our [cookie policy](https://www.finnair.com/en/info/finnair-cookie-policy).

**Processes including special categories of personal data**

If the processing of your health-related data is necessary, explicit consent will be requested from you. You may be asked to provide additional information, such as a doctor’s certificate to ensure you can travel according to the evaluation of a medical professional, and to ensure that we have the required information to take care of your safety and security. Once consent has been received, the data will be processed, for example, by customer care, ground handling and inflight crew, only to the extent necessary. Based on your consent, we may also process data obtained e.g. from healthcare providers, if this is necessary to verify admissibility to our flights and/or into a foreign country, during a public health crisis.

#### Based on our legal obligations

**Ensuring a safe and secure travel**

To provide you with safe and secure travel, and for complying with the safety requirements such as reporting incidents, we need to make sure we know who is on board the aircraft. We identify passengers with check-in, at the gates and in coordination with security services.

In cases where a passenger has interfered with or may compromise flight safety, security or order during or in connection with a flight, we have the right to refuse to accept the passenger on our flights due to security reasons. This decision may be made for a fixed period or until further notice. This also means that we will record the related passenger information in our security records. We will also define the length of the term during which the passenger cannot board our aircraft. We will inform the passenger about storing their information in our security records.

Local laws may require us to share your personal data with authorities, for example border control agencies, customs, immigration authorities, health authorities, police or tax authorities. In order to comply with the legal obligations, we collect and process personal data such as passport details, visa information and your address in your travel destination as required by legislation or authority requirements.

In the event of crises, Finnair may process your data for the purpose of providing care and assistance as well as in order to respond to the situation and meet our legal obligations.

**Keeping required records**

Based on accounting legislation, we are required to store our transactions and other accounting material for the time period defined by the law.

We also process the data that is provided by you in your Finnair Plus or Finnair account profile. In your profile you may choose to share your preferences and interests. These preferences may be used for pre-filling information when making a booking on the Finnair website or to provide more relevant service.

When you enrol in special events, we will process the participant list. The same applies to marketing competitions and prize draws.

**Enabling partner services** 

The Finnair Plus partners are a notable part of the Finnair Plus program, as you can earn and spend Finnair Plus points when using partner services. For this reason, Finnair sends information about partner services and benefits to members together with information regarding the Finnair Plus program and Finnair services. More information about partners is available on the Finnair website.

To provide the partner service and to keep your account balance up-to-date, Finnair also exchanges data with the Finnair Plus partners. If you use points with a partner, Finnair will be informed. Similarly, if you accrue points with one of our partners, we will be informed so you are awarded those points correctly.

In case of queries or complaints related to partner services, we might correspond with the partners and share relevant member information.

**Communication and engagement**

The data recorded is also used for targeted member communication distributed in the Finnair mobile application, the Finnair website and in our other channels.

We may use the data recorded to communicate with you about your account and program features and benefits. For instance, these messages may include but are not limited to when your points are due to expire or if you are close to the next tier.

In order to provide you with the correct information about our member offers on third-party channels, we may send a list of member emails to the respective third parties. This ensures that the right offers are displayed when you are identified as a Finnair Plus member.

#### Based on legitimate interest

**Communication and engagement**

As part of improving our customer communications, we may follow up on the frequency and engagement of how often these messages lead to further actions on your part in order to calculate the metrics such as click rates.

**Analytics** 

We may use your personal data for analytics, customer recognition and for providing personalised services and customer recognition. This enables us to provide our customers relevant services and products as well as develop our products and concept and create unique customer profiles. Profiles may be used for targeting marketing and content in our digital channels, for example the Finnair website, our mobile application or newsletters distributed by email. Direct marketing involves member-specific variation in the advertising content in the above-mentioned channels. Direction of individualised advertising at members is an integral part of the Finnair Plus program. Having a complete view of our customers enables us to understand your entire experience and helps us to improve our products and services and your experience. We may also derive other metrics based on your customer behaviour, for example, the likelihood of purchasing certain products, create customer segments, predict other products or destinations you may be interested in.

#### Based on your consent

Direct marketing messages are sent to members who have given their consent to receive such messages. These marketing materials may include offers from partners, depending on your direct marketing settings.

We may also send you direct marketing related to Finnair services based on applicable legislation on privacy in electronic communications, if you are an existing Finnair Plus customer and haven’t opted out of direct marketing.

Based on accounting legislation, we are required to store our transactions and other accounting material for the time period defined by law.
