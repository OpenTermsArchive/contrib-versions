Roblox’s mission is to connect a billion people with optimism and civility. Every day, tens of millions of people around the world have fun with friends as they explore millions of immersive digital experiences. All of these experiences are built by the Roblox community, made up of millions of creators. We believe in building a safe, civil, and diverse community—one that inspires and fosters creativity and positive relationships between people around the world.

We’ve created these Community Standards to help ensure that everyone feels safe and welcome in our shared adventure. These Standards apply to all of your actions on Roblox and with other Robloxians, both online and at real-world events hosted by Roblox. For 17+ experiences, please see [Roblox’s 17+ Policy Standards](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/15869919570708).

We ask that you respect our Standards and each other at all times — and understand that violating them may result in enforcement action against your account(s) and content. For some behavior that violates these Standards, such as behavior that poses a real-world risk to others, we reserve the right to contact or cooperate with the relevant authorities in order to keep everyone safe.

We’re always learning, so as our community evolves and our platform grows, these Standards may change too. When they do, we’ll let you know [here](https://corp.roblox.com/safety-civility-resources/). If you see something that you think violates the Community Standards, or otherwise makes you feel unsafe, please let us know by using the [Report Abuse](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/203312410) feature. For more information about the legal terms that govern your use of Roblox, head over to our [Terms of Use](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/115004647846).

We appreciate your cooperation with these Standards and commitment to keeping Roblox safe and civil.

Safety

We want our community to be a place where people can connect with optimism and civility, regardless of their identity or beliefs. To ensure Roblox is a place where everyone feels comfortable being themselves, the following is not allowed:

Child Endangerment

Roblox has a zero-tolerance policy for endangering minors, including:

* Any predatory behavior, including attempting to befriend a minor in order to manipulate and exploit them (i.e., grooming)
* Sexualizing minors in any way
* Engaging in sexual conversation with or soliciting sexual material from minors
* Sharing, requesting, or discussing child sexual exploitation material

Terrorism and Violent Extremism

Roblox has a zero tolerance policy for content or behavior that incites, condones, supports, glorifies, or promotes any terrorist or extremist organization or individual (foreign or domestic), and their ideology, or actions, including:

* Depictions of or support for terrorist or extremist attacks
* Depictions of or support for the leaders or representatives of terrorist or extremist organizations

* Recruiting membership for a terrorist or extremist organization, or encouraging others to leave Roblox to find such information
* Fundraising for terrorist or extremist organizations, people, or supporting groups

Threats, Bullying, and Harassment

Threatening others with real-world or online harm, inciting violence against people or property, bullying, stalking, trolling, harassment, intimidation, extortion, and blackmail are not permitted on Roblox. We also do not allow any content that depicts, glorifies, or promotes such behavior, including:

* Sexual harassment
* Impersonating individuals, groups, or entities, in ways that may damage their reputation or cause others to harm them, either online or in real life

Suicide, Self Injury, and Harmful Behavior

At Roblox, we take our users’ well-being very seriously. We’re here to help provide resources for those struggling with mental health, and we reserve the right to communicate with authorities regarding credible threats of self-harm. We don’t allow content or behavior that depicts, glorifies, or encourages suicide, self-injury, or real-world activities that may create an extreme risk of physical harm including:

* Describing methods for suicide or self-harm
* Content that glorifies, supports, or depicts instances or methods of suicide or self-harm
* Dangerous physical challenges or stunts in the real world

  
If you or a loved one are having thoughts of suicide or self-harm, there is help available. Reach out to a suicide prevention hotline like the one found [here](https://988lifeline.org/). For additional global resources, [here](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/11181469) is a good place to start.

Discrimination, Slurs, and Hate Speech

Roblox honors and welcomes users of all ages, backgrounds, and identities. We don't allow content or behavior that supports, glorifies, or promotes hate groups, their ideologies, or actions. You also may not discriminate, mock, or promote hatred against individuals or groups, or encourage others to do so directly or indirectly, on the basis of their:

* Age
* Race, perceived race, or ethnicity
* National origin
* Sexual orientation
* Gender, gender identity, or gender expression
* Religion or religious affiliation or beliefs
* Disability status including diseases, bodily conditions, disfigurement, mobility issues, and mental impairment
* Physical or mental disability status
* Veteran status
* Caste
* Familial status

Harmful Off-Platform Speech or Behavior

Robloxians treat everyone with respect, both on and off of Roblox. If credibly reported to us, we may take action against users who, among other things:

* Are associated with organized crime, terrorist or extremist organizations, or hate groups
* Harass, bully, discriminate, or harm others outside of Roblox
* Share others’ personal information off-platform, including making false reports to authorities
* Have been convicted of certain egregious crimes, engage in certain illegal activities, or encourage others to do so

Civility

Civility is at the core of the Roblox community. To promote our civil environment, Roblox prohibits certain types of content, including:

Real-World Sensitive Events

Roblox prohibits content that recreates specific real-world sensitive events; mocks the victims of such events; supports, glorifies, or promotes the perpetrators or outcome of such events; or capitalizes on these events for commercial purposes, including content about:

* Mass acts of violence against people or property

Violent Content and Gore

Although some experiences on Roblox may include weapons and violence, we don’t allow content that contains extreme violence or serious physical or psychological abuse, including:

* Animal abuse and torture
* Realistic or real-world depictions of extreme gore, graphic violence, or death

For 17+ experiences, please see [Roblox’s 17+ Policy Standards](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/15869919570708).

Romantic and Sexual Content

Roblox is a safe space for meeting online friends, chatting, and collaborating on creative projects, but we prohibit content that depicts sexual activity or seeks real world romantic relationships, including:

We also require that the odds of winning be fair and clearly disclosed to the user prior to playing.

If you or someone you know is struggling with substance abuse, help is available. You can start [here](https://www.samhsa.gov/public-messages).

For 17+ experiences, please see [Roblox’s 17+ Policy Standards](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/15869919570708).

Profanity

To keep Roblox safe and civil for everyone, we don’t allow swearing in any language text, images, or uploaded audio, including:

* Using misspellings, special characters, or other methods to evade detection of profanity
* Quoting or using audio containing profane lyrics

Political Content

We value friendly debate about issues and topics that matter to Robloxians. However, to maintain a civil and respectful environment, we prohibit the discussion or depiction of certain political content, including:

* Current candidates running for public office, including their slogans, campaign material, rallies, or events
* Political parties, including official party-affiliated organizations
* Specific races for elected office
* Sitting real-world elected officials

* Desecration of political entity symbols, including flag burning
* Inflammatory content related to real world border, territorial, or jurisdictional relationships

Integrity

We want Robloxians to trust each other to play fairly and honestly, and to respect one another’s creativity and hard work. To encourage this, Roblox requires its users to follow their local laws and prohibits or limits:

Cheating and Scams

We don’t permit users to deploy or discuss deceptive schemes or methods of cheating on our platform, including:

* Using exploits to gain an unfair advantage anywhere on the platform
* Sharing exploits with others or encouraging others to cheat
* Selling items with misleading or inaccurate descriptions

Spam

Roblox prohibits disrupting or misleading others on the platform. This includes:

* Deceptive, sensational, or otherwise misleading content or metadata used to inappropriately drive discoverability or engagement
* Repetitive messaging to other users or uploads to Roblox systems
* Creating experiences solely to direct users off Roblox

Intellectual Property Violations

We expect you to respect the intellectual property rights of others, and will remove infringing content upon receiving a valid copyright or trademark takedown request from a rights holder. Examples of intellectual property infringement may include:

* Using another developer’s code to create your experience without their permission
* Using another artist’s media in your experience without their permission
* Using a brand’s logo or designs for the content you create without their permission

For information on how to use Roblox’s name and logo, please see our [Community Usage Guidelines](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/115001708126).

Copyright and trademark takedown requests can be filed [here](https://www.roblox.com/support).

You can learn more about intellectual property reporting on Roblox [here](https://create.roblox.com/docs/production/publishing/dmca-guidelines).

Advertising

Independent Advertisement Publishing Instead of using Roblox Immersive Ads, developers may independently publish advertising content in their experience(s). In these cases, the developer of the experience must directly upload and control delivery of the advertising content and remains responsible for such content. When independently publishing advertisements, developers must follow the rules outlined below, as well as all Roblox rules (including the Terms of Use, [Advertising Standards](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/13722260778260), and all other Community Standards) and applicable laws and regulations. If your advertising content violates these rules, we may take action including removing the content, suspending the experience or suspending the account.

* Developers must maintain full control of independent advertisement publishing. If a developer shows independent ads in their experience, that experience may not make programmatic calls to third-party advertising services.
* Developers may not share personally identifiable user engagement information with advertisers and must comply with the [Creator Analytics Terms of Use](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/10949046065044) and [Roblox Terms of Use](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/115004647846) in their treatment of all user information.
* Developers are prohibited from showing advertising content to users under the age of 13. To accomplish this, developers must use Roblox tools such as the AreAdsAllowed boolean in [PolicyService API](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/PolicyService) to replace, hide, or block access to advertising content to any users who are disallowed from seeing ads.  
    Note: Applying a 13+ Experience Guideline does not hide ad content from users under the age of 13. All ad content must be hidden using the PolicyService API.
* Developers must clearly and prominently disclose to users when content is an advertisement using simple and understandable language. Reference to the name of an advertiser alone is insufficient. Examples of acceptable disclosure language include “ad,” “paid,” or “sponsored.” The disclosure should be in or near the advertising content and be presented in a way that is likely to be noticed and understood by users.
* Developers may not mislead users into thinking that they are engaging with Roblox served Ads.
* Developers may not reuse or repurpose Roblox Immersive Ad content.
* Advertisements cannot falsely represent the content being advertised to encourage user engagement (e.g., offer free Robux).

  
For more information on how to independently advertise, please see our [Creator guidance here.](https://create.roblox.com/docs/production/promotion/advertising-on-roblox#independent-advertising)

Prohibited Advertising Practices and Content All advertisements on Roblox must adhere to Roblox’s [Advertising Standards](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/13722260778260). Creator guidance for complying with the Advertising Standards can be found [here](https://create.roblox.com/docs/production/promotion/complying-with-advertising-standards).

Roblox Economy

Roblox maintains the Robux system for everyone’s benefit and enjoyment. To keep it fair for everyone, some activity in the Roblox Economy is prohibited, including:

* Using third-party services to buy, sell, trade, or give away Robux. This does not apply to Roblox gift cards.
* Engaging in off-platform, secondary market transactions for account access or virtual content from experiences or Marketplace. This does not apply to account holders selling or transferring the rights to the account’s creations as part of a verifiable agreement.
* Using the group payout system in a fraudulent or misleading manner; including offering payment in Robux for acting as a model for assets, joining groups, referring members, or role-playing in experiences.

Promotional Offers Developers may not use off-platform services or products to sell on-platform items (including exclusive features or other in-experience enhancements) for money or Robux, either directly or as a bundle, unless expressly authorized by or in partnership with Roblox. Find more details on acceptable promo codes [here](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/10549651908244).

Soliciting Donations We also don’t allow our community to solicit donations for a charitable cause on Roblox, including:

* In-experience prompts for users to donate Robux toward a crowdfunding campaign
* Claiming that a transaction is associated with a fundraiser
* Stating to users that some amount of sales proceeds will be directed toward a cause

  
Note: Developers may implement in-experience Robux transactions for users to express appreciation of the experience or generously reward a creator (e.g. a “tip jar” feature) as long as it is clear to the user that they receive nothing in return for their payment.

Paid Random Items Paid random item generators include those purchased with Robux directly or via in-experience currencies that are purchased with Robux.

* If paid random items are available in your experience, users may not trade or sell the resulting assets for Robux, real currency, or anything else of value on Roblox.
* Creators must use the applicable [PolicyService API](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/PolicyService/GetPolicyInfoForPlayerAsync) to ensure paid random items are only accessible by eligible users.
* The odds of receiving each possible resulting item must be accurately disclosed to the eligible user before the moment of purchase.

Security

For our community to thrive, everyone must feel digitally safe as well as physically safe. We can achieve this by respecting each other’s personal information and Roblox’s safety systems, and by keeping Roblox accounts secure. This section describes how players and creators should treat others’ information and protect their own and others’ digital security.  
  
For information about how Roblox handles your personal information, please visit the [Privacy Policy](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/115004630823). For more information on how to keep your account secure - including how to enable additional security features such as two-step verification - visit our help page [here](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/203313380).  
  
To help maintain a safe metaverse, Roblox does not permit:

Sharing Personal Information

To maintain privacy and safety, users may be prohibited from sharing their own or requesting others’ personal information and unique identifiers on Roblox, including:

* Email address
* Passwords or access tokens
* Home address or physical location
* Financial information including credit cards and bank account details
* Medical information
* Telephone number
* Internet Identifiers such as usernames and handles not linked to Roblox
* Unique Identifiers such as social security number
* Images of themselves or other non-public figures
* Real names except as permitted in display names for eligible users
* Any personal identifiable information relating to minors including unauthorized images or voice and video recordings.

Directing Users Off-Platform

When using Roblox, you may not link to any external websites or services, except for: YouTube, Facebook, Discord, Twitter, and Twitch. Links to any of those approved sites must be wrapped in the [applicable PolicyService API](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/PolicyService/GetPolicyInfoForPlayerAsync) or listed in the Social Networks and Social Links settings of your profile or experience description page. Links (including those to approved sites) that appear in locations where the API cannot be deployed - such as text chat or embedded in media - are prohibited. Any other links or efforts to evade detection of links are prohibited, including:

* Links that contain Roblox-inappropriate content
* Partial links, filter-breaking, and permitted website links to non-permitted websites
* Encouraging others to visit unpermitted external links

  
Note: For their privacy and safety, we prohibit users under age 13 from sharing links, regardless of API usage

Misusing Roblox Systems Roblox maintains many systems to keep our users safe and secure, and we prohibit attempts to bypass these systems, gain unauthorized access to Roblox or to others’ Roblox accounts or information, or to otherwise violate our platform security requirements, including by:

Evading Safety and Security Systems

* Attempting to get prohibited content around our safety systems, including by hiding violative elements of assets
* Creating or using an account to avoid enforcement action taken against another account
* Using VPNs to mask your location in order to gain unauthorized access to Roblox, including to a specific feature or account
* Offering access to your Roblox account or soliciting access to another’s Roblox account for the purpose of evading enforcement action or safety systems
* Failing to use required PolicyService APIs in your experience

Disruptive Content and Behavior

* Using bots that are programmed to run disruptive tasks
* Uploading content that contains obfuscated code or hidden scripts that mislead end users or create disruptive experiences for them
* Injecting background noise into underlying audio that makes the intended audio unintelligible
* Injecting excessive loudness, screaming, or harsh noises that disrupts others’ experience, either in uploaded audio or through chat with voice
* Falsely reporting other users or experiences or encouraging others to do so
* Invading or flooding experiences or groups in an effort to disrupt the experience or its reputation
