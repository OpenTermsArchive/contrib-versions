Roblox Community Standards
==========================

At Roblox, we’re building the metaverse: a space for people to adventure, experience, and explore. We’re a global community on this journey together, and we want to ensure everyone feels welcome and safe and is treated with kindness and respect. That’s why we’ve created these Community Standards: to outline how we expect our users to behave, and to be clear up front about what is and isn’t allowed on Roblox.

Our Community Standards are organized into four sections:

* Safety
* Civility & Respect
* Fairness & Transparency
* Security & Privacy

These standards apply to all of your actions on Roblox and with other Robloxians, both online and at real-world events hosted by Roblox. You might notice that some of these rules prohibit things that certain other online platforms allow. That’s because of our determination to keep Roblox as safe as possible. We ask that you respect our standards — and understand that violating them may result in enforcement action against your account. We’re always learning, so as our community evolves and our platform grows, these standards may change too.

In short, when using Roblox, always remember to **be kind**. If you see something that you think violates the Community Standards, please let us know by using the [Report Abuse](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203312410) feature. For more information about the legal relationship between you and Roblox, head over to our [Terms of Use](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004647846).

We appreciate your cooperation with these standards and commitment to making Roblox a safe and respectful space.

This includes any attempts to impersonate in the following areas:
    
    * Name or username
    * Position in a company
    * Digital representation

    This does not apply to satire, fan art, or tributes that are not misleading to other users.  
      
    
23. **Intellectual Property Violations**  
    We don’t allow users to violate intellectual property rights on Roblox, and will remove infringing content upon receiving a valid Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) notice or Trademark infringement removal request. Examples of intellectual property infringement may include:

    * Lottery-style games
    * Any use of the words “Play for R$” in games
    * Offers of “free Robux”
    
    If paid random items appear in your experience, they cannot be sold or traded for Robux, real currency, or anything else of value on Roblox. You also must use the applicable [Policy API](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/PolicyService/GetPolicyInfoForPlayerAsync).  
      
    
25. **Directing Users Off-Platform**  
    When using Roblox, you may not link to any external websites or services, **except for**: YouTube, Facebook, Discord, Twitter, and Twitch. Links to any of those approved sites must be wrapped in the [applicable Policy API](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/PolicyService/GetPolicyInfoForPlayerAsync) or listed in the Social Networks and Social Links settings of your profile or experience description page. Links that appear in locations where the API cannot be deployed - such as text chat - are prohibited. Any other links are prohibited, including:
    
    * Links that contain Roblox-inappropriate content
    * Partial links, filter-breaking, and permitted website links to non-permitted websites
    * Encouraging others to visit unpermitted external links

26. **Advertising**  
    You can place ads in your experience in the form of 3d assets, static images, or videos, as long as you directly upload the ad assets (‘direct upload ads’) and follow the rules outlined below. Roblox will determine, at its sole discretion, whether advertising or brand placement meets these requirements and we may reject ads whose content harms our relationship with our community or compromises our competitive interests (e.g., gaming platforms and development tools). If your ad violates these rules, we may remove the content or suspend your experience, or require you to remove the content, at any time and without notice.
    * Developers who place advertisements in their experiences remain responsible for all advertising content; ads must follow the Community Rules, the Terms of Use and all other Roblox rules.
    * You may not relinquish control of the ad serving logic in your experience, including by using third party ad servers.
    * Ads may not contain content intended for users under the age of 13.

    * Ads cannot falsely represent the content being advertised to encourage user engagement (e.g., offer free Robux).
    * Developers may only share aggregated user information with third party advertisers.  
          
        

**SECURITY AND PRIVACY**
------------------------

For our metaverse to thrive, the Roblox community must feel digitally safe as well as physically safe. We can achieve this by respecting each other’s private information and Roblox’s safety systems, and by keeping Roblox accounts and systems secure. This section describes how players and creators should treat others’ information and digital security. For information about how Roblox handles your personal information, please visit the [Privacy Policy](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/roblox.com/info/privacy).

To maintain a safe metaverse, Roblox does **not** permit:

27. **Unauthorized Access**  
    We prohibit any activity that is used to gain unauthorized access to Roblox’s systems or accounts, as well as threatening or encouraging such activity. This includes:
    * Using VPNs to mask your location in order to gain unauthorized access to the Roblox platform, a specific feature, or another user’s account
    * Attempting to hack another user’s account
    * Launching any sort of cyberattack
    * Posting misleading links for the purpose of gaining unauthorized access (i.e., phishing)
    * Launching malicious software (i.e., malware) to cause damage to or gain access to another user’s computer.

    Roblox maintains many systems to keep our users safe and secure, and we prohibit attempts to bypass these systems or otherwise violate our platform security requirements. This includes:
    * Attempting to get prohibited content approved by our moderation team
    * Opening new accounts for the purpose of evading an enforcement action taken against a previous account
    * Using bots that are programmed to run disruptive, large-scale tasks
    * Re-uploading previously-moderated content

    * Falsely reporting other users or experiences, or encouraging or others to do so
    * Invading or flooding experiences or groups in an effort to destroy the experience or its reputation  
          
        
30. **Roblox Economy**  
    Roblox maintains the Robux system for everyone’s benefit and enjoyment. To keep it secure, some uses of Robux are not permitted, including:
    
    * Using third-party services to sell, trade, or give away Robux. This does not apply to Roblox gift cards.
    * Promotional codes that falsely appear to be offered by Roblox itself
    * Inappropriate use of the group payout system, including offering payment in Robux for acting as a model for assets, joining groups, referring members, or role-playing in experiences.
    
    You also may not use third-party services or products to sell, either directly or as a bundle: in-experience items, exclusive features, or other in-experience enhancements.  
      
    We also don’t allow using Roblox to solicit donations for an external charitable cause. This includes, but is not limited to:
    * In-experience prompts for users to donate Robux toward a crowdfunding campaign
    * Claiming that a transaction is associated with a fundraiser
    * Stating to users that some amount of sales proceeds will be directed toward a causeNote: Developers are allowed to implement in-experience Robux transactions for users to express appreciation of the experience or generously reward a creator (e.g. a “tip jar” feature) as long as it is clear to the user that they receive nothing in return for their payment.
