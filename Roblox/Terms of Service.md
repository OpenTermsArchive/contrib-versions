Disputes submitted to arbitration in violation of the Informal Dispute Resolution Requirements shall not be accepted by AAA and shall be deemed frivolous for purposes of any fee shifting allowed by AAA RulesThe Consumer Arbitration Rules applied by the AAA.. Any lawsuit filed in violation of the Informal Dispute Resolution Requirements shall be subject to dismissal.
        4.  Commencement of Arbitration. Unless the parties agree otherwise, a demand for arbitration must be sent to the same address and by the same manner as an initial notice of a Dispute and must be entitled “Demand for Arbitration.”
        5.  Fees. If User has complied with the Informal Dispute Resolution Requirements, and if User’s total claims are for less than $10,000, Roblox will reimburse User the cost of User’s filing fee, unless the arbitrator determines that the substance of User’s claims or remedy sought were frivolous or brought for an improper purpose as described in the AAA RulesThe Consumer Arbitration Rules applied by the AAA.; in which case payment of any filing, administrative, or arbitrator fees will be decided by AAA RulesThe Consumer Arbitration Rules applied by the AAA.. Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the Roblox TermsCollectively, the User Terms, the Creator Terms, the DevEx Terms, the Roblox Community Standards, the DMCA Guidelines and Policies and the Roblox TM Guidelines., a prevailing party in arbitration will only be entitled to be awarded a shifting of fees and costs when consistent with AAA RulesThe Consumer Arbitration Rules applied by the AAA..
        6.  Location. Unless the parties agree otherwise, any arbitration hearing will take place in San Mateo County, California if that is a reasonably convenient location for User, and if not, then in the county or parish where User resides. Depending on the amount of a claim, AAA RulesThe Consumer Arbitration Rules applied by the AAA. may permit or require the arbitration to be conducted: (1) only by documents submitted to the arbitrator; or (2) by telephone hearing. Regardless of how arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a written decision explaining the findings and conclusions that their decision is based on.
        7.  Settlement Offers. During arbitration, if Roblox makes User (or User makes Roblox) a settlement offer, the amount of the offer may not be shared with the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award. If User wins the arbitration and is awarded more than the amount reflected in Roblox’s last written settlement offer, Roblox will pay User the higher of: (a) the arbitrator’s award or (b) $10,000.
        8.  No Consolidation. To the extent permitted by law, the arbitrator shall not consolidate claims into a class proceeding and may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual parties to the arbitration and only to the extent necessary to provide relief that is warranted by an individual claim.
        9.  Enforceability. All issues in the Dispute are for the arbitrator to decide, except that only a court may decide issues relating to the scope, interpretation, and enforceability of these Arbitration Terms, or whether a Dispute can be arbitrated. Judgment on an arbitration award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction.
        10.  Severability. Except for the Class Action Waiver, if any provision of these Arbitration Terms is found unenforceable, that provision will be severed and the balance of these Arbitration Terms will remain in full force and effect. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of these Arbitration Terms as to any particular claim for relief or remedy (such as declaratory or injunctive relief), then that claim or remedy (and only that claim or remedy) must be severed from the arbitration, while the remaining claims and remedies (such as individual damages or restitution) will still be resolved through binding arbitration.
        11.  Confidentiality. The arbitrator shall honor all evidentiary privileges recognized at law and shall enter orders as appropriate to protect the parties’ trade secrets or confidential information. The parties agree to maintain the confidentiality of each party’s designated confidential information.

        13.  Exceptions to Arbitration Terms. Individual non-class claims that User or Roblox chooses to assert in small claims court are not subject to the Arbitration Terms, but the Informal Dispute Resolution Requirements must be satisfied prior to the filing of any such small claims action. In addition, claims that are the subject of a certified class action or a class settlement submitted to a court for approval, regardless of whether the claimant has opted out of the class action or class settlement, are not subject to the Arbitration Terms and may not be the subject of an arbitration demand. Regardless of whether a User has opted out of a class action or class settlement, the certification of a class action or the filing of a proposed class settlement with a court for approval shall divest AAA of its authority to arbitrate any claims pending with AAA that are otherwise the subject of the class action or settlement. Such opt out claims may thereafter only be asserted in a court of law.
        14.  Opting Out of Arbitration Terms. User may opt out of the Arbitration Terms within 30 days of using the Services for the first time, and User may opt out of any material changes to the Arbitration Terms within 30 days after Roblox gives notice of those changes (unless a longer period is required by applicable law).

                *   The Creator receives 30% of the RobuxThe official currency of the Platform which is used by Users to acquire things, like Virtual Items and access to Experiences, on the Platform. generated from the sale.
