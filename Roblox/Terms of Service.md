    RobloxThe Roblox Corporation, including its designated subsidiaries: Roblox Prepaid Company LLC, Roblox Godo Kaisha or Roblox Japan, Roblox Canada Inc., Roblox UK Limited (FKA Ceebr Limited), Roblox India Services Private Limited, Roblox Korea Limited, Roblox Australia Pty Ltd, and Roblox Netherlands B.V. has a multilayered moderation system that is designed to assess content uploaded to RobloxThe Roblox Corporation, including its designated subsidiaries: Roblox Prepaid Company LLC, Roblox Godo Kaisha or Roblox Japan, Roblox Canada Inc., Roblox UK Limited (FKA Ceebr Limited), Roblox India Services Private Limited, Roblox Korea Limited, Roblox Australia Pty Ltd, and Roblox Netherlands B.V. for potential violations of the Community Standards:
    
    * For text, we use techniques such as text filters and keyword lists. If a user attempts to send text that would be recognized by these methods, the text is filtered, preventing other users from being exposed to the violative content.
    * For visual assets, including avatars and avatar accessories, we use computer vision. One technique involves taking photographs of 3D assets from multiple angles. The system then reviews those photographs to determine what the next step should be. If nothing seems amiss, the item is approved.
    * For voice chat, we use Automatic Speech Recognition to transcribe voice into text, then use an in-house AI model to classify and detect violating language. This is done in real-time, allowing us to take action such as temporarily suspending or banning users violating our Community Standards in voice chats on RobloxThe Roblox Corporation, including its designated subsidiaries: Roblox Prepaid Company LLC, Roblox Godo Kaisha or Roblox Japan, Roblox Canada Inc., Roblox UK Limited (FKA Ceebr Limited), Roblox India Services Private Limited, Roblox Korea Limited, Roblox Australia Pty Ltd, and Roblox Netherlands B.V..
