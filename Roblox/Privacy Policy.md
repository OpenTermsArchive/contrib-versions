1\. About Roblox and this Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to us. In order to help you understand our privacy practices, we created this Privacy Policy so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and who we share it with.

This Policy covers our websites on the roblox.com domain, our Roblox mobile, virtual reality and Xbox apps, the Roblox Player, the Roblox Studio, and our other websites, products, software, applications, content, data feeds and other services on which an authorized link to this Policy is posted. This Policy covers our practices regarding Roblox users of all ages, including a unique set of practices for those under the age of 13. The Service is operated by or on behalf of Roblox Corporation.

Roblox is also committed to protecting the privacy of our users, including children. Please see the ["Children’s Privacy and Parental Controls"](#parental-controls) section below for more information about your rights as a parent or legal guardian of our children users and the measures we take to afford children users with additional protections and comply with applicable data protection legislation, depending on where you are located, such as the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the Brazilian General Data Protection Law (“LGPD”).

To learn more about COPPA, you may consult this simple one-page informational guide from the kidSAFE Seal Program – [www.kidsafeseal.com/knowaboutcoppa.html](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/www.kidsafeseal.com/knowaboutcoppa.html).

Roblox values your trust, so we want to tell you about the personal information we collect from you when you use our websites and app, how we use it, and who we share it with. That’s why we've created this privacy policy to keep you informed.

Roblox is a global company, and this policy is for everyone around the world. Roblox has to follow laws designed to protect personal information in the different countries where our users live. For example, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) in the US, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) in the EU and the UK, and the Brazilian General Data Protection Law (“LGPD”) in Brazil apply to Roblox.

The laws in these countries give children (meaning users under the age of 13 for COPPA, for example) data protection rights. More information about these special rights are in the “Your Privacy Rights” sections below. You can also see the ["Children’s Privacy and Parental Controls"](#parental-controls) section for more information about your rights as a parent or legal guardian of our children users and the measures we take to afford children users with additional protections and comply with applicable data protection legislation, depending on where you are located.

You can learn more about COPPA, by looking at this simple guide from the kidSAFE Seal Program – www.kidsafeseal.com/knowaboutcoppa.html.

If you or your parent or guardian have questions about this policy or how we use your personal information, you can contact us by completing this [Customer Support Form](https://www.roblox.com/support).

Alternatively, you can email our GDPR representative if you are in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland or by telephoning or writing to the Roblox office in California or our office for the EEA or the UK.

2\. Definitions

For the purposes of our services, the definitions are as follows:

“Children” or “Child” means any user under the age of 13.

“Personal Information” means any information relating to a natural person who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, or an online identifier.

“Platform” means our Roblox platform, the ultimate virtual universe where imagination rules.

“Privacy Policy” or “Policy” means this Roblox Privacy Policy.

“Processing” means any operation which is performed on Personal Information, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or any kind of disclosure or other use.

“Service” means any service or application offered by Roblox, such as allowing users to develop Platform experiences, connect with others, and use content created by you and other users.

Any other capitalized term that is not defined in this Policy is defined and has the meaning set out in our Terms of Use.

3\. Information Collected on our Corporate Websites

Please note that our corporate websites (which may include corp.roblox.com, blog.roblox.com, and their subdomains) are general audience websites. On these sites, we may provide information regarding the corporate side of Roblox, press information, career information, and other general audience information. We may also ask for your name, email address, employment details if you send us a CV, resume or other details of your employment history in connection with an advertised job vacancy or a general inquiry regarding employment opportunities with us and other information so that we can provide corporate-related information to you or respond to your job application. No experiences are available on the corporate websites. As such, the parts of this Privacy Policy that discuss experiences or discuss children are not applicable to the corporate websites.

We have a number of corporate websites, such as corp.roblox.com and blog.roblox.com. These sites explain our technology and who works at Roblox. There is news on there about the company and we let people know about job openings that they can apply for at Roblox. There is also information on there for parents in the resources section. While these websites are generally aimed at adults, you can also visit them to learn more about Roblox as a company.

We only collect information from people on these websites when someone is applying for a job.

4\. Information You Provide when Setting Up an Account on Roblox

All users must create a Roblox account to join any experiences. To create a Roblox account, we will ask you to create a unique username and password (so you can log into your account) and to provide other demographic information, such as your age or date of birth, gender, regional location or language preference (so we can customize your experience on Roblox).

Users are strongly encouraged not to create a username that reflects their own name or other Personal Information. Users should also not pick a password that is easy to guess, and should not share their password.

Usernames are used for participating in Service features, and we do not use them to identify individual users outside of their activities on our Service. Usernames are shared with the parties listed in Section 7 below.

Users may be asked to provide or may choose to add an email address to their account for added verification and/or to enable certain features. The primary purpose for this email address is to provide account security, since this is the only way for Roblox to check the authenticity of an account owner. In this circumstance, children are asked to provide a parent email address. Users may change the email address associated with their account at any time; however, a notification will be sent to the previously provided email address upon making that change.

Everyone on Roblox has to create an account in order to participate in our experiences.

When you create a Roblox account, we will ask you to choose a unique username and password (so that you can log into your account).

We will also ask you for your date of birth, your gender, the country you live in and which language you speak.

You must not create a username that includes your real name. It is also important to create a password that is not easy to guess. You may share your password with your parent(s) or legal guardian, but never share it with anyone else, not even your friends.

You can also add an email address to your account in case you cannot remember your password and need to reset it.

5\. Additional Personal Information We Collect When You Use Roblox Features

In addition to account setup on Roblox, we may collect and process Personal Information from you directly if you use the following features and activities (as applicable):

*   When you make purchases on the Service. Users can purchase virtual currency or premium subscriptions, for example, in the form of Robux, Premium memberships, etc., and may use a variety of payment methods. When making purchases, users or their parents will be required to enter billing information, which may include name, billing address, credit card or other payment information, and billing email. Our payment processors will process all purchases, and you will be subject to their terms and conditions and privacy policy. Your billing information, transaction details, and purchase history may be retained and used by our payment processors to resolve subsequent billing disputes and inquiries.
*   When you post, share, or otherwise transmit comments, messages, or content on Roblox via community features, such as public chat or private chat, forums, group walls, personal posts, portfolios, etc. We may collect these comments, messages, posts, and they may be monitored, filtered and moderated for purposes such as removal of profanity, Personal Information, and other inappropriate content. Where permitted by law, we may use pre-filtered chat, comments and messages for purposes such as training and improving our filter technology to increase the safety on our platform.
*   When you participate in our Roblox Developer Exchange Program. We require you to provide us with an IRS W-9 form (for U.S. taxpayers) or W-8 form (for non-U.S. taxpayers). We may also ask you to verify your identity by providing a government issued photo ID through a third-party vendor. For more information on the Developer Exchange program, please visit our [Developer Exchange Terms of Use](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005718246).
*   When you provide us with your phone number. If you choose to provide a phone number during registration, you may receive a verification SMS after sign-up to confirm your ownership of the number, which will allow you to log in via mobile. Your phone number may also be used to recover a lost or forgotten password.
*   When you join our experiences on a VR platform. If you join our experiences on a VR platform, we will collect your physical movement information in order to replicate your movement in the experience. This information is only used to provide the Service and is not stored.
*   When you contact or send communications to us. For example, when you contact customer support, report a problem, or submit questions, concerns, or comments regarding our Service or its content, we may collect contact information such as your email address and other important information about your inquiry or concern. This information is used to respond to your communications, fulfill your requests, or provide other customer support.
*   When you use or interact with third-party plug-ins that may be available on the Service for users other than children. This includes third-party social media widgets, share buttons, and/or login mechanisms. These features may include social plugins from Google, Facebook, Twitter or other platforms, and may be subject to the terms and conditions and/or privacy policies of these other companies as posted on their respective websites. When you use these features, certain information from your social media accounts may be accessed by or shared with Roblox, and likewise, certain information about your use of Roblox may be posted to your profile on those platforms.
*   When you participate in contests, competitions, sweepstakes, giveaways, prize draws or other promotions that we may run or sponsor on our Service. These promotions may involve the collection and use of certain contact information (such as your name, email address, and/or phone number) for prize fulfillment purposes, as well as other information or content needed for the specific promotion. In some jurisdictions, we are required to publicly share information about the winners.
*   When you respond to or participate in voluntary research or demographic surveys or studies. These surveys may collect information about your likes and dislikes, experience interests and habits, general hobbies and interests, and other lifestyle information or preferences. These surveys may ask for Personal Information.
*   When you request or agree to voice based services from Roblox. With your consent, we may collect, process and store your voice recording to provide services and to increase the safety of our voice related services. We may use your voice recording for purposes such as training and improving our filter technology to increase the safety on our platform, except that we will not engage in these activities with private server voice chat recordings of EEA users.
*   When you request or agree to location-based services from Roblox, which may be available to our users other than children. With your consent, we may collect or track real-time or precise geolocation information to provide services such as tagging, check-in and content delivery, or geo-based advertising, or other services that are dependent on knowing where you are. This information may be collected in combination with an identifier associated with your device to enable us to recognize your mobile browser or device when you return to the Service. You can always stop the collection of location information by updating your device settings, stopping the use of the Service, or uninstalling our mobile applications.
*   When you subscribe to other features or activities, which may be available to our users other than children. We may offer other features or activities on our Services from time to time, and you may be able to submit or upload Personal Information in connection with such features. The data being collected for such features and their intended uses will be evident at the time of data collection.
*   When you browse, navigate, or otherwise interact with the Service. We collect information about your interactions with the Service and connect the information collected with your account to provide you a better user experience. For example, we may collect information from your search history to provide you with similar recommendations. We may also collect information from your device when you visit our websites, as outlined in the “[Cookies and Similar Technologies](#cookies)” section below.
*   Information processed to enable advertising. To market our services, inter alia, via social media platforms in order to bring new users to our websites and to maintain and increase our user base, we may process Personal Information such as IP addresses, information on users’ browsers or operating systems, including language settings, location information and user names or user IDs.

You are under no obligation to provide Personal Information to Roblox when requested. However, if you choose to withhold any requested information, we may not be able to provide you with certain services and features.

In addition to the specific uses above, any information that you provide or that we collect on the Service may be generally used for the following purposes:

*   To operate, maintain, and improve the Service;
*   To give you access to the Service and related features, or restrict your access;

*   To provide technical support or customer service;
*   To deliver advertising for our Services that may be relevant to your interests;
*   To detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent or illegal activity, and prosecute those responsible for that activity;

*   To audit interactions, transactions, and other compliance activities; and
*   To protect the integrity, safety, or security of the Service or our users, comply with legal obligations, or enforce compliance with our Terms of Use, or other restrictions placed on your use of the Service.

You don't have to share any additional personal information with us (other than the information described above) to use our websites or app. We may collect other personal information when you use our platform, for example, if you or your parents buy Robux, we will collect additional information from the buyer in order to take the payment such as your name, billing address, email address and payment card details or other payment information.

When you type content on Roblox in public chat, private chat, forums, group walls, personal posts or portfolios, we will monitor what you write to check that they do not contain swear words, your personal information or chat that is not suitable for users to have on Roblox.

If you contact us, for example, about a problem with our services, we may collect your contact information, such as your email address and other important information about your issue or concern. We will only use this information to solve your problem/concerns and to be able to reply to you.

When you browse and use our websites and app we might collect information about your actions on the website and app to make your experience better. For example, we might look at your search history and suggest other games that are similar.

We might also collect information from your device when you visit our websites, as outlined in the “[Cookies and Similar Technologies](#cookies)” section.

If you or your parent(s) want more information about the additional personal information we may collect, it can be found in the detailed section of our full privacy policy.

Any information that you give to us or that we collect might be used to:

*   keep the website and/or app running and to improve it;

6\. Cookies and Similar Technologies

Like most websites, we use cookies and other standard internet technologies to help us improve our Service.

#### Cookies

A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, for example so you don’t have to re-enter them whenever you come back to the website or browse from one page to another.

A cookie can be classified by its lifespan and the domain to which it belongs. By lifespan, a cookie is either a:

*   Session cookie which is erased when the user closes the browser; or
*   Persistent cookie which remains on the user’s computer/device for a pre-defined period of time.

As for the domain to which it belongs, there are either:

*   First-party cookies which are set by the web server of the visited page and share the same domain (in this case roblox.com domain); or
*   Third-party cookies stored by a different domain to the visited page’s domain. This can happen when the webpage references a file, such as JavaScript, located outside its domain

  

#### Pixel Tags/Web Beacons

A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded in the Services that collects information about visitors’ engagement on that web page. The use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, that a visitor has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement.

#### How we use cookies

When you visit or access the Service, we may – by means of cookies, beacons, tags, scripts, and/or other similar technologies – automatically collect technical information about the devices and software you use to access the Service, such as the type of Internet browser or mobile device you use, the website or source that linked or referred you to the Service, your IP address or device ID (or other persistent identifier that uniquely identifies your computer or mobile device on the Internet), the operating system of your computer or mobile device, and other similar technical information. These same technologies (or a combination of them) may also be used to help us:

*   Capture and store users’ preferences, account settings, and certain login information (for convenience, user verification, and account security);
*   Compile statistics and analytics about your use of and interaction with the Service, including details about how and where our Service is downloaded from or accessed, how often a user visits or uses the Service, the date and time of user visits to, and actions on, the Service, which areas of the Service are visited and for how long, information regarding in-game activities, and other similar traffic, usage, and trend data;
*   Mobile analytic tools to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your device and gain insights about how mobile software is used;
*   Gather important functionality, testing, and performance data about our Service, including performance data related to our mobile application, the Roblox Player, and Roblox Studio, such as networking activity, CPU load, and resource usage, among other relevant data;
*   Moderate user behavior on the Service, such as protecting against payment fraud and other inappropriate activities;
*   Gather demographic information about our user base; and;
*   Perform other similar functions.

We will not use cookies or similar technologies other than for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy.

#### Third party advertising and ad networks

Roblox partners with third-party advertisers, ad server companies, and ad networks (“third-party advertising companies”) to promote our Service. If you respond to one of our advertisements and visit or register to use our Service, we or our service providers may provide these third-party advertising companies with identifiers from your device or computer, such as an IP address or device ID, to help us analyze our user acquisition efforts.

For our users that are children, Roblox partners with third-party advertising companies to serve contextual advertising, cap the frequency of advertising, and provide related uses permitted by COPPA. Roblox does not show behaviorally targeted or retargeted ads to children or track such users for the purposes of directing targeted advertising.

NOTE: In order to disable advertising-related tracking at your request, companies may need to set an opt-out cookie on your browser. Sometimes a browser’s configuration may prevent companies from setting such cookies, for example, if your browser is set to block all third-party cookies by default. Therefore, you may need to change your browser settings to accept cookies, in order to fully disable advertising-related tracking.

7\. Information Sharing

Please note that Roblox has not and does not sell Personal Information about you to third-party companies for their independent purposes. Roblox may disclose your information for a business purpose as set forth below.

#### Service Providers

Roblox may share users’ information, including Personal Information which includes but is not limited to billing information or usernames, with our third-party agents, contractors, or service providers who are hired to perform services on Roblox’s behalf. These providers may operate or support certain functions of the Service. Below is an illustrative list of functions for which we may use third-party service providers, and the names of the providers we may use to perform these functions:

1.  Account Integrity and Security (e.g., Veriff, Arkose Labs);
2.  Analytics services (e.g., Google LLC);
3.  User Acquisition services (e.g., AppsFlyer);
4.  Community filtering and moderation services (e.g., CommunitySift);
5.  Customer support services (e.g., Zendesk);
6.  Surveys and promotions (e.g., Reach3);
7.  Social Media Log-in (e.g., SAP Customer Data Cloud);
8.  Billing services and payment gateway providers (e.g., Kount, Worldpay, PayPal, Incomm, Blackhawk, Google, Apple, Amazon, Windows Store, Xbox, Xsolla); and
9.  Hosting and content delivery network services (e.g., AWS, Equinix, CenturyLink, YouTube, Vimeo).

These third party service providers are only allowed to use the Personal Information shared with them for the specific tasks they’ve been hired to do and consistent with this Privacy Policy, and for no other purposes. They are not permitted to sell the Personal Information shared with them. Roblox takes steps to ensure that all service providers with access to Personal Information are capable of protecting the information we share with them.

#### Public forums and community areas

We offer users the ability to use forums and similar means of public discussion. If you use any messaging, posting, or chat functions on Roblox, you should be aware that any Personal Information submitted there will be available to anyone who has access to that content, including other users. This information can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and it could be used to send unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for how other individuals use the information posted in this manner.

#### Creators

The creators of the experiences you access will be provided your username, display name, user ID, and the regional location you are based in. The information shall enable the creators to determine their player base, so they can adjust their experiences to the legal requirements of the respective regional location. We offer creators a tool which allows them to review the regional location of origin of players who play their experiences. For this purpose, we will determine the user’s regional location of access to the Roblox website based on the IP address. We will not share your IP address with the creators.

#### Legal disclosures

We may disclose Personal Information about you as required or permitted by law and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Service. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we also may disclose Personal Information about you in response to a request from law enforcement agencies, regulators, or other public agencies (including schools or children services), or if we believe in good faith that such disclosure may prevent a crime, facilitate an investigation related to public safety or protect the safety of a child using our Service, protect the security or integrity of our Service, or enable us to take precautions against liability or to protect our rights.

#### Business transfers

Information about our users, including Personal Information, may be disclosed and otherwise transferred to an acquirer, successor, or assignee as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of assets, or similar transaction, or in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets. Where required by applicable law, you will be informed of such disclosure and your consent obtained.

#### De-identified information

We share aggregated, automatically-collected, or otherwise de-identified information with third parties for various purposes, including (i) compliance with reporting obligations; (ii) for business or marketing purposes; (iii) to assist us and other parties in understanding our users' interests, habits and usage patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions and/or functionality available through the Services.

#### Do Not Track

Roblox does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals.

Roblox doesn’t sell your information to other companies for them to use as they want.

Roblox does have relationships with some companies that help us provide our services (for example, when you or your parent purchase Robux), so we may provide some of your information to them, but only because we need to in order to complete your transaction.

We also hire other people and companies to perform services for us. A list of some of the companies we may use to perform these functions can be found in the detailed version of our privacy policy.The other companies are only allowed to use the personal information we share with them to complete tasks that we hire them to do. They are not allowed to sell your personal information or use it for their own purposes.

#### Public forums and community areas

There are some areas on Roblox such as in game chat where you can communicate with other Roblox users. These are public places and anything you share in these areas is available to other Roblox users who can access the same places. You should remember this before you post any information in these public areas. As you know, Roblox wants to create a safe space for all its users, so we do not allow you to share any personal information about yourself such as your name, where you live, or your email address.

#### Creators

We share your username, display name, location and user ID with the creators of the experiences you access.

#### Legal disclosures, business transfers, and other important content

If you or your parents or guardians want details about our legal disclosures, business transfers and other important content, they can view our full privacy policy.

8\. Security and Data Retention

#### Security

The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We have security measures in place to attempt to protect the personal or other sensitive information submitted to us against the loss, misuse and alteration of Personal Information under our control. While we cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of information will never occur, we use reasonable efforts to prevent it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we do not accept liability for unintentional disclosure.

When using the Services or providing Personal Information to us, we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Services. If we learn of an incident that may qualify as a breach under applicable law, we will notify you consistent with applicable laws.

#### Retention

Roblox may retain users’ account data internally for the following purposes:

*   Billing information and transaction histories are retained to resolve subsequent billing disputes and inquiries;
*   Publicly shared content and virtual items are retained for use by the community (e.g., a user-created virtual shirt sold to another user is kept in the system because the recipient now “owns” a copy of that item);
*   User account history is retained to support subsequent customer service inquiries and to provide, improve and develop the Service;
*   To promote safety and security on the Service; and
*   To resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements, and comply with our legal obligations.

We may retain your information for as long as is necessary for the purposes identified above, which may include retaining your information beyond the end of your use of the Service.

The security of your information is important to us. We have measures in place to protect it against loss, misuse, or tampering. However, no security measures are 100% effective, so we cannot guarantee against these risks.

#### How long do we keep your information for?

We will only keep your information for as long as we need to.

For more information, please review the detailed version of our full privacy policy.

9\. External Links

Our Service may, from time to time, contain links to external sites or applications. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of such sites or applications. To make clear when you are linking to a third-party site or application, we may display a warning message informing you when you are leaving our Service.

Sometimes you may find a link to another company’s website on our website or app. We aren’t responsible for that company’s privacy policies or content. If you are being directed to another site, we may display a warning message to give you a heads up.

10\. Children’s Privacy and Parental Controls

Children are entitled to added protections with regard to their Personal Information and privacy online. For this reason, when children register for the Service, their account is automatically set to a more restrictive mode This means that child users will not have access to certain features, such as social media plug-ins, some forms of third-party advertising, and certain types of notification alerts.

When a child creates an account on Roblox, we may collect a username, password, birthdate, and parent’s email address. This information is used to give the child access to the Service (with certain default settings) and, if a parent’s email is provided, to communicate with the parent about the child’s account. For example, we may use the parent’s email to send an email notification about the child’s account creation and an invitation for the parent to review, update settings, and approve of their child’s account. We may use the birthdate the child provides when signing up for the Service to determine which features on Roblox the child should have access to, and to determine when the child will be given broader access to features on our Service. In general, we will not use or share account information (including Personal Information) from your child’s account, except as permitted under the applicable laws.

We may share aggregated or otherwise de-identified information of a child (which is information that cannot be used to identify such child) with third parties for various purposes such as: (i) compliance with reporting obligations; (ii) business or marketing purposes; or (iii) to assist us and other parties in understanding our users' interests, habits and usage patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions and/or functionality available through the Services.

To make any requests for changes to your child’s account or requests for the removal of Personal Information collected about you or your child from our Service (as applicable), or to request that we stop the further collection or use of your or your child’s Personal Information in connection with the Service (as applicable), please complete the [Customer Support Form](https://www.roblox.com/support).

We offer all accounts, including children’s accounts, the ability to modify chat/communication settings (for example, limiting interaction to just friends or no one), as well as a special “Restricted Account Mode” which turns off all forms of chat and public commenting and which allows the user to access only a selection of filtered experiences on Roblox. We recommend that parents familiarize themselves with all of the safety features and parental controls available in the Settings area of the Service (a description of which can be found here) and to accompany their children when they are playing online.

We proactively filter all public and comment areas of the Service (such as chat, forums, group walls, personal posts, etc.) to remove references to addresses, emails, phone numbers, or other Personal Information regardless of security and privacy settings. All text is also filtered for profanity, phishing, and adult or suggestive content. Our system uses a combination of human and automated processes. However, like all filtering technology, our systems are not 100% effective.

If you are a child, it is a good idea to talk to and ask your parent(s) or guardian(s) for permission before using or playing on the Service. If you do not get such permission, you should not use our Service.

If we become aware that a child has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete any Personal Information we have collected, unless we have a legal obligation to keep it, and terminate the child’s account and/or revert them to the underage experience, as applicable.

As a user you are entitled to additional protections for your information and privacy online. When you register an account with Roblox, we make sure your account is set to a restrictive mode, which means that you won’t have access to certain features, such as social media links, if you are not 13 or over and your text filtering will be restricted. These additional measures are in place to keep you as safe as possible online.

If your parent or guardian's email address is provided to us when you create an account on Roblox, we may share information about your account with them by email. We can also invite your parent or guardian to review or update settings and approve your account.

If you or your parents or guardian would like more information about the restrictive account mode, or parental controls available to them, please review our full privacy policy.

If you are a parent and need to make changes to your child’s account, you can contact us by completing this [Customer Support Form](https://www.roblox.com/support).

11\. Accessing and Updating Your Personal Information

If Personal Information about you changes, or if you no longer desire to use our Service, you may correct, update, amend, or deactivate your account under your account settings or by contacting Roblox using the Personal Information set out above in Sec. 1. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe. For children under the age of 13, please see the [“Children’s Privacy and Parental Controls”](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/parental-controls) section above.
