1. Welcome to the Roblox Privacy Policy
    
    Is this Privacy Policy for you?
    
    If you make or play games in Roblox experiences, this Privacy Policy is for you, whatever your age and wherever you live. It’s also for parents or guardians of users under 13 years old. This Policy covers the Roblox [Services](#service).
    
    What is in this Privacy Policy?
    
    This policy describes the rights you have regarding your Personal Information. It explains that you can control what happens to the information that can identify you - like your name, where you live and your email address. In this Privacy Policy, we’ll also tell you when and how we use your information about you – including how we collect, record, organize, store and share it.  
    Depending on where you live, you may have different rights or choices for managing your Personal Information, which this Policy will describe later on. In the event of a conflict between the information in Sections 1-5 of this Policy and the location-specific information in Section 8, the information in Section 8 shall prevail.

    Any other capitalized term that is not defined in this Policy is defined and has the meaning set out the [Roblox Dictionary](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/4415545981332). In the event of a material or perceived conflict between the English version of this Policy and translations into other languages, the English version shall control.
    
2. Are you Under 13 or responsible for an under-13-year-old?
    
    If you’re under 13 years old, your access to certain features will be restricted in the interest of protecting your Personal Information. Roblox is especially committed to protecting the privacy of children. This part of the privacy policy is just for you.  
    
    First, get the go-ahead
    
    If you’re under 13 years old, please get permission from your parent or guardian to use Roblox. You shouldn’t use our Services without their go-ahead.
    
    Set limits
    
    No matter how old you are, Roblox communication settings allow you to control who can interact with you, for example, by only allowing interactions with friends or not allowing any interactions at all. You can also restrict your account, which turns off chat and public commenting and limits an account to certain filtered experiences on Roblox.
    
    Parents and guardians – we recommend you supervise your child whenever they’re interacting on Roblox. We’ve got some tools to help – you can learn about Roblox’s safety features [here](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/203313120).
    
    Age-appropriate privacy settings
    
    If you’re under 13 years old, we’ll automatically set your account to have strong privacy settings. While in this privacy mode, some features like social media plug-ins and certain advertising and alerts are disabled. When you turn 13, you will be able to enable additional features that are more appropriate for users ages 13 and up.
    
    Information we collect if you’re under 13 years old
    
    If you’re under 13 years old and create an account, we ask for some information (which is non-personal information, [as defined by COPPA](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-16/chapter-I/subchapter-C/part-312#p-312.2(Personal%20information))) to let you use Roblox.  
    
    We’ll collect:
    
    * your username (required). We need this to create your account and run the Roblox Service. We don’t use your username to identify you outside of Roblox
    * your password (required). We need this to log you in to your account and to run the Roblox Service
    * your date of birth (required). We’ll use this information to make sure your account has certain default settings intended for your age
    * your gender (optional). We will use this information to customize your experience
    
    For additional account security and parental controls, you have the option to provide a parent’s or guardian’s email address in account settings or during logout. Children are encouraged to provide a parent’s email address, but are not required to do so to create an account. Parent email addresses (which is the only personal information [as defined by COPPA](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-16/chapter-I/subchapter-C/part-312#p-312.2(Personal%20information)) we collect from child accounts) are collected for the security and integrity of your account and the Roblox platform. We may use your parent’s email address to communicate with them about your account, like asking them to review your account.
    
    We don’t want more Personal Information
    
    If you’re under 13 years old, we will only ask you to tell us the information we need to set up or protect your account. If you give us more of your Personal Information, we will:  
    
    * delete any additional Personal Information we’ve collected from you (unless the law requires us to keep it),
    * cancel your account, or
    * turn on age-appropriate protections on your account
    
    When users publish anything in our public and comment areas (for example, chat, forums, group walls, personal posts), we filter it and remove:
    
    * Personal Information like addresses, emails, phone numbers
    * attempts at phishing (this is when someone tries to trick you into giving out Personal Information)
    * offensive words, adult or suggestive content
    
    To provide the filtering above, we use human and automated checking to the best of our ability based on available technology – but like all filtering technology, these systems aren’t 100% effective.
    
    Please ask us if you want to make privacy-related changes
    
    You can request that Roblox make changes to your child’s account or allow you to review, delete, or prevent the further collection or use of Personal Information from you or your child. To make a request, please fill out our [Customer Support Form](https://www.roblox.com/support).  
    
    In the US and want to know more?  
    We comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). To learn more about COPPA, you can visit the US Federal Trade Commission’s COPPA website: [https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/topics/protecting-consumer-privacy-security/kids-privacy-coppa](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/topics/protecting-consumer-privacy-security/kids-privacy-coppa)
    
    You can also learn more about COPPA by looking at this simple guide from the kidSAFE Seal Program – [www.kidsafeseal.com/knowaboutcoppa.html](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/www.kidsafeseal.com/knowaboutcoppa.html)
    
3. When we collect your information
    
    Setting up a Roblox account
    
    Your first step to joining a Roblox experience is to set up a Roblox account. We’ll ask you to create a unique username and password so you can log into your account and access features on Roblox. We also ask you for your birthday and gender (gender is optional) so we can customize your experience on Roblox. Eligible users may set their account's display name to contain certain Personal Information.  
    
    Three key rules for signing up:
    
    1. Do not use your own name or other Personal Information in your username.
    2. Do not pick a password that’s easy to guess.
    3. You may share your password with your parent or guardian, but do not share it with others.
    
    We don’t use your username to identify you outside of your activity on Roblox.
    
    Why we ask you for an email address:
    
    Once you have an account, you can add your email address (or your parents’ or guardians’ email address if you are under 13) in case you need to reset your password.
    
    We might ask for your email to verify your identity or enable additional features. The main reason we need an email address is for security because it is how we check to make sure accounts are authentic. You can change your email address anytime you want – if an email address is changed, we’ll send a notification email to the address that you used before.
    
    Sharing your phone number
    
    If you choose to give a phone number, we’ll send you a text message asking you to confirm your number before you can log in. We will use your phone number for security and account access, including to recover a lost or forgotten password or log in via mobile. You authorize your wireless carrier to use or disclose information about your account and your wireless device, if available, to Roblox or its service provider for the duration of your business relationship, solely to help them identify you or your wireless device and to prevent fraud.
    
    Additionally, with your explicit and informed consent, we may use your phone number to recommend you as a friend to others using Roblox. You will be recommended with your contact name as stored on your friends’ devices, which may also include your real name. If you do not want us to use your phone number to be found by your friends on Roblox, please do not activate this feature or deactivate it at any time. Please note that the Discoverability feature may not be available in certain locations.
    
    We do not ask for your phone number if you are under 13.
    
    Purchases on Roblox
    
    You can buy virtual currency (Robux) or premium subscriptions and choose how to pay from our available payment methods. When you pay, you (or your parent or guardian if you’re under 13) will have to give billing information, including Personal Information such as:
    
    * Name of the person responsible for buying virtual currency
    * Their billing address and email
    * credit card or other payment information
    
    Our payment processors (for example, PayPal) manage the transactions, which are subject to their terms and conditions and privacy policies. Their policies will explain what Personal Information they keep and use. For example, they might keep and use your billing information, transaction details, and purchase history so that they can sort out any billing problems or inquiries.
    
    You can choose to save your billing information with one of our payment processors to make future purchases easier, in that case, Roblox does not store or have access to your full saved billing information.
    
    Posting content
    
    You can post comments, messages, or other content on Roblox through chats, forums, group walls, personal posts, or other features. Users who are age 13 or older can also use voice chat on Roblox. We monitor what you say and write to check that it meets our Community Standards and complies with our Terms of Use. If we find that the content doesn’t meet our standards, for example, if we believe that it is inappropriate, includes Personal Information, or is not suitable for users to have on Roblox, we have the right to change or remove it. Where the law allows us to, we may use the content you and other users have posted for training or to help us to improve the way we filter content on our platform. Our aim is to increase safety on our platform. We also may use this data to help us provide a better experience on Roblox and to respond to requests about your account from you or your parent or legal guardian.
    
    Asking questions or getting technical support
    
    We collect your email address (or your parents’ or guardians’ email address if you are under 13), username, and any other details you give when you:
    
    * contact customer support
    * report a problem
    * ask for technical support
    * ask us questions or give us comments
    
    We use this information to answer your questions and to give you the support or help you ask for. For users under 13, we communicate with your parent or guardian when sending our responses. We retain records of technical support questions for a limited time for internal use only, such as to answer additional questions about your account.
    
    Using Roblox features
    
    We may use Personal Information when you use certain Roblox features. To provide access to certain features, we may use your email address and other information you provide to us, such as your verified date of birth.
    
    Third-party features such as social media add-ons (users 13 and older)
    
    You can use third-party features like social media widgets, share buttons, and login features. These features may include social plugins from Google, Facebook, Twitter, or other platforms. In these cases, the third party’s terms, conditions and privacy policies apply.
    
    When you use these features:
    
    * we may be able to access or use information on your social media accounts
    * information about how you use Roblox may be shared posted on your profile on those platforms
    
    If you use your Roblox ID to sign in to a non-Roblox website or service, and later delete your Roblox account, you may lose access to that website or service.
    
    Voice-based services (users 13 and older)
    
    If you use Roblox’s voice services, we will collect, use, and store your voice recordings to:
    
    * enable voice services
    * make our voice-related services safer
    
    If you use voice services on Roblox, we may use voice recordings to inform training and product improvement in accordance with applicable law. For more information about laws that apply in your region, please visit Section 7 of this policy.
    
    We will not use your voice recording with private server voice-chat recordings of EEA and Brazilian users for training or product improvement.
    
    Location-based Services (users 13 and older)
    
    You can choose to use location-based Services if you’re 13 or older. If you agree, we may collect and track geolocation information so that we can offer Services that depend on us knowing where you are. We collect location at the country or region level; we do not collect precise geolocation data. Examples are check-in, or personalizing content or advertising.
    
    We collect this information by using an identifier on your device or browser so that we can recognize you each time you return. To stop us collecting your location information, you can update your device settings, stop using the Service, or uninstall our mobile apps.
    
    Joining on a VR platform
    
    If you join our experiences on a VR platform, we collect your physical movement information so that we can use it in the experience. This information is only used to provide the experience.We do not store this information.
    
    Camera-enabled features and uploads (users 13 and older)
    
    If you use Roblox features that require the use of your camera or upload content that contains your Personal Information, we will collect, process, and store that content only for as long as needed to accomplish the purpose of the feature. Video used to generate animation key frames is processed on your device and is not shared with Roblox or any third parties. For more information, please refer to the [Roblox Facial Animation Privacy Policy](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/8064749848980).
    
    Contact Importer (users 13 and older)
    
    If you opt-in to the Contact Importer feature, you will share the first and last names and phone numbers of your contacts in your address book on your mobile phone with Roblox. This feature helps connect with your friends on our Service. If you use the feature, we will automatically access and collect information in your address book from time to time in order to sync your contacts. Such information will only be retained in case of matches with existing Roblox users. Our Contact Importer feature is only available if you are 13 or older and may not be available in certain locations.
    
    Creator Events (users 13 and older)
    
    If you join a virtual event hosted by a Creator, data such as your username, email, and Roblox user ID may be shared with the company that hosts the events. This is done to allow you to log in to the experience. Your activity during a Creator Event is subject to the third party platform’s privacy policy as well as the Roblox Community Standards. Creator events are only available if you are 13 or older. 
    
    Interacting with our experiences
    
    To improve your experience and ensure safety, we collect information about how you interact with the Services and we connect this information with your account. For example, we may:
    
    * collect information from your game state to detect violations of our Terms and to improve our ability to detect such violations.
    * collect information about the games you are playing to give you similar recommendations.
    * share information like your username and transaction details to the UGC creator or subsequent owners, if you acquire a limited item if you purchase, share, trade, or otherwise engage in a transaction involving UGC,

    If you take part in competitions or promotions, for example, contests, sweepstakes, giveaways or prize draws, those activities may require contact information such as your name, email, or phone number, to be eligible for discounts or prizes. If you receive a gift card provided by a third party provider, certain contact information may be shared with the provider and used in accordance with this Policy and the terms listed on the provider’s website. In some places in the world, the law requires us to publicly share information about the winners.

    Information collected through cookies
    
    Like most websites, we use cookies and other standard internet technologies to help us make our services better.
    
    _Cookies_
    
    A cookie is a text file that’s put on your computer or device when you visit a website. It lets the website remember what you do and any settings you choose (e.g., login information, language, font size). Cookies make your experience more convenient – for example, if the cookie remembers your log-in details, you won’t have to enter them again each time you visit the site. Some cookies last longer than others:
    
    * Session cookies are deleted each time you close the browser
    * Persistent cookies stay on the device for a defined period of time.
    
    A cookie set by the owner of the web server you are visiting is called a first-party cookie and cookies set by owners of other domains are called third-party cookies.
    
    _Pixel Tags/Web Beacons_
    
    A pixel tag or web beacon is a piece of code that tells its owner what you do on a web page. Pixel tags provide information like which web pages you visited or which ads you clicked on.
    
    How we use cookies
    
    We use technology like cookies to recognize you and customize your experience. We and any third-parties might use these technologies whenever you visit our sites or use our Services.
    
    We collect information about the devices and software you use, for example:
    
    * the type of browser or device
    * the website or source that linked or referred you to our services

    Third-party advertising companies
    
    We partner with third-party advertising companies such as ad server companies and ad networks.

We collect this information to help us to promote and market our Services better.
    
    For users under 13 years old, Roblox partners with third-party advertising companies:
    
    * to display contextual advertising that is based on the content of the game you play
    * to limit how much advertising is shown to you if you’re under 13 years old
    * to provide related uses permitted by COPPA.
    
    If you’re under 13 years old, Roblox will not show these types of advertising to you:
    
    * behaviorally targeted ads – these are ads that are shown according to a user’s behavior on a website or app
    * retargeted ads – these are ads that are sent after a user starts a purchasing process but does not finish it. The ad tries to get the user to finish the purchase.
    
    We do not collect any information from users under 13 years old for the purposes of directing targeted advertising.

    For Advertising Purposes
    
    Roblox may disclose information collected from or about you with third-party advertising companies and/or advertising measurement companies to select advertisements for you, or measure and improve advertising effectiveness. In accordance with applicable law, we provide our users with choices about whether data is disclosed for this purpose. Data disclosed for this purpose includes:
    
    * Contact Identifiers
    * Device identifiers
    
    Depending on where you live, you may have additional rights that apply. For region-specific information, please visit Section 7 of this policy. Disclosing data for the purposes described in this Section may be considered a “sale” or “share” of personal information under the California Consumer Privacy Act. California residents can find more information about your rights in the [US State Privacy Policy Addendum](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/4402871541140).

    * To comply with reporting requirements
    * For any business or marketing purposes
    * To help us and others understand how, when, and why users visit our sites and use Roblox.
    
    We may share non-identifying data of all users regardless of their age.
    
    We’re not responsible if you share your own Personal Information
    
    If you’re 13 years old or over, you can share your Personal Information through chat, forums, messages or similar ways of sharing on our Service. Remember that anyone who uses these features will be able to see anything you share in this way. We are not responsible for how your Personal Information is used if you shared it yourself.
    
5. Looking after your information
    
    Security measures
    
    We have security measures that are intended to protect any Personal Information or other sensitive information under our control from loss, misuse, or alteration. Though we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of information will never occur, we use reasonable efforts to prevent it.
    
    Sending or storing information on the Internet is not 100% secure, so we can’t guarantee the security of any information you share with us. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we do not accept liability for unintentional disclosure.
    
    We’ll tell you if your privacy is at risk
    
    We may send you emails or other messages about security, privacy, and account management. If we learn about an incident that may qualify as a data breach under the law, we will notify you in accordance with the law.
    
    How long we keep your information
    
    We may keep your Personal Information for specific purposes as long as we need it to fulfill those purposes, sometimes even if you’ve stopped using Roblox’s Services. When we no longer require your Personal Information, we will de-identify or delete the information. Here are the reasons we may need to keep your information:  
    
    For resolving problems
    
    * We keep billing information and transaction histories so that we can resolve billing disputes or inquiries.
    * We keep user account history to solve any customer service issues and to provide, improve, and develop our service.
    
    To make our services safer
    
    * We may keep information if it will help us make our Service safer and more secure, such as to stop bad actors who try to misuse Roblox.
    
    For legal reasons
    
    * We may keep information for legal reasons, like establishing legal defenses, conducting audits, pursuing legitimate business purposes, enforcing our agreements, exercising our rights, or complying with legal obligations.
    
    Letting other users keep your information
    
    * Other users may keep publicly shared content and virtual items on our platform (e.g., if you create a virtual shirt and then sell it to another user, the virtual shirt will be kept on the platform because the other user now possesses it).
    
    Where we store your information
    
    Roblox is based in the United States. We send information we collect from you to our secure servers in the U.S. where we store and use it. This storage is necessary for us to process the information.
    
    We may also transfer information that we collect from you to our other offices and to the third parties mentioned in Section 4 of this Policy – these might be outside your region. Our agents or contractors may also use your information. The data protection laws of the U.S. or other countries may not be equivalent to those where you live.
    
    Wherever we transfer your Personal Information, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected. If required by applicable legislation, we rely on a valid international data transfer mechanism to enable cross-border data transfers.

If required by law, we will obtain your consent or the consent of a parent or legal guardian if any of these changes involve new material uses of your Personal Information not previously disclosed in this Privacy Policy.

Separate from account creation, users may optionally provide a parent email address. We process this information to give the user access to the Service and to communicate with the parent about the child’s account (if a parent email was provided). For example, we may use the parent’s email to send an email notification about the child’s account and an invitation for the parent to review the account and update settings. We may use the birthdate the child provides when signing up for the Service to determine which features on Roblox the child should have access to and to determine when the child will turn 13 years old and can be given broader access to features on our Service. This processing activity is based on Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. b GDPR (“performance of a contract”). In general, we will not use or share account information (including Personal Information) from a child’s account except for the permissible purposes stated in this Privacy Policy, and, if required by law, only with the prior verifiable consent of a parent or legal guardian (Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. a and Article 8 sec. 1 GDPR).
    
    Data Sharing
    
    Roblox may share users’ information, including Personal Information like billing information or usernames, with our third-party agents, contractors, or service providers who are hired to perform services on Roblox’s behalf.
    
    These providers may operate or support certain functions of the Service. Below is an illustrative list of functions for which we may use third party service providers and the names of the providers we may use to perform these functions:
    
    * Account Integrity and Security (e.g., Veriff, Persona, Arkose Labs);
    * Analytics services (e.g., Google LLC);
    * User Acquisition services (e.g., AppsFlyer);
    * Community filtering and moderation services (e.g., CommunitySift);
    * Customer support services (e.g., Zendesk);
    * Surveys and promotions (e.g., Reach3);
    * Social Media Log-in (e.g., SAP Customer Data Cloud);
    * Billing services and payment gateway providers (e.g., Kount, Worldpay, PayPal, Incomm, Blackhawk, Google, Apple, Amazon, Windows Store, Xbox, Playstation, Meta Quest, Xsolla); and
    * Hosting and content delivery network services (e.g., AWS, Equinix, CenturyLink, YouTube, Vimeo).
    
    The legal basis for this data transfer and processing activity is Article 28 of GDPR in conjunction with the data processing agreements we concluded with respective third-party agents. These agents and contractors are only allowed to use the information shared with them only for the specific tasks they’ve been hired to do and consistent with this Privacy Policy, and for no other purposes. Roblox takes steps to ensure that all service providers with access to Personal Information are capable of protecting the information we share with them.
    
    Further, the creators of the experiences you use or content you interact with will have access to your username, display name, user ID, game metrics, UGC transaction details, and your regional location (which we base on your IP address). We do not share your IP address with the creators. We provide creators with the regional location of players to determine their player base and make sure their experiences meet the legal requirements of the country you live in. The legal basis for this processing activity is Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. b (“performance of a contract”), Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. c (“compliance with legal obligation”) in compliance with the respective EEA or Member State law and lit. f (“legitimate interest”) GDPR. It is the creators’ legitimate interest to comply with non-EEA legal obligations.
    
    With your consent, Roblox will disclose information collected from or about you with advertisers and/or advertising measurement companies to select advertisements for you, or measure and improve advertising effectiveness. Data disclosed for this purpose includes contact identifiers and device identifiers. The legal basis for this processing activity is Article 6 sec. sent. 1 lit. a (“consent”).
    
    Legal disclosure
    
    We may disclose Personal Information about you, including the content of your communications on the Service, to comply with legal process, including court orders and subpoenas, served on our Service. In addition, we also may disclose Personal Information about you, including content, in response to a request from law enforcement agencies, regulators, or other public agencies (including schools or children services), or if such disclosure may (i) prevent the instigation of a crime, (ii) facilitate an investigation related to public safety or protect the safety of a child using our Service, (iii) protect the security or integrity of our Service, or (iv) enable us to take precautions against liability or to protect our rights. The legal basis for such disclosure is Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. c (“compliance with legal obligation”) in compliance with the respective EEA or Member State law and lit. f (“legitimate interest”) GDPR. It is our legitimate interest to comply with the legal requirements of U.S. law. Further, we have a legitimate interest in these purposes.

    Roblox is based in the U.S. Your Personal Information that we collect is sent to and stored on secure servers located in the United States of America. Such storage is necessary in order to process the information. Some of our agents and third-party service providers are located outside the European Economic Area, e.g. the United States. The data protection laws of the United States or other countries may not be as comprehensive or equivalent to those in your country of residence. Wherever we transfer your Personal Information, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected, e.g. conclude the [EU Standard Contractual Clauses](https://commission.europa.eu/publications/standard-contractual-clauses-international-transfers_en) with third parties.

    * Request (i) to receive the Personal Information concerning you, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and (ii) to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from our side.

When you use these features, certain information from your social media accounts may be accessed by or shared with Roblox, and likewise, certain information about your use of Roblox may be posted to your profile on those platforms. If you use your Roblox credentials to sign in to a third-party website or service, and later delete your Roblox account, you may lose access to such third-party website or service.
    * When you use voice based services from Roblox, we will collect, process, and store your voice recording to enable voice services and make our voice-related services safer. We will not engage in training or product improvement with private server voice chat recordings of Brazil users. With your consent, we will use voice recordings to inform training and product improvement.
    * When you request or agree to location-based services (users 13 years old and older), we may collect and track geolocation information so that we can offer services that depend on us knowing where you are. Examples are check-in, or personalizing content or advertising. We collect this information by using an identifier on your device or browser so that we can recognize you each time you return. To stop us collecting your location information, you can update your device settings, stop using the service, or uninstall our mobile apps.
    * If you join our experiences on a VR platform, we will collect your physical movement information in order to replicate your movement in the experience. This information is only used to provide the Service and is not stored.

    * If you opt-in to the Contact Importer feature, you consent to sharing with Roblox the first and last names and phone numbers of your contacts in your address book on your mobile phone, either at the time you register for our Service or otherwise. We do so to help you connect with your friends on our Service.
    * Interacting with our experiences.

    Automated Decision-Making
    
    Please note that we do not use your Personal Information for automated decision making which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you.
    
    Personal Information of Children and Parental Consent
    
    Please note that when users under the age of 13 register for the Service, their account is automatically set to to privacy-protective settings by default. This means that these users will not have access to certain features, such as social media plug-ins, some forms of third party advertising, and certain types of notification alerts.
    
    When a child creates an account on Roblox, we may process a username, password, birthdate, and gender (gender is optional). Separate from account creation, users may optionally provide the user access to the Service and to communicate with the parent about the child’s account (if a parent email was provided). For example, we may use the parent’s email to send an email notification about the child’s account and an invitation for the parent to review their child's account and update settings. We may use the birthdate the child provides when signing up for the Service to determine which features on Roblox the child should have access to and to determine when the child will turn 13 years old and can be given broader access to features on our Service.
    
    In general, we will not use or share account information (including Personal Information) from a child's account except for the permissible purposes stated in this Privacy Policy and, where applicable, only with the prior verifiable consent of a parent or legal guardian.
