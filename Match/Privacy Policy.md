**PRIVACY POLICY**

\_\_\_\_\_\_

Hey there! Welcome to Match’s Privacy Policy.

We know reading a privacy policy might not be everyone’s idea of a good time, but hear us out. We put a lot of effort into making this policy as clear and engaging as possible, because we actually want you to read it! Think of us as your digital wingmate, here to guide you through the ins and outs of what data we collect, and why and how we use it. So get cozy, grab your favorite drink , and let’s make privacy make sense – together.

This Privacy Policy applies from 01/02/2026. The previous version, available [here](https://uk.match.com/pages/misc/privacy_012026), applies until then.

### 1\. Who We Are

The company responsible for your data (the “data controller”) is:

Meetic S.A.S.  
MATCH  
53 rue de Châteaudun Paris 9 France

### 2\. Where This Privacy Policy Applies

This Privacy Policy applies to websites, apps, events and other services we operate under the Match brand. Whether you’re searching for your soulmate, joining us at one of our events, or using any of our other awesome services, this Policy has got you covered. For simplicity, we just refer to all of these as our “service” in this Privacy Policy.

If for some reason, one of our services requires its own separate privacy policy, then that policy will be made available to you and that policy—not this Privacy Policy—will apply.

### 3\. Data We Collect

It goes without saying, we can’t help you develop meaningful connections without you providing some information about yourself, like basic profile details and the types of people you’d like to meet. Using our service also generates some information, such as when you logged in and how you used the service, as well as the insights and inferences we generate based on the content you provide. We also collect data from third parties, like when you access the service through an account you have on another platform (e.g., Facebook, Google or Apple) or when you upload information from your account on another platform to complete your profile. If you’re interested in all the details, be sure to check out the table below.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Data you give us |     |
| Categories | Description |
| Account Data | When you create an account, you give us basic information for your account to be set up such as your phone number, email address, and date of birth. |
| Profile Data | When you complete your profile, you share additional details about you, such as your gender, interests, preferences, approximate location, etc. Some of this data may be considered sensitive or special in certain countries, such as details about sexual orientation, sexual life, health, or political beliefs. If you choose to provide this data, you consent to us using it as laid out in this Privacy Policy. |
| Content | When you use our service, you share photos, videos, audio, text and other types of content, such as your chats with other members. |
| Purchase Data | When you make a purchase or request a refund we keep the details of the transaction (e.g., what you purchased, the date of the transaction, and the price). The exact data depends on the payment method you choose. When you pay directly with us (rather than through a platform such as iOS or Android), you provide your debit or credit card number or other financial information. |
| Marketing, Survey and Research Data | We sometimes run (i) surveys, focus groups, or market studies for research purposes and (ii) promotions, events or contests for marketing purposes. When you choose to participate, you give us information to process your entry and participation, as well as your responses to our questions and your feedback. |
| Third-Party Data | When you choose to share information about other people (for example, if you use the contact details of someone you know for a given feature, or if you submit a query or report involving a member), we process this data on your behalf to complete your request. |

Finally, our moderation tools and teams collect additional data as part of their investigations.<br><br>Further, we are part of the [Match Group family of businesses](https://mtch.com/ourcompany). Match Group considers the safety and security of members a top priority. If you were banned from another Match Group service, your data can be shared with us to allow us to take necessary actions, including closing your account or preventing you from creating an account on our service.<br><br>Where legally allowed, we also receive information about suspected or confirmed bad actors from third parties as part of our efforts to ensure our members’ safety and security. |
| Social Media Data | You can share data with us through your accounts on other platforms (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Spotify, Apple), for instance if you decide to create and log into your account via these platforms or if you decide to upload data such as photos or playlists onto our service from these platforms. |

| Technical Data | Using the service involves the collection of data from and about the device(s) you use to access our service, including hardware and software information such as IP address, device ID, device type, operating system and configurations, network information, as well as app settings and characteristics, app crashes, advertising IDs and identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that can uniquely identify a device or browser.

### 4\. Why and How We Use Your Data

The main reason we process your data is to provide our service to you and improve it over time. That includes connecting you with members who might make your heart skip a beat, personalizing your experience, and just helping you make the most of our service. We also process your data to keep our service, you, and others safe and secure. We take this responsibility very seriously, and we’re always working to improve the safety and security of our systems and processes. And yes, we process your data to show relevant ads – you can control this in your settings. Read on for a more detailed explanation.

### 5\. How We Share Data

Since our goal is to help you make meaningful connections, some of your information is of course visible to other members on the service. We also share data with service providers and partners who assist us in operating the service, with other Match Group companies for the reasons laid out below and, in some cases, for legal and related reasons.

Some of our advertising partners enable us to transform your email address, advertising identifiers or phone number into an identifier that can’t be used to identify you personally and then use that unique identifier to either exclude you from our marketing campaigns, or to target our ads at an audience that is similar to you in terms of background, interests or app usage. | *   Account Data<br>*   Profile Data<br>*   Usage Data<br>*   Technical Data<br>*   Insights and Inferences |

### 6\. How Match Group Companies Work Together

Match is part of the [Match Group family of businesses](https://mtch.com/ourcompany).

We share data about you with our Affiliates and they share data about you with us, for the reasons laid out below:

*   To make all Match Group platforms safer, for instance by searching for and identifying bad actors and how they operate across Match Group platforms, as well as making sure that when a bad actor is found on one Match Group platform (for instance ours), they can be banned from all.
*   To assist each other, as service providers, in data processing operations, such as data hosting and maintenance, customer care, marketing and targeted advertising, analytics, machine learning development and implementation, finance and accounting, legal support, payment processing, service improvement, data security and fighting against spam, abuse, fraud and other wrongdoings.
*   To suggest to you relevant and meaningful connections, by developing or improving Match Group Brands’ core recommendation systems.
*   To improve your chances at building significant connections with others, we may make you visible on other Match Group services or allow you to benefit from cross-platform functionalities.
*   Where and as allowed under applicable law, to better understand how people use Match Group services overall, to personalize your experience across Match Group services and to enhance marketing and advertising campaigns.
*   For other legitimate business purposes including corporate / consolidated audit, analysis and reporting.

### 7\. Cross-Border Data Transfers

Because we operate a global service, the sharing of your data laid out in Section 5 involves cross-border data transfers to our Affiliates and service providers (other third parties) in third countries that have different privacy laws. When we transfer personal data to a third-country we use appropriate mechanisms. For example, we rely on:

*   Adequacy decisions issued by the [European Commission](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en) or other competent authorities under applicable laws. We transfer personal data to our Affiliates to perform important functions, as outlined in Section 6, by storing, accessing or otherwise processing data and to third-parties in countries with adequacy decisions for the purposes outlined in Section 5.
*   [Standard contractual clauses](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en) issued by the European Commission or similar contractual data transfer mechanisms approved by other competent authorities under applicable laws. These contractual data transfer mechanisms are commitments between companies transferring personal data, binding them to protect the confidentiality and security of your data and ensuring adequate level of protection in third countries. We rely on such mechanisms to transfer personal data to our Affiliates to perform important functions, as outlined in Section 6, by storing, accessing or otherwise processing data, and to third parties for the purposes outlined in Section 5 in countries without adequacy decisions, such as the United States of America. [Contact us](https://uk.match.com/faq/#privacyRequest) for a copy.

### 8\. Your Rights

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Your Rights | How to exercise it |
| Access, Portability or To Know<br><br>Right to be informed of the personal data we process about you and/or ask for a copy of it | You can access and review some data directly by logging into your account. You can also retrieve a copy of your data by following the process explained [here](https://uk.match.com/faq/#privacyRequest). |
| Rectification or Correction<br><br>Right to amend or update your personal data where it’s inaccurate or incomplete | You can update your data directly within the service by simply updating your profile. If you wish to rectify other data, please contact us [here](https://uk.match.com/faq/#privacyRequest). |
| Deletion or Erasure<br><br>Right to delete personal data | You can delete some of the data you provided us directly within the service. You can also close your account as explained [here](https://uk.match.com/faq/?answer=0009_Unsubscription) and we’ll delete your data as laid out in this Privacy Policy. In any event, you can always contact us [here](https://uk.match.com/faq/#privacyRequest). |
| Objection (Opt-out) or Restriction<br><br>Right to object to us processing personal data or to request that we temporarily or permanently stop processing personal data | You can directly opt-out from certain of your personal data processing in your account settings. Otherwise you can contact us [here](https://uk.match.com/faq/#privacyRequest) should you wish to object to or restrict a data processing we’ve listed throughout this Privacy Policy. |
| Consent Withdrawal  <br>Right to withdraw a consent you’ve given us to process your personal data for a specific purpose | You can directly withdraw consent you’ve given us either by updating your account settings or removing Device Permissions you’ve agreed to in your device settings (e.g., access to specific types of device data such as phone contacts, photospictures, advertising identifiers and location services, or consent to receive push notifications). When you withdraw consent, certain services may lose functionality. You can always contact us [here](https://uk.match.com/faq/#privacyRequest) for more information. |

We want you to be in control of your data, so we want to remind you of the following rights, options and tools available to you. Depending on where you live, these rights may not apply to you or they may be named differently. If you have any questions on your rights and how to exercise them, please contact us [here](https://uk.match.com/faq/#privacyRequest).

For your protection and the protection of all of our members, we may ask you for information to verify your identity or authority to act on behalf of a member before we can answer the above requests. We wouldn’t want someone else to get in control of your data!

Keep in mind, we can reject requests, including if we are unable to authenticate you, if the request is unlawful or invalid, or if it could infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or the privacy or other rights of someone else. If you wish to receive information relating to another member, the other member will have to make a request themselves.

In certain countries, including in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, you have a right to a judicial remedy and to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority if you have concerns about how we process your personal data. You can find information about your data protection regulator in the European Economic Area [here](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en), and in the United Kingdom [here](https://ico.org.uk/). The data protection authority you can lodge a complaint with can be that of your habitual residence, where you work or where an alleged infringement took place.

### 9\. How Long We Retain Your Data

We want the connections you make through our service to last forever, but we keep your personal data only as long as necessary for legitimate business reasons (as laid out in Section 4) and as permitted by applicable law.

If you decide to stop using our service, you can close your account and your profile will no longer be visible to other members. Note that we will close your account automatically if you are inactive for two years.

Following account closure, we delete your data as laid out below:

1.  To protect the safety and security of our members, we implement a safety retention window of three months following account closure. During this period, we keep your data to investigate unlawful or harmful conducts. The retention of data during this safety retention window is based on our legitimate interest as well as that of potential third-party victims.
2.  We maintain limited data to comply with legal data retention obligations: in particular, we keep transaction data for 10 years to comply with tax and accounting legal requirements, credit card information for the duration the user can challenge the transaction, and “traffic data” / logs for one year to comply with legal data retention obligations. We also keep records of consents members give us for five years to comply and evidence our compliance with applicable law.
3.  We maintain limited data on the basis of our legitimate interest: we keep user generated content associated with banned account for two years; customer care records and supporting data for six years from the date of the communication, imprecise location of download/purchase for five years in support of our safety efforts, to support our customer care decisions, enforce our rights and enable us to defend ourselves in the event of a claim; profile data for one year in anticipation of potential litigation, for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; and data necessary to prevent members who were banned from opening a new account for as long as necessary to ensure the safety and vital interests of our members.
4.  Finally, we maintain data on the basis of our legitimate interest where there is an outstanding or potential issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep data, in particular if we receive a valid legal subpoena or request asking us to preserve data (in which case we would need to keep the data to comply with our legal obligations) or if data would otherwise be necessary as part of legal proceedings.

Where appropriate and as legally permitted, we may maintain and use data that, by itself, cannot identify or be attributed specifically to you for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including to improve our service and create new features, technologies and services, including through machine learning, and keep Match Group services safe.

### 10\. Children’s Privacy

Our service is restricted to individuals who are 18 years of age or older. We do not permit individuals under the age of 18 on our platform. If you suspect that a member is under the age of 18, please use the reporting mechanism available on the service.

### 11\. Privacy Policy Changes

This policy will change over time. We’re always looking for new and innovative ways to help you build meaningful connections and strive to make sure explanations of our data practices remain up-to-date. We will notify you before material changes take effect so that you have time to review the changes.
