**Definitions and scope**

1.1.

All capitalised terms used but not defined herein have the same meaning as defined in the IAB Terms, except for the following definitions, which are amended and now read in these WeTransfer Terms, the IAB Terms, the IO and the Annexes as follows: **"Ad"** means any advertisement (included but not limited to branded content) created by Media Company, whether or not based on or following from the Advertising Materials. **"Advertising Materials"** means content for Ads, including artwork, copy, audio or video content, or active URLs. **"Media Company Properties"** means websites, (online) newsletters, podcasts, videos, webseries, or Internet audio or video channels specified on an IO that are owned, operated, or controlled by Media Company. **"Network Properties"** means websites, podcasts, webseries, or Internet audio or video channels or platforms specified on an IO that are not owned, operated, or controlled by Media Company, but on which Media Company has a contractual right to serve Ads. The following definitions are added and have the following meaning: **"Agreement"** means the agreement entered into between Media Company and Customer, consisting of the IO, the WeTransfer Terms, the Annexes (Studio and/or Branded Content) and the IAB Terms. **"Customer"** means the counterparty to Media Company under this Agreement, as described on and that has signed the IO. **"Effective Date"** is the signatory date of the IO. **"Intellectual Property Rights"** means patents, trademarks, service marks, trade and business names, copyrights, topography rights, domain names, database rights and design rights whether or not any of them are registered and including applications for any of them, trade secrets and rights of confidence; all rights or forms of protection of a similar nature or having similar or equivalent effect to any of them which may subsist anywhere in the world. **“Newsletter Deliverables”** means Deliverables sold on a cost per sent newsletter (via email) basis. **"Postponement"** means the explicit or implicit rescheduling of (a part of) the delivery of the Ad for any reason, to a date later than the IO start date, caused or instructed by Customer

1.2.

Contrary to the introduction of the IAB Terms, also in the event Customer is another party than an Agency (for instance but not limited to an Advertiser), all rights and obligations as set out in the IAB Terms that apply to an Agency, will apply mutatis mutandis to Customer.

1.3.

Notwithstanding Section XIV.c. of the IAB Terms, the Agreement between Customer and Media Company consists of the IO, these WeTransfer Terms, the Annexes and the IAB Terms. In the event of a conflict between any of the contract elements forming parts of the Agreement, the order of priority is: i) IO, ii) WeTransfer Terms, iii) Annexes and iv) IAB Terms. Media Company does not accept the terms and conditions and/or the insertion order of Customer or any third party, which therefore do not form part of the Agreement and are not binding on Media Company. Revisions to accepted IOs must be made in writing and accepted by the other party in writing.

1.4.

Unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing, Media Company’s proposals and offers are valid for 30 (thirty) days. The Agreement will enter into force on the Effective Date, provided that WeTransfer has received the IO signed by Customer in which Customer accepts the WeTransfer Terms, the Annex(es) and the IAB Terms. Inventory cannot be reserved and/or guaranteed before the Effective Date. The Agreement will terminate upon completion of the IO (the End Date as set out on the IO).

2.3.

Further to Section II.d of the IAB Terms, Media Company does not provide any warranty regarding competitor adjacencies for Ads that appear on Media Company Properties. Per Customer’s written request, Media Company will however, use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with Customer’s wishes on competitor adjacencies.

2.4.

Further to Section III.b. of the IAB Terms, in the event Media Company has not received payment within the agreed payment term, Media Company is entitled to (i) cancel all current and future IO’s of Customer and (ii) to immediately invoice all pending, signed IO’s and costs incurred until the date of cancellation.

2.5.

Section III.c. of the IAB Terms is amended and now reads as follows: _Customer is solely responsible for the collection of the fees it has invoiced to its own customers.

The last sentence of section VI.a. of the IAB Terms is amended and reads as follows: _If the underdelivery is greater than 10% in relation to the number of Deliverables in the applicable IO, Agency and Media Company may arrange for a makegood consistent with these Terms. If under-delivery is less than 10% in relation to the number of Deliverables in the applicable IO, no makegood is available. As Media Company only invoices actual Deliverables, the underdelivery will be reflected in the invoice automatically._

2.9.

Contrary to Section VI.b. second sentence of the IAB Terms, Media Company only invoices actual Deliverables based on its own records, so Agency cannot execute a credit equal to the value of the under-delivered portion of the IO for which it was charged.

Media Company explicitly disclaims all liabilities with regard to the Service and it makes no warranty that the Service is on an error-free basis.

2.15.

Section XII d (ii) of the IAB Terms is amended and reads as follows: Media Company may derive anonymous and non personally identifiable data from Collected Data and may combine, use and disclose such data for Media Company’s general business purposes (such as marketing and public relations).

Section XIII. of the IAB Terms is deleted in its entirety and replaced by the following: _In the event that an invoice is established on the basis of records and there are discrepancies between the records of both parties (for instance in Deliverables or locations of Deliverables), parties may share their records and will discuss an amicable solution in good faith. In the event parties don’t succeed in reaching an agreement, the records of Media Company shall prevail and form the basis of the invoice_.

2.17.

Further to Section XIV.a. of the IAB Terms, Advertiser represents and warrants that the Advertising Materials comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including but not limited to local and sector specific advertising codes and industry guidelines regarding advertising and promotional campaigns (collectively, “Advertising Laws”).

2.18.

Contrary to Section XIV.d. of the IAB Terms, the Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it shall be exclusively construed, governed and interpreted by the laws of The Netherlands. For dispute resolution Parties will first file a request for mediation with the NAI secretariat in accordance with the NAI Mediation Rules. If such request fails to result in a comprehensive resolution, the dispute or any part thereof shall be resolved exclusively in accordance with the NAI Arbitration Rules. In such event the arbitral tribunal shall be composed of one arbitrator. The place of arbitration shall be Amsterdam and the arbitral procedure shall be conducted in the English language.
