* Why and how we use cookies
    
    We place cookies with the intention of making WeTransfer even better. We work hard to make our Services safe, beautiful and unobtrusive. Feel free to block cookies, but this may affect how well our Services work.
    
    We place several cookies (or similar technologies, like SDKs, pixels or web beacons) on your device for the purpose of facilitating your use of the Service and to find out how the Service may be improved. We or our advertising partners also place cookies on our website(s). Being a global service, these partners can vary per country. When our advertising partners place cookies, these cookies can process personal information to measure the effectiveness of the campaign.
    
    Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer by your browser when you visit a website. Examples of cookie purposes are: your language preferences, logging into an account, remembering login details, serving you personalised advertisements and acceptance of the Terms of Service and Privacy & Cookie Statement. Our website can place these cookies for the following purposes:
    
    * **Functional cookies** are used to provide functionalities when using our Service, such as the possibility to set preferences or to remember your previous settings.
    
    * **Analytical cookies** are used to optimise our Service. For example to optimise the usability of our website by AB-testing a new feature, to make the website more user-friendly and to analyse how you use our Service. We also use analytical cookies to stop bots and malicious behaviour like spam. When we use analytical cookies, this could include third party cookies, as found in the cookie list. These third party analytical cookies process personal information, which is detailed in the cookie list too.
    
    * **Advertisement cookies** are used for commercial, editorial and promotional purposes. With these cookies your internet- and surf behaviour can be followed over various domains and websites. We do not track the website you visit after you leave our website. Advertisement cookies are often also placed by third parties to measure the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns and to follow your internet- and surf behaviour over other domains and websites where they have placed a cookie. WeTransfer does not have access to or control over personal information collected via these cookies or other features that advertisers and third parties may use. Our Privacy & Cookie Statement is therefore not applicable to these third party cookies and we refer you to third parties’ Privacy Statements to read how they handle personal information. You can find a list of the limited amount of third party cookies and a link to their privacy policies [here](https://wetransfer.com/explore/legal/in-app-tracking-technologies).
    
    * **Pixel tags or web beacons** are a piece of code embedded on the website that collects personal information about users' engagement on that web page. The use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement. The pixel also allows us to see from which previous website or channel a user arrived at our website.
    
      
    
    We have an extensive cookie list available [here](https://wetransfer.com/explore/legal/in-app-tracking-technologies), which we will update at least four times a year. Due to the changing nature of our Service, this may result in the cookie list not being fully up to date at times. If you would want to remove certain cookies, or block them from being stored in your browser, it is possible to arrange this through your browser settings for cookies. You can find these settings under the Privacy tab in the Preferences section of most browsers. Here you can specify your cookie preferences or remove cookies. Please note that if you remove or refuse WeTransfer cookies, the Service might not function in optimal form.
    
* How we operate as a global business
    
    We are a business with a global footprint. Therefore we work together with WeTransfer entities and partners outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). This means that we might transmit or store certain personal information to them. 
    
    Those entities and partners may reside in countries which have different data protection laws in place - and, in some cases these offer less protection to your information. To ensure that you and your personal information enjoy a similar level of protection as under the EU GDPR, we will make sure that appropriate safeguards are in place, such as technical, legal, and organizational measures. Examples are pseudonymisation, encryption, and policies to challenge disproportionate legal access by governments. 
    
    When transmitting personal information to other WeTransfer entities, or to third parties, such as service providers and marketing partners, who are located outside the EEA, we ensure that either:
    
    * The European Commission has issued a so-called “[Adequacy Decision](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en)” regarding the country where the entity or third-party is located. This is the case for: our subsidiary as well as third-parties based in the UK, third parties based in Canada, Israel, and Switzerland, and certain third parties based in the USA who have certified themselves under the [EU-US Data Privacy Framework](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/). When this is the case, we conduct a review to ascertain whether their certification is still active.  
    
    * We have signed special contracts, called “[Standard Contractual Clauses](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en)”, with our Affiliates or third-party. These clauses require the other party to protect your information and to provide you with EU-level rights and protections. You can exercise your rights under the Standard Contractual Clauses by contacting us or the third party who processes your personal information
    
* How we protect your personal information
    
    WeTransfer takes technical and organisational measures to protect your personal information against loss or other forms of unlawful processing. We take these measures against industry standards and certifications. 
    
    We have policies and measures in place to pseudonymise, encrypt, and anonymise personal information. Moreover, we have safeguards in place to make personal information only accessible by those who need access to do their job and that they are properly authorised. We monitor activity on our servers and on company devices, such as laptops, to ensure the security and safety of personal information.
    
    WeTransfer staff is required to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with the company’s guidelines regarding confidentiality, ethics, and appropriate usage of personal information. Staff is required to sign a confidentiality agreement and undergoes periodic security training.
    
* How long we keep your personal information
    
    The retention period for your personal information depends on which Service you use and on which category of personal information we’re talking about. Always check out the website(s) or app(s) of the Service(s) for the specific information on retention periods.
    
    Personal Information
    
    WeTransfer retains your personal information as long as its necessary to provide our Services to you (e.g. upholding your user account), to conduct our business activities and fulfill our legitimate interests, such as providing safe and secure services, to fix bugs and to reach out to you, to comply with applicable laws (e.g. retaining financial information for 7 years for tax purposes; or retaining personal information after receiving government data preservation orders), to review, challenge, or comply with legal requests, and to resolve (legal) disputes. 
    
    If we process your personal data on behalf of your organization, we will retain such personal data in accordance with the terms and conditions of our data processing agreement with them, subject to applicable law. 
    
      
    
    User Content
    
    Your User Content will be deleted automatically and permanently from our servers within 48 hours from the expiration you selected if it's not set to “Recoverable” or otherwise within 1 year after expiration, unless you choose to delete it earlier.
    
    Where your User Content and/or personal information has been reported, detected, blocked, or removed due to suspicious, infringing, or illegal activity, we may keep limited information in relation to you and that activity for a limited period of time. This is to:

* Your rights and choices
    
    You have certain rights under GDPR, and similar privacy laws. This section explains the different types of rights, how to exercise them, and whether they may be subject to certain limitations. After receiving your request, WeTransfer will respond within the time period limits provided by the relevant law. In the EEA and UK, the time period is one month. 
    
    **Access your information** You have the right to receive access to your personal information, including a copy thereof. You can request this by reaching out to us. 
    
    **Rectify your information** If your Personal Information has changed, or if you believe it’s incorrect, you have the right to correct the Personal Information. If you have an account, you can adjust most of your Personal Information via your account settings. Otherwise, you can request us to rectify it for you.
    
    **Delete your information**
    
    You can request deletion of your personal information by reaching out to us. In some of our products or apps it’s also possible to delete your account via your account settings. 
    
    There are scenarios where we can't erase your personal information, such as when:
    
    * The data is still needed for the reason we gathered it.
    
    * WeTransfer’s interest in using the information outweighs your wish for its deletion. This might be the case when we require the data to protect our services from fraudulent or illegal activities.
    
    * WeTransfer has a legal obligation to retain the data, or
    
    * WeTransfer requires the data to establish, exercise, or defend against legal action. For example, when there’s an unresolved matter linked to your account.
    
      
    
    **Port your information**
    
    In certain scenarios, you have the right to request a copy of your personal data in electronic (“machine-readable”) format. You can request us to transmit your data when we are processing your personal data on the legal bases of consent or performance of contract. We will honor this request to the extent possible.
    
    **Object to the processing of your information**
    
    When we process your personal information for the legitimate interests of WeTransfer or a third party, you may object to the processing of your personal information. You can either do this via “Your Privacy Choices” or account settings, or by contacting us. When you contact us, we ask you to provide all relevant information. This includes the processing activity you are objecting to, why you want to object, how the processing activity affects you, as well as any additional information that you think will help us review your request. We will stop the particular processing if we don't have compelling legitimate grounds to continue that processing and if we don’t need it for legal claims. 
    
    **Restrict the processing of your information** 
    
    You can request us to (temporarily) restrict the processing of your personal information. For instance, if (1)  you believe your personal data is inaccurate, or (2) when the processing is unlawful but you oppose deletion of the data, or (3) you require the data to be retained in relation to a legal claim or defense, or (4) you have objected to the processing and are awaiting our response.
    
    **Lodge a complaint**
    
    If you’re unhappy with how we’ve handled your request or your personal information, we encourage you to contact us. You also have the right to file a complaint with our lead supervisory authority, the Dutch “[Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens](https://www.autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/en)” (based in The Netherlands) or with your [local supervisory authority](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en%E2%80%9D.). 
    
    **Withdrawal of consent**
    
    When you’ve provided your consent for us to process your personal information, you can withdraw your consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing activities based on consent before its withdrawal. If you withdraw your consent, we will no longer process the personal information which we’ve received based on your consent. You can withdraw your consent via “Your Privacy Choices” or by contacting us. 
    
    **How to exercise your rights**
    
    To exercise any of the above rights, please contact us via [privacy@wetransfer.com](mailto:privacy@wetransfer.com). Before we can respond to a request to exercise one or more of the rights listed above, you may be required to verify your identity or your account details or provide additional information so that we can understand your request.
