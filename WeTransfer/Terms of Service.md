(“**WeTransfer**”, “**we**, “**us**”, or “**our**”). These Terms govern your access and use of our websites where these Terms are posted (the “**Sites**”), our mobile applications (the “**Apps**”), and our related content, products, and services (collectively, and together with the Sites and the Apps, the “**Service**”). **THESE TERMS CONTAIN VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS, AS WELL AS CONDITIONS, LIMITATIONS, DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES, AND EXCLUSIONS THAT MIGHT APPLY TO YOU. THESE TERMS ALSO CONTAIN PROVISIONS REGARDING THE AUTOMATIC RENEWING OF YOUR SUBSCRIPTION. THESE TERMS REQUIRE THE USE OF ARBITRATION TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS. PLEASE READ THEM CAREFULLY.**

1.2. **Important Notice.** **THESE TERMS CONTAIN A BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION REQUIREMENT AND CLASS-ACTION WAIVER, WHICH MEANS YOU AND WETRANSFER AGREE TO RESOLVE MOST DISPUTES IN BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND NOT BY MEANS OF A CLASS ARBITRATION, A CLASS ACTION, ANY OTHER KIND OF REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, OR A JURY TRIAL (SEE SECTION 16 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION; BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION)). YOU MAY OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION REQUIREMENT WITHIN 30 DAYS OF ACCEPTING THESE TERMS; INSTRUCTIONS FOR OPTING OUT ARE IN SECTION 16 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION; BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION) BELOW.**

1.3. **Binding Agreement.** By downloading, installing or using the Service in any manner, you agree to these Terms and you agree to comply with and be bound by any applicable guidelines, policies and additional terms—which form part of these Terms—as made available to you on one or more of the Sites, as well as by any specific, supplemental or third-party licenses, terms, or policies when using the Service. **IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS IN THESE TERMS, DO NOT ACCESS AND IMMEDIATELY STOP USING THE SERVICE, CANCEL ANY ACCOUNT, AND IMMEDIATELY UNINSTALL AND DELETE ANY COPIES OF ANY APPS OR SOFTWARE INCLUDED IN THE SERVICE IN YOUR POSSESSION.**

1.4. **Language.** These Terms were originally drafted in English. If there is any conflict between the English-language version of these Terms and a version translated into another language, the English-language version will prevail.

1.5. **Privacy.** Our [Privacy & Cookie Policy](https://wetransfer.com/explore/legal/privacy) provides information about the processing of personal data in connection with the Service, including how data is collected, for which purposes it is processed, and for how long it is retained. To the extent that we process personal data on your behalf as a data processor under applicable privacy laws, the [Data Processing Agreement](https://wetransfer.com/documents/WeTransfer_Data_Processing_Agreement.pdf) applies and is incorporated by reference into these Terms.

1.6. **Contact Information.** You can contact us via our [Help Center](https://help.wetransfer.com/hc/en-us). If we have to contact or notify you, we will do so by using the contact or account information you provided to us or via notification within the Service or other reasonable method.

2\. Changes to the Terms and the Service
----------------------------------------

2.1. **Changes to the Terms.** We may update these Terms from time to time, in our sole discretion (for example, when we remove or release new features, technologies, or services, to comply with legal, regulatory, or contractual requirements, or in response to exceptional or unforeseen circumstances). In such cases, we will take reasonable measures to inform you, in accordance with the significance of the changes performed, for example, by revising the date at the top of the updated Terms, via email or as a pop-up or push notification within the Service. It is your responsibility to review the Terms regularly, and to check the Service for updates to these Terms regularly. Unless otherwise noted, the updated Terms will be effective as of the time at which we post the updated Terms in the Service. By continuing to access or use our Service after updates become effective, you agree to be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you must immediately stop using our Service, uninstall and delete any copies of any Apps or software included in the Service in your possession, and cancel your subscription and any account.

2.2. **Changes to the Service.** We have no obligation to provide updates, upgrades, or future versions of the Service. We may update, change, suspend or discontinue the Service (or any part, content or feature) or Subscription Plan (as defined below) at any time, without notice and without liability to you or anyone else (for example, to offer or test new or different features, technologies, or services, to repair, improve or further develop the Service, to comply with legal, regulatory or contractual requirements, or in response to exceptional or unforeseen circumstances). Such changes, updates, suspensions, discontinuations may also result in adjustment to the applicable Subscription Fee (as defined below), including price increases, which will be effective upon the renewal of your Subscription Plan. Some services and features may not be available in all countries, in all languages, or in all operating systems.

3\. Eligibility

3.1. **Age.** THE SERVICE IS NOT AVAILABLE TO INDIVIDUALS UNDER THE AGE OF 16.

You agree to comply with all applicable trade, economic sanctions, and export control laws, including those of the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and any other relevant jurisdictions (“**Export Laws**”), in connection with your access to and use of the Service. You may not access, use, export, re-export, transfer, or otherwise make available the Service, directly or indirectly: (a) into any country or territory subject to comprehensive trade sanctions or embargoes under applicable Export Laws, or (b) to any individual, entity, or organization listed on any applicable restricted party list maintained by relevant authorities. You state that: (i) you are not located in, organized under the laws of, or ordinarily resident in any country or territory that is the subject of comprehensive sanctions or embargoes under applicable Export Laws; (ii) you are not an individual or entity that appears on any applicable sanctions or restricted parties lists maintained by competent government authorities; and (iii) you will not use the Service for any purposes prohibited by Export Laws and in any manner that would cause any party to be in violation of applicable Export Laws. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your Subscription Plan or your access to the Service in accordance with section 14, if we determine that such an action is required to comply with applicable Export Laws.

4\. Your Account
----------------

4.1. **Account Information.** Although these Terms apply regardless of whether you create or use an account, the use of certain features of the Service may require you to have an account. In such cases, these Terms also govern your account. You must provide only true, current and accurate information when you create your account or provide us with the required information and meet the eligibility requirements under these Terms and [Pricing](https://wetransfer.com/pricing). You agree to update your registration information to keep it accurate and current. We may ask you to confirm your registration information (such as your email address) to continue using the Service. If you choose not to do so, your access to the Service may be restricted or terminated. When you choose a username or otherwise create a nickname, you agree not to use any name that is unlawful, fraudulent, deceptive, harmful, defamatory, inaccurate, abusive, offensive, threatening, hateful, violent, harassing, discriminatory or racist, or any name that infringes or violates another person’s rights (including, but not limited to, intellectual property rights, and rights of privacy and publicity). You agree not to impersonate any person or misrepresent your identity or affiliation with any person. You further agree not to purchase, sell, rent, or give away your account, or share your registration information. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, you are responsible for anything that happens through your account and all uses of your registration information, including, but not limited to, purchases, whether or not authorized by you.

4.2. **Account Security.** In the event you become aware of or reasonably suspect any breach of security, including any loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure, of your registration information, you must immediately notify us and modify your registration information. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and the confidentiality of your registration information. If required, you must use a strong password for your account that is unique to the Service and not used by you in any other service.

4.3. **Multi-Seat Account.** If your Subscription Plan permits it, you may enable more than one individual user to access and use the Service (“**Authorized Users**”) under your account (“**Multi-Seat Account**”) during the Subscription Period (as defined below), subject to the number of seats and other conditions as specified in [Pricing](https://wetransfer.com/pricing) or in the order form through which you purchased your Subscription Plan (“**Order Form**”). Each seat on a Multi-Seat Account may only be used by one Authorized User. Subject to the terms of the applicable Subscription Plan, a Multi-Seat Account may allow you to, or require that you, enable one or more administrators (“**Account Administrators**”) to manage, access, and use the account and any associated Content (as defined below), and to enable or remove Authorized Users. We may provide you with instructions on how to enable access to the Multi-Seat Account by the Authorized Users, which may include, without limitation, the provision of a private link to access our account creation portal for the Service. If you purchase a Subscription Plan for a Multi-Seat Account as a legal entity in connection with your business, you may assign seats to your employees or those of your affiliates, who will be considered your Authorized Users. In this case, seats on your Multi-Seat Account may only be used for activities related to your business or that of your affiliates. If an employee leaves your or your affiliate’s organization, you must notify us with the account details associated with the relevant seat, and we will then disable that seat. Once disabled, it may be reassigned to a new employee, provided that the new Authorized User completes the onboarding process and a new account is created. Any subscriptions acquired by Authorized Users outside the onboarding method we provide will not be considered part of your Multi-Seat Account and may incur separate billing. You agree that we are not responsible for the use of your Multi-Seat Account or the Service by your Authorized Users, and you are responsible for ensuring that they comply with the Terms. You are also solely responsible for implementing any measures you deem reasonably necessary to safeguard your proprietary or confidential information. We may monitor and enforce Subscription Plan limitations and restrictions, including, but not limited to, the right to charge for overages.

4.4. **Inactive Account.** We will consider your account as inactive if you have not accessed your account for 12 months and you do not have an active paid Subscription Plan. You are responsible for keeping your account active. We may delete or close your account if it becomes inactive.

4.5. **Device.** If you use or access the Service with any mobile phone, tablet, laptop, desktop computer or other device not owned by you, you must have the device owner’s permission to do so. You will be responsible for complying with these Terms, whether or not you own the device.

5\. Service License

In any event, we do not guarantee the availability of the Service. You agree that the Service may be disrupted, unavailable, or inoperable, including due to (a) unforeseeable circumstances, or foreseeable circumstances that despite our reasonable measures to prevent are not within our ability to fully prevent (including, but not limited to, widespread internet disruptions, interruption of services by our service providers that was not caused by us, and malicious third-party acts), (b) emergency security measures, or (c) planned downtime (in this case, we will use reasonable efforts to inform you, for example, with a notice within the Service). We are not responsible for any disruption or loss that you may suffer as a result of any unavailability of the Service in accordance with this section.

5.3. **Trials and Betas.** We may offer optional access to features on a free, trial, beta, or early access basis (“**Trials and Betas**”) and we may perform other product validations techniques.

You acknowledge that Trials and Betas may be inoperable, incomplete or include features that are not released outside of Trials and Betas.

Your Content will be available to you to export or download depending on your Subscription Plan and only during the period specified under the terms of the applicable feature or your Subscription Plan, after which we have no obligation to maintain, and we may delete your Content from the Service.

8\. Subscription Plan and Automatic Renewals; Fees and Payments
---------------------------------------------------------------

8.1. **Subscription Plan.** One or more features of the Service may require a subscription plan (“**Subscription Plan**”) which may automatically renew. The license period for the applicable Subscription Plan (“**Subscription Period**”) may vary, for example, with weekly, monthly or annual terms as specified at checkout when you purchase your Subscription Plan or in your Order Form. Each Subscription Plan may have one or more eligibility requirements and authorized uses as set out in [Pricing](https://wetransfer.com/pricing). **Upon expiration of the Subscription Period, your Subscription Plan will automatically renew for recurring Subscription Periods of the same duration,** unless the Subscription Plan is canceled or not renewed in accordance with these Terms. **If you purchase a Subscription Plan other than through an Order Form, (a) you authorize us to charge the applicable Subscription Fee to your designated payment method for your initial Subscription Period and automatically upon each renewal with no further action required by you**, and (b) you must keep your payment method up to date in your account settings or by contacting us via our [Help Center](https://help.wetransfer.com/hc/en-us).

8.2. **Non-Renewal. If you purchase your Subscription Plan through one of the Sites, you can manage and cancel your subscription and any automatic renewals at any time from your account settings. If you purchase your Subscription Plan through an App, you can cancel your subscription and automatic renewals at any time in your account settings with the App Marketplace according to the policies of each App Marketplace. Uninstalling an App will not result in the cancellation of your subscription. If you purchase your Subscription Plan through an Order Form, you can cancel your subscription and any automatic renewals by providing written notice of termination to the contacts specified in your Order Form, at least one month before the end of the then-current Subscription Period.** We may elect to not renew a Subscription Plan by providing notice to you before the end of the then-current Subscription Period. If you have begun a Subscription Period and you then decide to cancel your subscription during such period, you will not receive a refund for the fees you already paid for such Subscription Period, and you will continue to be able to use the Service for which you subscribed until the end of such Subscription Period. The expiration of the Subscription Plan due to any non-renewal will be effective as of the end of the then-current Subscription Period. Unused add-ons, features, seats, or any other items of your Subscription Plan will not be reimbursed and do not rollover to any subsequent Subscription Period or renewal term, if applicable. You can downgrade your Subscription Plan or reduce your add-ons, features, or seats in your account, but such downgrades will not become effective until the end of your current Subscription Period, and you will not receive a refund or credit for such downgrade or reductions. Downgrading your Subscription Plan may cause loss of features, seats, data, or functionality of the Service available to you, and we will not be responsible for any such loss.

8.3. **Fees.** You agree to pay all fees, including the then-current subscription fee applicable to your Subscription Plan (“**Subscription Fee**”), and any applicable taxes for the use of the Service in the manner, currency, and on the dates specified at checkout when you purchase your Subscription Plan or in your Order Form with us, if applicable, and upon the renewal of your Subscription Plan. If you have a Multi-Seat Account, you agree that you will be charged for each seat that is enabled in your account at the price per seat shown at checkout when you purchase your Subscription Plan or in your Order Form. If additional seats are added to your Multi-Seat Account after your Subscription Period has started, you will be charged a pro-rated amount based on the remaining days of the then-current Subscription Period and, on the following Subscription Period, such additional seats will be charged in full. If seats are removed from your Multi-Seat Account after your Subscription Period has started, you will not receive any refunds for the then-current Subscription Period, but no charges will apply for the removed seats in the following Subscription Period. You further agree that we may charge a fee for each Digital Purchase (as defined below), subject to any additional rules or terms governing Paid Transfers (as defined below).

8.4. **Fees and Payment Terms Changes.** **We may update or change our fees (including, but not limited to, any Subscription Fee) and payment terms at any time at our sole discretion. Changes to fees will not apply retroactively and changes to Subscription Fee will become effective upon the renewal of your Subscription Plan.** We may offer and discontinue free trials, promotional subscription fees, or other offers at any time at our sole discretion, including on the basis of automated decision-making. Upon expiration of such offers, you will be charged the applicable Subscription Fee (if any).

8.5. **Taxes.** All fees are exclusive of taxes, unless otherwise specified by us. We will charge any applicable taxes in connection with the Service or any fees under these Terms as required by law. You may not withhold any taxes or charges or set off any amounts due to us. We reserve the right to withhold the payment of any amounts owed to you under these Terms and dispose of them as required by law, in each case as determined by us, or to seek later payment from you of any amounts on taxes uncollected and unremitted.

8.6. **Late or Non-Payment**. **If we do not receive your payment of the applicable Subscription Fee or other fees, we may, at our discretion, take one or more of the following actions: (a) revoke any credit terms or other payment accommodation which might have been previously afforded to you, (b) accelerate your entire account balance, (c) suspend or terminate your access to your account and to any portion or all of the Service in accordance with section 14, or (d) downgrade your Subscription Plan and charge you the Subscription Fee applicable to the downgraded Subscription Plan (if any),** without any responsibility for any loss of features, data, or functionality of the Service caused by such downgrading. If your payment of outstanding Subscription Fee or other fees fails as a result of insufficient funds in or other issues with your designated payment method, we may seek to recover the outstanding amount by, at our discretion, continuing to attempt to charge the outstanding amount to the same designated payment method, or dividing the outstanding amount into one or more smaller amounts and charging such smaller amounts to the same designated payment method, in which case we will use reasonable efforts to notify you.

8.7. **No Refunds.** Except as otherwise expressly stated in these Terms, all fees and taxes are non-refundable.

8.8. **Credit Card Payment Fee**. Payments with credit cards may be subject to an additional processing fee as specified in [Pricing](https://wetransfer.com/pricing) or at checkout.

13\. Indemnification
--------------------

You will defend, indemnify and hold us, our affiliates, our and our affiliates’ directors, officers, agents, employees, partners, licensors, contractors, permitted successors and permitted assigns (each of the foregoing, an “**Indemnitee**”) harmless from all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including, but not limited to, professional fees and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred by one or more Indemnitees, to the extent directly or indirectly arising out of or resulting from one or more of the following: (a) your or your Authorized Users access to or use of the Service; (b) your or your Authorized Users’ Feedback; (c) any breach of these Terms by you, your Authorized Users, or any person accessing the Service using your account or device; (d) your or your Authorized Users’ violation, misappropriation, or infringement of any rights of another (including intellectual property rights or privacy rights); (e) your or your Authorized Users’ violation of any applicable law or regulation; (f) any and all claims for property damage, personal injury or bodily injury or death, to the extent caused by your or your Authorized Users’ breach of these Terms; or (g) your or your Authorized Users’ conduct in connection with the Service.

You agree that we will have the right to control the defense, negotiation, and settlement of any claim subject to indemnification by you and that you will fully cooperate with us in the defense, negotiation, or settlement of any such claim, and that we will have the right to select counsel handling such defense, negotiation or settlement in our sole discretion. This section does not affect any other indemnities set out in a separate written agreement between you and us or the other Indemnitees.

14\. Suspension; Termination
----------------------------

14.1. **Suspension.** We may suspend without prior notice your access or your account (if any) and any portion or all of the Service for any reason, including if, in our sole judgment, we determine: (a) there is a threat or attack on any of our services or systems, or any data stored thereon; (b) your use of the Service disrupts or poses a security risk to us or any of our customers or vendors; (c) you are using the Service for purposes of engaging in, or your account is being used to engage in, fraudulent or illegal activities; (d) our provision of the Service to you is prohibited by applicable law; (e) you fail to comply with one or more provisions of these Terms, or we suspect that you are in violation of, or reasonably likely to be in violation of, one or more provisions of these Terms; or (f) any of our licensors or vendors restricts, suspends, or terminates our access to one or more Third-Party Service or Third-Party Materials that are required for the provision of or access to the Service.

15.2. **Jurisdiction.** If a dispute, claim or matter arising out of or in connection with these Terms is not subject to arbitration pursuant to section 16, you agree that any claim or dispute you may have against us must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in New York, New York, U.S., and you agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts located within New York, New York, U.S. (and, for the avoidance of doubt, to exclude the jurisdiction of any other court) for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.

16\. Dispute Resolution; Binding Individual Arbitration
-------------------------------------------------------

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU AND WETRANSFER TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU AND WETRANSFER CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM EACH OTHER. ARBITRATION PRECLUDES YOU AND WETRANSFER FROM SUING IN COURT OR HAVING A JURY TRIAL. YOU AND WETRANSFER AGREE THAT ARBITRATION WILL BE SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A CLASS ARBITRATION, CLASS ACTION, OR ANY OTHER KIND OF REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. WETRANSFER AND YOU ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY A JURY.**

**THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE TERMS IN THIS SECTION ARE INTENDED TO REDUCE THE FINANCIAL BURDENS ASSOCIATED WITH RESOLVING THEIR DISPUTES AND ARE NOT INTENDED TO DELAY ADJUDICATION OF ANY PARTY’S CLAIMS.**

**FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW IN SECTION 16(K) IF YOU WISH TO OPT OUT OF THE REQUIREMENT TO ARBITRATE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.**

**a) Claims Subject to this section.** The dispute resolution and binding arbitration terms in this section 16 apply to all Claims between you and WeTransfer. A “Claim” is any dispute, claim, cause of action, or controversy (excluding those exceptions listed below) between you and WeTransfer, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory for which either party wishes to seek legal recourse and that arises from or relates to these Terms or the Service, including any related to privacy or data-security or to the formation, validity, enforceability, revocability, performance, breach, or scope of these Terms or arbitration agreement or any portion of it or arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of these Terms or arbitration agreement. “Claim” also includes disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or prior versions of the Terms as well as claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms.

**b) Informal Dispute Resolution Prior to Arbitration**. If you have a Claim against WeTransfer or if WeTransfer has a Claim against you, you and WeTransfer must first attempt to resolve the Claim informally in order to try to resolve the Claim faster and reduce costs for both parties. You and WeTransfer will make a good-faith effort to negotiate the resolution of any Claim for 45 days, or such longer period as mutually agreed in writing (email suffices) by the parties, (“**Informal Resolution Period**”) from the day either party receives a written notice of a dispute from the other party (a “**Claimant Notice**”) in accordance with these Terms.

You will send any Claimant Notice to WeTransfer by certified mail addressed to Keizersgracht 281, 1016 ED, Amsterdam, the Netherlands or by email to legal@wetransfer.com. WeTransfer will send any Claimant Notice to you by certified mail or email using the contact information you have provided to WeTransfer or via reasonably available means of notice if you have not provided certified mail or email contact information to WeTransfer. The Claimant Notice sent by either party must (i) include the sender’s name, address, email address, telephone number, and any relevant purchase information; (ii) describe the nature and basis of the Claim; and (iii) set forth the specific relief sought.

The Informal Resolution Period is intended to allow the party who has received a Claimant Notice to make a fair, fact-based offer of settlement if it chooses to do so. You or WeTransfer cannot initiate arbitration before the end of the Informal Resolution Period. If you or WeTransfer file a Claim in court or initiate arbitration without first providing a compliant Claimant Notice and waiting until the conclusion of the Informal Resolution Period, the other party reserves the right to seek relief from a court or arbitrator to enjoin the filing or arbitration and seek damages from the party that has not followed the informal dispute-resolution process to reimburse it for any costs and fees—including arbitration, attorney, and expert fees—incurred as a foreseeable consequence of that breach.

The statute of limitations and any filing-fee deadlines for a Claim shall be tolled for the duration of the Informal Resolution Period for that Claim so that the parties can engage in this informal dispute-resolution process.

**c) Claims Subject to Binding Arbitration; Exceptions**. Except for individual disputes that qualify for small-claims court (provided that the small-claims court does not permit class or similar representative actions or relief) and any disputes exclusively related to the intellectual property or intellectual-property rights of you or WeTransfer, including any disputes in which you or WeTransfer seek injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use or infringement of your or WeTransfer’s intellectual property (“**IP Claims**”), all Claims, including Claims that are not related to intellectual property but are jointly filed with IP Claims, that are not resolved in accordance with section 16(b) will be resolved by a neutral arbitrator through final and binding arbitration instead of in a court by a judge or jury.

**d) Binding Individual Arbitration**. Subject to the terms of this section, Claims may only be adjudicated by binding individual arbitration conducted by National Arbitration and Mediation (“**NAM**”), [https://namadr.com](https://namadr.com/), according to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq., (“**FAA**”) and NAM’s Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures in effect at the time the Claim arose (“**Rules**”), as modified by these Terms.

These Terms affect interstate commerce, and the enforceability of this section 16 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the FAA to the extent permitted by law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms, and the Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Claim and to grant any remedy or relief that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, the arbitrator may only award legal or equitable remedies that are individual to you or WeTransfer to satisfy one of our individual Claims (that the arbitrator determines are supported by credible relevant evidence).

**e) Arbitration Procedure and Location.** You or WeTransfer may initiate arbitration of any Claim not resolved during the Informal Resolution Period by filing a demand for arbitration with NAM.

Instructions for filing a demand for arbitration with NAM are available on the NAM website or by emailing NAM at commercial@namadr.com. You will send a copy of any demand for arbitration to WeTransfer by certified mail addressed to Keizersgracht 281, 1016 ED, Amsterdam, the Netherlands or by email to legal@wetransfer.com. WeTransfer will send any demand for arbitration to you by certified mail or email using the contact information you have provided to WeTransfer or via reasonably available means of notice if you have not provided certified mail or email contact information to WeTransfer.

The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator in the English language. You and WeTransfer both agree that the arbitrator will be bound by these Terms.

For Claims in which the claimant seeks USD 10,000 or less, the arbitrator will decide the matter solely based on written submissions, without a formal hearing, unless the arbitrator decides that a formal hearing is necessary. For Claims in which the claimant seeks more than USD 10,000, or smaller matters in which the arbitrator determines a hearing to be necessary, hearings shall be conducted by video or telephone, unless the arbitrator determines an in-person hearing is necessary. If an in-person hearing is required and you reside in the United States, the hearing will take place in New York, New York, unless you are a consumer and the arbitrator determines that this would pose a hardship for you, in which case the in-person hearing may be conducted in the claimant’s state and county of residence. If you reside outside the United States, the site of any in-person hearing will be determined by the applicable Rules.

The arbitrator (not a judge or jury) will resolve all Claims in arbitration. Unless you and WeTransfer agree otherwise, any decision or award will include a written statement stating the decision of each Claim and the basis for the award, including the arbitrator’s essential factual and legal findings and conclusions.

An arbitration award and any judgment confirming it apply only to that specific case; they cannot be used or offered as precedent in any other case except to enforce the award itself unless the parties agree prior to issuance of the award. Any arbitration decision or award may be enforced as a final judgment by any court of competent jurisdiction or, if applicable, application may be made to such court for judicial confirmation of any award and an order of enforcement.

**f) Arbitration Fees**. Except for circumstances outlined in section 16(g), each party will be responsible for arbitration fees in accordance with the applicable Rules and these Terms.

**g) Frivolous or Improper Claims**. To the extent permitted by applicable law, a claimant must pay all costs and fees incurred by the defending party—including arbitration, attorney, and expert fees—related to a Claim if an arbitrator determines that (i) the Claim was frivolous or (ii) the Claim was filed for any improper purpose, such as to harass the responding party, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution.

**h) One Year to Assert Claims. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY CLAIM BY YOU OR WETRANSFER AGAINST THE OTHER MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM ARISES; OTHERWISE, THE CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU OR WETRANSFER WILL NO LONGER HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASSERT THAT CLAIM.**

**i) Confidentiality**. If you or WeTransfer submits a Claim to arbitration, you and WeTransfer agree to cooperate to seek from the arbitrator protection for any confidential, proprietary, trade secret, or otherwise sensitive information, documents, testimony, and other materials that might be exchanged or the subject of discovery in the arbitration. You and WeTransfer agree to seek such protection before any such information, documents, testimony, or materials are exchanged or otherwise become the subject of discovery in the arbitration.

**j) Coordinated Filings**. If 25 or more Claimant Notices are received by a party that raise similar claims and have the same or coordinated counsel, these will be considered “Coordinated Claims” and will be treated as mass filings, mass arbitrations or multiple case filings according to the Rules, if and to the extent Coordinated Claims are filed in arbitration as set forth in these Terms. You or WeTransfer may advise the other of your or its belief that Claims are Coordinated Claims, and disputes over whether a Claim meets the definition of “Coordinated Claims” will be decided by the arbitration provider as an administrative matter. The following procedures are intended to supplement the Rules, and to the extent the procedures conflict with those Rules, to supersede them.

**COORDINATED CLAIMS MAY ONLY BE FILED IN ARBITRATION AS PERMITTED BY THE BELLWETHER PROCESS SET FORTH BELOW. APPLICABLE STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS WILL BE TOLLED FOR CLAIMS ASSERTED AS COORDINATED CLAIMS FROM THE TIME A COMPLIANT CLAIMANT NOTICE HAS BEEN RECEIVED BY A PARTY UNTIL THESE TERMS PERMIT SUCH COORDINATED CLAIMS TO BE FILED IN ARBITRATION OR COURT.**

Initial Bellwether: The bellwether process set forth in this section will not proceed until counsel representing the Coordinated Claims has advised the other party in writing (email suffices) that all or substantially all the Claimant Notices for the Coordinated Claims have been provided.

After that point, counsel for the parties shall select 20 Coordinated Claims to proceed in arbitration as a bellwether to allow each side to test the merits of its claims and arguments. Each side shall select 10 claimants who have provided compliant Claimant Notices for this purpose, and only those chosen cases may be filed with the arbitration provider. The parties acknowledge that resolution of some Coordinated Claims will be delayed by this bellwether process. Any remaining Coordinated Claims shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those Claims, unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as set out in this section 16(j).

A single arbitrator shall preside over each Coordinated Claim chosen for a bellwether proceeding, and only one Coordinated Claim may be assigned to each arbitrator as part of a bellwether process unless the parties agree otherwise.

Mediation: Once the arbitrations that are part of the bellwether process have concluded (or sooner if the claimants and the other party agree), counsel for the parties must engage in a single mediation of all remaining Coordinated Claims, with the mediator’s fee paid for by WeTransfer. Counsel for the claimants and the other party must agree on a mediator within thirty (30) days after the conclusion of the last bellwether arbitration. If counsel for the claimants and the other party cannot agree on a mediator within 30 days, the arbitration provider will appoint a mediator as an administrative matter. All parties will cooperate for the purpose of ensuring that the mediation is scheduled as quickly as practicable after the mediator is appointed.

Remaining Claims: If the mediation does not yield a global resolution of all remaining Coordinated Claims, the arbitration requirement in this section 16 shall no longer apply to Coordinated Claims for which a compliant Claimant Notice was received by the other party but that were not resolved in the bellwether proceedings. Such Coordinated Claims released from the arbitration requirement must be resolved in accordance with section 15.2.

To the extent you are asserting the same Claim as other persons and are represented by common or coordinated counsel, you agree to waive any objection that the joinder of all such persons is impracticable.

If Coordinated Claims released from the arbitration requirement are brought in court, claimants may seek class treatment, but to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, the classes sought may comprise only the claimants in Coordinated Claims for which a compliant Claimant Notice was received by the other party. Any party may contest class certification at any stage of the litigation and on any available basis.

A court shall have authority to enforce the bellwether and mediation processes defined in this section 16(j) and may enjoin the filing of lawsuits or arbitration demands not made in compliance with it.

**k) Opting Out of Arbitration**. You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accept these Terms by providing us with notice of your decision to opt out via email at legal@wetransfer.com or by certified mail addressed to Keizersgracht 281, 1016 ED, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. To be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name, mailing address, and email address. The notice must also clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve disputes in accordance with section 15.2. If you opt out of this updated arbitration clause and were previously subject to an arbitration clause in effect prior to this updated arbitration clause, then that prior arbitration clause will remain as part of the agreement between us. If you are a new user and did not previously consent to the prior arbitration clause and you choose to opt-out of this updated agreement, then we will also not be bound by this updated arbitration clause. Changes to this section 16 do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the binding arbitration if you have previously agreed to a version of these Terms and did not validly opt out of binding arbitration.

**l) Rejection of Future Arbitration Changes**. You may reject any change we make to section 16 (except address changes) by sending us notice of your rejection within 30 days of the change via email at legal@wetransfer.com or by certified mail addressed to Keizersgracht 281, 1016 ED, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Changes to section 16 may only be rejected as a whole, and you may not reject only certain changes to section 16. If you reject changes made to section 16, the most recent version of section 16 that you have not rejected will continue to apply.

**m) Severability**. If any portion of this section 16 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, including but not limited to because it is found to be unconscionable, (i) the unenforceable or unlawful provision will be severed from these Terms; (ii) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision will have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this section 16 or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this section 16; and (iii) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, in accordance with these Terms, and not in arbitration. The litigation of those claims will be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this section 16 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief whose primary purpose and effect is to prohibit and enjoin conduct harmful to the general public), that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this section 16 will be enforceable. To the extent that you prevail on a Claim and seek public injunctive relief, the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual Claims in arbitration.

17\. General
------------

17.1. **Assignment.** You will not assign, subcontract, delegate, or otherwise transfer these Terms, or your rights and obligations hereunder, without obtaining the prior written consent of one of our authorized representatives, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be void. We may assign these Terms or delegate our obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, without your consent, to any person or entity at any time. These Terms will be binding upon the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

17.2. **Severability.** If any provision or part of these Terms is found to be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, that provision, or the affected part thereof, will be deemed amended so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Any invalid or unenforceable portion should be construed as narrowly as possible in order to give effect to as much of these Terms as possible. Any unaffected provision of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.

17.3. **No Waiver.** Any failure by us to exercise or enforce any of our rights under these Terms does not waive our right to enforce such rights.

17.4. **No Third-Party Beneficiaries.** Except as expressly provided in sections 9 (**Our Intellectual Property Rights**), 11 (**Third-Party Materials and Services; Advertising**), 13 (**Indemnification**), 17 (**General**), and 19 (**Additional Terms for App Marketplaces**), there are no third-party beneficiaries to these Terms other than each of our affiliates.

1\. Introduction

4\. Your Account
----------------

4.1. **Account Information**. Although these Terms apply regardless of whether you create or use an account, the use of certain features of the Service may require you to have an account. In such cases, these Terms also govern your account. You must provide only true, current and accurate information when you create your account or provide us with the required information, and meet the eligibility requirements under these Terms and [Pricing](https://wetransfer.com/pricing). You agree to update your registration information to keep it accurate and current. We may ask you to confirm your registration information (such as your email address) to continue using the Service. If you choose not to do so, your access to the Service may be restricted or terminated. When you choose a username or otherwise create a nickname, you agree not to use any name that is unlawful, fraudulent, deceptive, harmful, defamatory, inaccurate, abusive, offensive, threatening, hateful, violent, harassing, discriminatory or racist, or any name that infringes or violates another person’s rights (including, but not limited to, intellectual property rights, and rights of privacy and publicity). You agree not to impersonate any person or misrepresent your identity or affiliation with any person. You further agree not to purchase, sell, rent, or give away your account, or share your registration information. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, you are responsible for anything that happens through your account and all uses of your registration information, including, but not limited to, purchases, whether or not authorized by you.

4.2. **Account Security**. In the event you become aware of or reasonably suspect any breach of security, including any loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure, of your registration information, you must immediately notify us and modify your registration information. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and the confidentiality of your registration information. If required, you must use a strong password for your account that is unique to the Service and not used by you in any other service.

4.3. **Multi-Seat Account**. If your Subscription Plan permits it, you may enable more than one individual user to access and use the Service (“**Authorized Users**”) under your account (“**Multi-Seat Account**”) during the Subscription Period (as defined below), subject to the number of seats and other conditions as specified in [Pricing](https://wetransfer.com/pricing) or in the order form through which you purchased your Subscription Plan (“**Order Form**”). Each seat on a Multi-Seat Account may only be used by one Authorized User. Subject to the terms of the applicable Subscription Plan, a Multi-Seat Account may allow you to, or require that you, enable one or more administrators (“**Account Administrators**”) to manage, access, and use the account and any associated Content (as defined below), and to enable or remove Authorized Users. We may provide you with instructions on how to enable access to the Multi-Seat Account by the Authorized Users, which may include, without limitation, the provision of a private link to access our account creation portal for the Service. If you purchase a Subscription Plan for a Multi-Seat Account as a legal entity in connection with your business, you may assign seats to your employees or those of your affiliates, who will be considered your Authorized Users. In this case, seats on your Multi-Seat Account may only be used for activities related to your business or that of your affiliates. If an employee leaves your or your affiliate’s organization, you must notify us with the account details associated with the relevant seat, and we will then disable that seat. Once disabled, it may be reassigned to a new employee, provided that the new Authorized User completes the onboarding process and a new account is created. Any subscriptions acquired by Authorized Users outside the onboarding method we provide will not be considered part of your Multi-Seat Account and may incur separate billing. You agree that we are not responsible for the use of your Multi-Seat Account or the Service by your Authorized Users, and you are responsible for ensuring that they comply with the Terms. You are also solely responsible for implementing any measures you deem reasonably necessary to safeguard your proprietary or confidential information. We may monitor and enforce Subscription Plan limitations and restrictions, including, but not limited to, the right to charge for overages.

4.4. **Inactive Account**. We will consider your account as inactive if you have not accessed your account for 12 months and you do not have an active paid Subscription Plan. You are responsible for keeping your account active. We may delete or close your account if it becomes inactive.

4.5. **Device**. If you use or access the Service with any mobile phone, tablet, laptop, desktop computer or other device not owned by you, you must have the device owner’s permission to do so. You will be responsible for complying with these Terms, whether or not you own the device.

We are not responsible for any disruption or loss that you may suffer as a result of any unavailability of the Service in accordance with this section.

5.3. **Trials and Betas.** We may offer optional access to features on a free, trial, beta, or early access basis (“T**rials and Betas**”) and we may perform other product validations techniques.

Some features may allow you to restrict access to your Content with a password, and you are responsible for the confidentiality and your sharing of such passwords and password-protected Content. Your Content will be available to you to export or download depending on your Subscription Plan and only during the period specified under the terms of the applicable feature or your Subscription Plan, after which we have no obligation to maintain, and we may delete your Content from the Service. We may also delete your Content if your account is inactive in accordance with section 4.4. This section does not affect section 12.

8\. Subscription Plan and Automatic Renewals; Fees and Payments
---------------------------------------------------------------

8.1. **Subscription Plan.** One or more features of the Service may require a subscription plan (“**Subscription Plan**”) which may automatically renew. The license period for the applicable Subscription Plan (“**Subscription Period**”) may vary, for example, with weekly, monthly or annual terms as specified at checkout when you purchase your Subscription Plan or in your Order Form. Each Subscription Plan may have one or more eligibility requirements and authorized uses as set out in [Pricing](https://wetransfer.com/pricing). **Upon expiration of the Subscription Period, your Subscription Plan will automatically renew for recurring Subscription Periods of the same duration,** unless the Subscription Plan is canceled or not renewed in accordance with these Terms. **If you purchase a Subscription Plan other than through an Order Form, (a) you authorize us to charge the applicable Subscription Fee to your designated payment method for your initial Subscription Period and automatically upon each renewal with no further action required by you**, and (b) you must keep your payment method up to date in your account settings or by contacting us via our [Help Center](https://help.wetransfer.com/hc/en-us).

8.2. **Non-Renewal.** **If you purchase your Subscription Plan through one of the Sites, you can manage and cancel your subscription and any automatic renewals at any time from your account settings. If you purchase your Subscription Plan through an App, you can cancel your subscription and automatic renewals at any time in your account settings with the App Marketplace according to the policies of each App Marketplace. Uninstalling an App will not result in the cancellation of your subscription. If you purchase your Subscription Plan through an Order Form, you can cancel your subscription and any automatic renewals by providing written notice of termination to the contacts specified in your Order Form, at least one month before the end of the then-current Subscription Period.** We may elect to not renew a Subscription Plan by providing notice to you before the end of the then-current Subscription Period. If you have begun a Subscription Period and you then decide to cancel your subscription during such period, you will not receive a refund for the fees you already paid for such Subscription Period, and you will continue to be able to use the Service for which you subscribed until the end of such Subscription Period. The expiration of the Subscription Plan due to any non-renewal will be effective as of the end of the then-current Subscription Period. Unused add-ons, features, seats, or any other items of your Subscription Plan will not be reimbursed and do not rollover to any subsequent Subscription Period or renewal term, if applicable. You can downgrade your Subscription Plan or reduce your add-ons, features, or seats in your account, but such downgrades will not become effective until the end of your current Subscription Period, and you will not receive a refund or credit for such downgrade or reductions. Downgrading your Subscription Plan may cause loss of features, seats, data, or functionality of the Service available to you, and we will not be responsible for any such loss.

8.3. **Fees.** You agree to pay all fees, including the then-current subscription fee applicable to your Subscription Plan (“**Subscription Fee**”), and any applicable VAT or other taxes for the use of the Service in the manner, currency, and on the dates specified at checkout when you purchase your Subscription Plan or in your Order Form with us, if applicable, and upon the renewal of your Subscription Plan. If you have a Multi-Seat Account, you agree that you will be charged for each seat that is enabled in your account at the price per seat shown at checkout when you purchase your Subscription Plan or in your Order Form. If additional seats are added to your Multi-Seat Account after your Subscription Period has started, you will be charged a pro-rated amount based on the remaining days of the then-current Subscription Period and, on the following Subscription Period, such additional seats will be charged in full. If seats are removed from your Multi-Seat Account after your Subscription Period has started, you will not receive any refunds for the then-current Subscription Period, but no charges will apply for the removed seats in the following Subscription Period. You further agree that we may charge a fee for each Digital Purchase (as defined below), subject to any additional rules or terms governing Paid Transfers (as defined below).

8.4. **Fees and Payment Terms** **Changes.** We may update or change our fees (including, but not limited to, any Subscription Fee) and payment terms from time to time to reflect circumstances such as changes to the Service (including the addition of new features), changes in our business, changes in legal, regulatory, or contractual requirements, changes to the economic environment we operate in, or other justifiable or business reasons. In such cases, we will notify you in advance via email or a pop-up or push notification within the Service. Changes to fees will not apply retroactively and changes to Subscription Fee will become effective upon the renewal of your Subscription Plan. If you are a consumer resident in the European Economic Area and do not agree with the new fees or payment terms, you will have the statutory right to cancel your Subscription Plan and withdraw from these Terms free of charge before the new fees or payment terms become effective by following the instructions on section 8.2 above. We may offer and discontinue free trials, promotional subscription fees, or other offers at any time at our sole discretion, including on the basis of automated decision-making. Upon expiration of such offers, you will be charged the applicable Subscription Fee (if any).

8.5. **Taxes.** All fees are exclusive of any applicable VAT or other taxes, unless otherwise specified by us. We will charge any applicable taxes in connection with the Service or any fees under these Terms as required by law. You may not withhold any taxes or charges or set off any amounts due to us. We reserve the right to withhold the payment of any amounts owed to you under these Terms and dispose of them as required by law, in each case as determined by us, or to seek later payment from you of any amounts on taxes uncollected and unremitted.

8.6. **Late or Non-Payment. If we do not receive your payment of the applicable Subscription Fee or other fees, we may, at our discretion, take one or more of the following actions: (a) revoke any credit terms or other payment accommodation which might have been previously afforded to you, (b) accelerate your entire account balance, (c) suspend or terminate your access to your account and to any portion or all of the Service in accordance with section 14, or (d) downgrade your Subscription Plan and charge you the Subscription Fee applicable to the downgraded Subscription Plan (if any),** without any responsibility for any loss of features, data, or functionality of the Service caused by such downgrading. If your payment of outstanding Subscription Fee or other fees fails as a result of insufficient funds in or other issues with your designated payment method, we may seek to recover the outstanding amount by, at our discretion, continuing to attempt to charge the outstanding amount to the same designated payment method, or dividing the outstanding amount into one or more smaller amounts and charging such smaller amounts to the same designated payment method, in which case we will use reasonable efforts to notify you.

8.7. **No Refunds.** Except as otherwise expressly stated in these Terms, all fees and taxes are non-refundable.

8.8. **Credit Card Payment Fee**. Payments with credit cards may be subject to an additional processing fee as specified in [Pricing](https://wetransfer.com/pricing) or at checkout.

No oral or written information or advice given by us or our authorized representatives will create a warranty.

If (1) you are a Seller, (2) your place of establishment or residence is in the European Union, and (3) you offer Content to consumers located in the EU through the Service as part of your business activity, you are deemed a “Business User” (as this term is defined in the P2B Regulation) and the Additional Terms for EU Sellers are in addition to the Terms and apply to you, in accordance with the P2B Regulation. If this section 17.3 conflicts with the other provisions of the Terms, this section will prevail.

17.3.2. **Access to Information and Data**. A Business User has access to and control over its Content and data in accordance with the Terms. We have access to and retain (including following the termination of the Terms) the data collected through the Service, including personal data and any other data provided by WeTransfer’s users, Buyers, and Sellers, including Business Users in accordance with our [Privacy & Cookie Policy](https://wetransfer.com/explore/legal/privacy) and, where applicable, the Data Processing Agreement.

17.3.5. **Changes**. We may update the Terms from time to time as we remove or release new features, technologies, or services, or to comply with legal, regulatory, or contractual requirements, in response to exceptional or unforeseen circumstances, or for other justifiable or business reasons. In such cases, we will provide the Business User with reasonable notice, with a minimum notice period of 15 days. During this notice period, the Business User may terminate its Subscription Plan due to the proposed changes. The proposed changes to the Terms will not take effect until the notice period has expired. This 15-day notice period does not apply if (i) we change the Terms on the basis of a legal or regulatory obligation, or in order to address an unforeseen and imminent danger relating to defending WeTransfer’s business, or (ii) the Business User waives the notice period, either explicitly or implicitly by continuing to use Paid Transfers during the notice period. In such a scenario, the amended Terms will take effect immediately after notification and publication. We will not impose any retroactive changes to the Terms, except when the changes are required to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation or when the retroactive changes are beneficial to the Business User.
