Responsible Disclosure Policy
=============================

At WeTransfer, we consider the security of our systems - and our users - a top priority. But no matter how much effort we put into system security, there can still be vulnerabilities present. If you discover a vulnerability, we would like to know about it so we can take steps to address it as quickly as possible. Submit your findings by using our [Responsible Disclosure Form](https://hackerone.com/d8ebd2aa-9ed5-4063-a755-acaf9c662856/embedded_submissions/new?locale=en) hosted by HackerOne.

### Scope

The following areas are considered **out of scope**:

* [Paste](https://pasteapp.com/), both the web and mobile applications
    

* [Collect](https://collect.wetransfer.com/), both the web and mobile applications
    

* [Paper](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id506003812?pt=658364)
    

* Vulnerabilities that require access to an already compromised account (unless access to an account exposes _other_ accounts)
    

* Policies as opposed to implementations - email verification, password length, or reuse, etc.
    

* Ability to upload or download malicious files via wetransfer.com
    

* Users hosting malware on our service (contact support for this)
    

* Spam (unless a specific vulnerability leads to easily sending spam)
    

* Authentication (or lack thereof) on free transfers
    

* Missing security headers or 'best practices' (except if you are able to demonstrate a vulnerability that makes use of their absence)
    

* Vulnerabilities in our open source software (unless you have a proof of concept of how the specific vulnerability can be used on wetransfer.com or related apps).
    

* Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDoS)
    

* Social engineering attacks
    

* Third party applications we make use of, but do not control. (e.g., a blog hosted on an external service - unless we've configured the blog in such a way as to make our in-scope areas vulnerable)
    

* Integrations and extensions created by third-party developers using our public API
    

* Non-production environments across our product line
    

The following areas are considered **in scope**:

* The [wetransfer.com](https://wetransfer.com/) web application
    

* The [Portals](https://portals.wetransfer.com/) web application
    

* [WePresent](https://wepresent.wetransfer.com/)
    

* The [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wetransfer-send-large-files/id1569379048) and Android WeTransfer applications
    

Ideally, a reported vulnerability will be achievable without physical access to a target's device. 

In addition, while we welcome disclosure reports from automated tools/scans, we cannot offer a reward.  
  
  
  
  
  

### What we ask of you

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in a WeTransfer service, please do the following:

* Submit your findings by using our [Responsible Disclosure Form](https://hackerone.com/d8ebd2aa-9ed5-4063-a755-acaf9c662856/embedded_submissions/new?locale=en) hosted by HackerOne.
    

* Do not take advantage of the vulnerability or problem you have discovered, for example, by downloading more data than necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability or deleting or modifying other people's data. This is critically important, so let us emphasise it: _do not interact with the data in question more than is necessary to notify us._
    

* Do not reveal the problem to others until it has been resolved.
    

* Do not use attacks on physical security, social engineering, distributed denial of service (or any attack using large volumes of requests), spam, or applications of third parties.
    

* Please provide sufficient information to reproduce the problem so we can resolve it as quickly as possible. Usually, the IP address or URL of the affected system and a description of the vulnerability will be sufficient, but complex vulnerabilities may require further explanation.  
      
      
      
      
      
    

### What we promise

* We thank you for your help in making WeTransfer more secure.
    

* We will respond to an accepted report within 5 business days with our evaluation of the report.
    

* If you have followed the instructions above, we will not take any legal action against you in regard to the report or pass on your personal details to third parties without your permission.
    

* We will keep you informed of the progress towards resolving the problem.
    

* In the public information concerning the problem reported, we will give your name as the discoverer of the problem (unless you desire otherwise).  
      
      
      
      
      
    

### Recognition and remuneration

For accepted reports we may provide a financial reward. This reward will be based on the quality of the disclosure and nature of the vulnerability. Rewards are granted entirely at our discretion, and may be reduced or declined if there is evidence of abuse.
