6.  Some Submissions may contain information about products not manufactured by Apple or links to independent websites not controlled or tested by Apple. Information about non-Apple Products or links to non-Apple websites are provided without recommendation or endorsement by Apple. Apple assumes no responsibility with regard to the selection, performance, or use of third-party websites or products.

8.  Apple may offer certain benefits and privileges for your participation in the Site. The benefits and privileges provided do not create an employee, agency or independent contractor relationship between you and Apple, and you may not present yourself as a spokesperson for Apple.
9.  Apple may use cookies and other technologies within Apple Support Communities. Such cookies enable us to maintain your session and to personalize your experience on the site, help us measure the effectiveness of the site, and improve user experience.

***   Submissions**

1.  Stay on topic. Apple Support Communities is here to help people use Apple products and technologies more effectively. Unless otherwise noted, do not post Submissions about non-technical topics, including:

1.  Speculation or rumors about unannounced products.
2.  Discussion of Apple policies or procedures or Apple’s moderation of the Site.

3.  Be polite. Everyone should feel comfortable reading Submissions and participating in discussions. Submissions that are inflammatory or inappropriate will be edited or removed. This includes Submissions with content that is libelous, defamatory, indecent, harmful, harassing, intimidating, threatening, hateful, objectionable, discriminatory, politically divisive or inflammatory, abusive, vulgar, obscene, pornographic, sexually explicit, or offensive in a sexual, racial, cultural, or ethnic context.
4.  Post constructive comments and questions. Unless otherwise noted, your Submission should either be a technical support question or a technical support answer. Constructive feedback about product features is also welcome.
5.  Do not post polls or petitions or links to the same.
6.  Test your answer. When answering a technical question, if possible, make sure your Submission works on your own Apple device before you post it.
7.  No advertising. Do not use the Site to sell or market products or services to others and do not post a URL unless it directly answers a user’s question. For the avoidance of doubt, the following are not permitted on the Site:

1.  A Submission created solely to advertise a book, service, software or another item or product for sale.
2.  Any reference, including a link, to a commercial product or service that is not directly related to a relevant technical support question or answer. For example: "This post created by Super Post Creator."
3.  Links to personal or professional websites or any link that results in any accrual of compensation or benefit to you. However, you may sign your Submissions with information about yourself. An example of an acceptable signature: Justine R., Author, "Apple Lisa Communities: Tips and Tricks"

9.  No inappropriate or offensive user names ("Aliases") or impersonations. Inappropriate or offensive Aliases will be removed, and persons attempting to impersonate another person will have their Submissions removed or may have their account deactivated. Aliases may not contain website, email addresses or other contact information.
10.  Keep within the law.

1.  No content may be submitted that is intended to promote or commit an illegal act.
2.  Do not submit software or descriptions of processes that break or otherwise ‘work around’ digital rights management software or hardware. This includes conversations about ‘ripping’ DVDs or working around digital rights management software used on Apple Music or other media sources.
3.  Do not post defamatory material.

12.  Material submitted must be your own work or work to which you have a license. By posting a Submission, you warrant and represent that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the information contained in your Submission.
13.  License to Use Submission. By posting a Submission, you agree to grant Apple a perpetual, royalty-free, non-exclusive worldwide right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform, play, make available to the public, and exercise all copyright and publicity rights with respect to the Submission. If you do not want to grant Apple the rights set out above, do not send your Submission to the Site.
14.  Never reveal any personal information.

***   Minors**

1.  You must be at least 13 years old (or the equivalent minimum age in your region) to make a Submission to the Site. If you are over 13 years old (or the equivalent minimum age in your region) but have not yet reached the age of majority, you must have your parent’s or guardian’s permission to make a Submission to the Site.

***   Interference with the Site**

1.  You agree to not interfere with or disrupt the Site.
