Our Commitment to\
Human Rights
“At Apple, we are optimistic about technology’s awesome potential for
good. But we know that it won’t happen on its own. Every day, we\
work to infuse the devices we make with the humanity that makes us.”
—Tim Cook
People Come First
At Apple, our respect for human rights begins with our commitment to treating everyone
with dignity and respect. But it doesn’t end there.
We believe in the power of technology to empower and connect people around the world—
and that business can and should be a force for good. Achieving that takes innovation, hard
work, and a focus on serving others.
It also means leading with our values. Our human rights policy governs how we treat
everyone—from our customers and teams to our business partners and people at every
level of our supply chain.\
With humility, optimism, and an abiding faith in people, we’re committed to respecting the
human rights of everyone whose lives we touch.
Our Commitment to Human Rights
We’re deeply committed to continually assessing our progress and building the lessons\
we learn into everything we do. We’ve worked hard to embed a respect for human rights
across our company—in the technology we make, in the way we make it, and in how we
treat people.
The Technology We Make
As a global technology company, we feel a deep sense of responsibility to make technology
for people that respects their human rights, empowers them with useful tools and
information, and enhances their overall quality of life.\
We do that with our uncompromising commitment to security and user privacy—setting\
the industry standard for minimizing personal data collection. We build privacy protections
into everything we make—from products like iPhone, to services like Apple Pay, to our
comprehensive review process for every app on the App Store.

Hand in hand with the privacy of our users is our commitment to freedom of information
and expression. Our products help our customers communicate, learn, express their
creativity, and exercise their ingenuity. We believe in the critical importance of an open
society in which information flows freely, and we’re convinced the best way we can
continue to promote openness is to remain engaged, even where we may disagree with a
country’s laws.
We act responsibly when it comes to the content on our platforms, and with services like
Apple News, we make it easy for our users to find timely information from the most trusted
sources. Across all our services, including the App Store, Apple Podcasts, and others, users
can choose from a wide variety of options, and we carefully review the content on every
Apple app and service against our guidelines and standards.
We work every day to make quality products, including content and services, available\
to our users in a way that respects their human rights. We’re required to comply with\
local laws, and at times there are complex issues about which we may disagree with
governments and other stakeholders on the right path forward. With dialogue, and a belief
in the power of engagement, we try to find the solution that best serves our users—their
privacy, their ability to express themselves, and their access to reliable information and
helpful technology.
Finally, when it comes to making technology that empowers and connects people,\
we’ve always believed in creating the most accessible products and services in the\
world—because technology made for everyone should meet everyone’s needs.
The Way We Make It
Respect for human rights shapes how we make our products and services. Our
responsibilities go beyond our stores and corporate offices: They extend to our\
supply chain, the communities we’re a part of, and the planet we all share.
Across our supply chain, we work hand in hand with our suppliers to ensure that every
workplace provides a safe and respectful environment for everyone. We do that through
mandatory trainings on labor and human rights, regular and independent audits, and an
anonymous reporting system in which we investigate every complaint. If a company is\
not willing or able to meet our high standards, we will no longer do business with them.
We want to be a force for good in the lives of people in our supply chain and their
communities. We’re proud to work with our neighbors and suppliers to develop new skill
sets, start businesses, and advocate for change. In addition to our global educational
initiatives, we’ve partnered with local activists and international human rights nonprofits.
An essential part of our impact on humanity is our effort to protect the planet—in how we
design, build, and recycle our products.\
We run Apple on 100 percent renewable energy, and we’re working with our suppliers to
make the same transition. Every day, we’re making progress on our goal of reaching a
closed-loop supply chain that uses only recycled and renewable content. And we’ve put
our innovation and expertise to the task of conserving water, making robots that recycle
and recover precious materials, and sharing our road map for the future to inspire our
industry peers to join us on our environmental journey.

How We Treat People
We’ve always said Apple’s soul is our people. That’s why we’re committed to respecting\
the human rights of everyone whose lives we touch—including our employees, suppliers,
contractors, and customers.
At Apple and throughout our supply chain, we prohibit harassment, discrimination,
violence, and retaliation of any kind—and we have zero tolerance for violations motivated
by any form of prejudice or bigotry. We require our employees to be trained annually\
on Apple’s  Business Conduct Policy , which reflects our commitment to respect human
rights and to conduct business ethically, honestly, and in compliance with applicable laws
and regulations.
We’re also deeply committed to the essential work of improving diversity, increasing
inclusion, and advancing racial justice—both within our company and through efforts like
our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, which is focused on education, economic equality,
and criminal justice reform. Our efforts here are motivated by a strong desire to create a
welcoming and supportive environment for all our teams and to help combat discrimination,
injustice, and systemic racism. We require every Apple employee to participate in trainings
on unconscious bias, and we’re working to improve representation and diversity in
positions of leadership and at every level of our company.
Our Commitment to International Human Rights
Standards
We’re deeply committed to respecting internationally recognized human rights in our
business operations, as set out in the United Nations International Bill of Human Rights\
and the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and
Rights at Work. Our approach is based on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and
Human Rights. We conduct human rights due diligence to identify risks and work to
mitigate them. We seek to remedy adverse impacts, track and measure our progress,\
and report our findings.\
We believe that dialogue and engagement are the best ways to work toward building a better
world. In keeping with the UN Guiding Principles, where national law and international h uman
rights standards differ, we follow the higher standard. Where they are in conflict, we
respect national law while seeking to respect the principles of internationally recognized
human rights.

Transparency and Communication
We want everyone—from our customers to our industry peers—to know about our\
values and the progress we’re making for people and the planet.
We track and measure our performance across a range of areas, and we apply the\
lessons we learn to continually improve. We report our performance publicly in\
several ways, including in our Transparency, Supplier Responsibility, Modern Slavery,
and Conflict Minerals reports, available on our Apple Values pages  here .\
To make sure our progress is as meaningful and impactful as possible, we work with\
a broad range of groups—including workers’ rights advocates and local leaders—
and consult with stakeholders that include United Nations bodies, governments,
nongovernmental organizations, and the world’s leading human rights and labor experts.
Our Board of Directors has adopted this policy on behalf of Apple and is responsible\
for overseeing and periodically reviewing the policy. Apple’s Senior Vice President and
General Counsel oversees the implementation of our policy and reports to the Board\
and its committees on our progress and significant issues.\
We always strive to be an example for others to follow, and to share our progress to
accelerate industrywide change. But we also know our work will never be finished—
because we believe that if we aren’t finding ways to improve, we aren’t looking hard
enough.
