Human Rights Policy May 2025



Our Commitment to

Human Rights



“Whether we’re protecting the right to privacy, designing technology that is

accessible to all, or using more recycled material in our products than ever, we are

always working to make a difference for the people we serve and the planet we

share.”



—Tim Cook



People Come First



At Apple, our respect for human rights begins with our commitment to treating everyone with dignity and

respect. But it doesn’t end there.



We believe in the power of technology to empower and connect people around the world—and that business

can and should be a force for good. Achieving that takes innovation, hard work, and a focus on serving

others.



It also means leading with our values. Our human rights policy governs how we treat everyone—from our

customers and teams, to our business partners and communities, and to people at every level of our supply

chain.



Our Commitment to International Human Rights Standards



We’re deeply committed to respecting internationally recognized human rights in our business operations, as

set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,

and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (together, the “International Bill of

Human Rights”) and the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and

Rights at Work. Our approach is based on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.



Everywhere we operate, we seek to conduct business in compliance with applicable laws and in accordance

with our commitment to respect internationally recognized human rights. When faced with conflicting

requirements, in keeping with the UN Guiding Principles, we seek to comply with applicable law and also seek

ways to honor our commitment to respect principles of internationally recognized human rights.



We conduct robust due diligence to identify salient human rights risks through risk assessments and through

channels we maintain with stakeholders, including workers in our supply chain, civil rights groups, human

rights and labor experts, investors, governments, and United Nations bodies. We work to mitigate these risks,

and we seek to remedy adverse impacts, track and measure our progress, and report our findings.

Embedding Respect for Human Rights



We’ve embedded a respect for human rights across our company—in the technology we make, in the way we

make it, and in how we treat people. We're deeply committed to continually assessing our progress and

building the lessons we learn into everything we do.



The Technology We Make

As a global technology company, we operationalize our sense of responsibility to make technology for people

that respects their human rights, empowers them with useful tools and information, and enhances their

overall quality of life.



We do that with our uncompromising commitment to security and user privacy—setting the industry standard

for minimizing personal data collection. We build privacy protections into everything we make—from products

like iPhone, to services like Apple Pay, to our comprehensive review process for every app on the App Store.



Hand in hand with the privacy of our users is our commitment to freedom of information and expression. Our

products help our customers communicate, learn, express their creativity, and exercise their ingenuity. We

believe in the critical importance of an open society in which information flows freely, and we’re convinced the

best way we can continue to promote openness is to remain engaged, even where we may disagree with a

country’s laws.



We act responsibly when it comes to the content on our platforms, and with services like Apple News, we

make it easy for our users to find timely information from the most trusted sources. Across all our services,

including the App Store, Apple Podcasts, and others, users can choose from a wide variety of options, and we

carefully review the content on every Apple app and service against our guidelines and standards.



We work every day to make quality products, including content and services, available to our users in a way

that respects their human rights. We’re required to comply with local laws, and at times there are complex

issues about which we may disagree with governments and other stakeholders on the right path forward.

With dialogue, and a belief in the power of engagement, we try to find the solution that best serves our

users—their privacy, their ability to express themselves, and their access to reliable information and helpful

technology.



Finally, when it comes to making technology that empowers and connects people, we’ve always believed in

creating the most accessible products and services in the world—because technology made for everyone

should meet everyone’s needs.



The Way We Make It

Respect for human rights shapes how we make our products and services. Our responsibilities go beyond our

stores and corporate offices: They extend to the people in our supply chain, the communities we’re a part of,

and the planet we all share.



Across our supply chain, we work hand in hand with our suppliers to ensure that every workplace provides a

safe and respectful environment for everyone. We do that through mandatory trainings on labor and human

rights, regular and independent audits, including surprise audits, and an anonymous reporting system in

which we investigate every complaint. If a company is not willing or able to meet our high standards, they risk

removal from our supply chain.



We want to be a force for good in the lives of people in our supply chain and their communities. We’re proud

to work with our neighbors and suppliers to develop new skill sets, start businesses, and advocate for

change. In addition to our global educational initiatives, we’ve partnered with human rights and environmental

defenders and international human rights nonprofits.



An essential part of our impact on humanity is our effort to protect the planet—in how we design, build, and

recycle our products.



We run Apple on 100 percent renewable energy, and we’re working with our suppliers to achieve carbon

neutrality across our entire supply chain by 2030. Every day, we’re working to make progress on our goal of

reaching a closed-loop supply chain that uses only recycled or renewable content. Even as we work toward

this goal, we remain committed to sourcing primary materials responsibly. And we’ve put our innovation and

expertise to the task of conserving water, recycling and recovering precious materials, and sharing our road

map for the future to inspire our industry peers to join us on our environmental journey.



How We Treat People

We’ve always said Apple’s soul is our people. That’s why we’re committed to respecting the human rights of

everyone whose lives we touch—including our employees, suppliers, contractors, and customers.



At Apple and throughout our supply chain, we do not tolerate any form of involuntary labor, harassment,

discrimination, violence, retaliation of any kind, or actions motivated by any form of prejudice or bigotry. We

require our employees to be trained annually on Apple’s Business Conduct Policy, which reflects our

commitment to respect human rights and to conduct business ethically, honestly, and in compliance with

applicable laws and regulations.



We’re also committed to a welcoming and inclusive environment for our teams around the world. Our efforts

are motivated by a strong desire to foster a culture of belonging where everyone is treated with dignity and

respect.



Transparency and Communication



We want everyone—from our customers to our industry peers—to know about our values and the progress

we’re making for people and the planet.



We track and measure our performance across a range of areas, and we apply the lessons we learn to

continually improve. We report our progress publicly, and updates are available at apple.com on topics

ranging from privacy to environmental performance to supply chain due diligence. To make sure our progress

is as meaningful and impactful as possible, we work with a broad range of groups—including workers’ rights

advocates and local leaders—and consult with rights holders and other stakeholders that include United

Nations bodies, governments, nongovernmental organizations, civil rights groups, and the world’s leading

human rights experts.



Our Board of Directors has adopted this policy on behalf of Apple and is responsible for overseeing and

periodically reviewing the policy. Apple’s Senior Vice President and General Counsel oversees the

implementation of our policy and reports to the Board and its committees on our progress and significant

issues.



We always strive to be an example for others to follow, and to share our progress to accelerate industry-wide

change. But we also know our work will never be finished—because we believe that if we aren’t finding ways

to improve, we aren’t looking hard enough.
