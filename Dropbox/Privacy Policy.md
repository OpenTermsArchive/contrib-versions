Dropbox Privacy Policy

Posted: February 20, 2014

Effective: March 24, 2014

Thanks for using Dropbox! Here we describe how we collect, use and handle your information when you use our websites, software and services ("Services").

What &. Why

We collect and use the following information to provide, improve and protect our Services:

_Account_. We collect, and associate with your account, information like your name, email address, phone number, payment info, and physical address. Some of our services let you access your accounts and your information with other service providers.

_Services_. When you use our Services, we store, process and transmit your files (including stuff like your photos, structured data and emails) and information related to them (for example, location tags in photos). If you give us access to your contacts, we'll store those contacts on our servers for you to use. This will make it easy for you to do things like share your stuff, send emails, and invite others to use the Services.

_Usage_. We collect information from and about the devices you use to access the Services. This includes things like IP addresses, the type of browser and device you use, the web page you visited before coming to our sites, and identifiers associated with your devices. Your devices (depending on their settings) may also transmit location information to the Services.

_Cookies and other technologies_. We use technologies like cookies and pixel tags to provide, improve, protect and promote our Services. For example, cookies help us with things like remembering your username for your next visit, understanding how you are interacting with our Services, and improving them based on that information. You can set your browser to not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability to use the Services. If our systems receive a DNT:1 signal from your browser, we'll respond to that signal as outlined here.

With whom

We may share information as discussed below, but we won't sell it to advertisers or other third-parties.

_Others working for Dropbox_. Dropbox uses certain trusted third parties to help us provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services. These third parties will access your information only to perform tasks on our behalf and in compliance with this Privacy Policy.

_Other users_. Our Services display information like your name and email address to other users in places like your user profile and sharing notifications. Certain features let you make additional information available to other users.

_Other applications_. You can also give third parties access to your information and account - for example, via Dropbox APIs. Just remember that their use of your information will be governed by their privacy policies and terms.

_Dropbox for Business Admins_. If you are a Dropbox for Business user, your administrator may have the ability to access and control your Dropbox for Business account. Please refer to your employer's internal policies if you have questions about this. If you are not a Dropbox for Business user but interact with a Dropbox for Business user (by, for example, joining a shared folder or accessing stuff shared by that user), members of that organization may be able to view the name, email address and IP address that were associated with your account at the time of that interaction.

_Law &. Order_. We may disclose your information to third parties if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with the law. (b) protect any person from death or serious bodily injury. (c) prevent fraud or abuse of Dropbox or our users. or (d) protect Dropbox's property rights.

Stewardship of your data is critical to us and a responsibility that we embrace. We believe that our users' data should receive the same legal protections regardless of whether it's stored on our services or on their home computer's hard drive. We'll abide by the following Government Request Principles when receiving, scrutinizing and responding to government requests for our users' data:

*   Be transparent,
*   Fight blanket requests,
*   Protect all users, and
*   Provide trusted services.

Please visit our Government Request Principles and Transparency Report for more detailed information. How

_Security_. We have a team dedicated to keeping your information secure and testing for vulnerabilities. We also continue to work on features to keep your information safe in addition to things like two-factor authentication, encryption of files at rest, and alerts when new devices and apps are linked to your account.

_Retention_. We'll retain information you store on our Services for as long as we need it to provide you the Services. If you delete your account, we'll also delete this information. But please note: (1) there might be some latency in deleting this information from our servers and back-up storage. and (2) we may retain this information if necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements.

Where

_Around the world_. To provide you with the Services, we may store, process and transmit information in locations around the world - including those outside your country. Information may also be stored locally on the devices you use to access the Services.

_Safe Harbor_. Dropbox complies with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Safe Harbor ("Safe Harbor") frameworks and principles. We have certified our compliance, and you can view our certifications here. You can learn more about Safe Harbor by visiting http://export.gov/safeharbor. TRUSTe is the independent organization responsible for reviewing and resolving complaints about our Safe Harbor compliance. We ask that you first submit any such complaints directly to us via privacy@dropbox.com. If you aren't satisfied with our response, please contact TRUSTe at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.

Changes

If we are involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition or sale of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that deal. We will notify you (for example, via a message to the email address associated with your account) of any such deal and outline your choices in that event.

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time, and will post the most current version on our website. If a revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will notify you.
