This information serves to substantiate your request and to improve the handling of your request. This information is expressly disclosed on a voluntary basis and with your consent, Article 6 paragraph 1 (a) GDPR. If this information corresponds to communication channels (for example, email address, telephone number), you also agree that we may also contact you via this communication channel to answer your request. Of course, you can withdraw this consent for the future at any time.

We delete the data that arises in this context after storage is no longer required, or we limit the processing if there are legal retention requirements.

  

**Registration and Service Use**

Registration

You have the opportunity to register with us and create a customer account. For the registration we collect and store the following data:

• Email address (username)  
• Password  

After registration, you will receive personal, password-protected access and can view and manage the data you have provided. Registration is voluntary but may be required to use our services.

If you use our service, we store your data and possibly also details of the payment method required to fulfill the contract, until you finally delete your account. Furthermore, we will store the voluntary data you provide for the time of your use of the portal, unless you delete it before. All information can be managed and changed in your account. The legal basis for this is Article 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 (b) and (f) GDPR.

Service Use

Furthermore, for technical and contractual reasons, we log anonymously how communities are managed and how often and in which way appointments are planned. This data is only collected during active use. Technical support or the “Community-Management” are recommended to the user based on this data. Additional data will not be purchased and the data will not be passed on to third parties. You can object to this kind of recommendation at any time. Please refer to the email address provided in point 4.1 for this purpose. The legal basis is Article 6 paragraph 1 sentence (f) GDPR.

  

**Online Orders – Website and In-App purchase**

When you place an order online on our website (and in-app), we collect various data required for the conclusion of the contract. The legal basis is the conclusion and execution of a contract in accordance with Article 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 (b) GDPR. The data is stored for the duration of the contract and according to legal obligations. For payment, we use various payment service providers, which are always identified and accept your input directly and are therefore recipients of your personal data collected in connection with the payment process. The legal basis for the engagement of payment service providers is the contract execution according to Article 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 (b) GDPR. Data for the purpose of payment is stored for the duration of the payment.

  

**Participation in Competitions**

If you participate in competitions, we will collect information necessary to conduct the competition. These are usually an individual competition entry (for example, a comment or a photo), as well as name and contact details. It may be that we pass on your data to our competition partners, e.g. to give you your prize. The data processing and data transfer may vary depending on the competition and is therefore described in detail in the respective conditions of participation. Participation in the competition and the associated data collection is of course voluntary. The legal basis for data processing is your consent according to Article 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 (a) GDPR. Your data will be deleted after the end of the competition.

  

**Social Media**

Use of Social Plugins

Our website and apps use social plugins from the providers Facebook, Twitter and Google. By default, these plugins collect data from you and transfer it to the servers of the respective provider. To protect your privacy, we have taken technical measures to ensure that your information can not be collected by the providers of the plug-in without your consent. When a page containing integrated plugins is accessed, these are initially deactivated. The plugins are only activated by clicking on the respective symbol and you give your consent that the data listed in point 5 are transferred to the respective provider.

In the case of Facebook, (for example in Germany) the IP address is anonymized immediately after collection, according to the provider. By activating the plugin, personal data will be transferred by you to the respective plugin provider and stored there (with US providers in the USA). Since the plugin provider carries out the data collection, in particular via cookies, we recommend that you delete all cookies via your browser's security settings before clicking to activate the plugin.

Data Processing Operations of the Plugin Providers

We have no influence on the collected data and data processing operations, nor are we aware of the full extent of data collection, the purpose of the processing or the retention periods. As a general rule, we also have no information about deleting the data collected by the plugin provider.

Purpose and Legal Basis of the Data Processing by the Plugin Providers

The plugin provider stores the data collected about you as usage profiles and uses them for purposes of advertising, market research and/or needs-based website design. Such an evaluation is carried out in particular (also for non-logged-in users) for the presentation of needs-based advertising and to inform other users of the social network about your activities on our website. You have the right to object to the creation of these user profiles; you must contact the respective plug-in provider to exercise this. Through the plugins, we offer you the opportunity to interact with the social networks and other users, so that we can improve our service and make it more interesting for you as a user. The legal basis for the use of the plugins is Article 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 (f) GDPR.

Data Transfer to the Plugin Providers

The data transfer takes place regardless of whether you have an account with the plugin provider and are logged in there. If you are logged in to the plugin provider, your data collected from us will be assigned directly to your existing account with the plugin provider. If you click the button once it has been activated and, for example, if you link to the page, the plugin provider also stores this information in your user account and shares it publicly with your contacts. We recommend that you log out regularly after using a social network, but especially before activating the button, as this will prevent you from being assigned to your profile with the plug-in provider.

**Use of Cookies**

When you use our website and our apps, cookies are stored on your computer. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device memory associated with the browser or app you are using, and that provide certain information to the party that sets the cookie. Cookies cannot run programs or transfer viruses to your device. They serve to make the Internet service more user-friendly and effective overall. We also use cookies to identify you for follow-up visits if you have an account with us. Otherwise you would have to log in again for each visit.

We use the following types of cookies, the scope and operation of which are explained below:

Transient Cookies

These cookies are automatically deleted when you close the browser or app. These include the session cookies in particular. These store a so-called session ID, with which various requests from your browser or app can be assigned to the shared session. This will allow your device to be recognized when you return. The session cookies are deleted when you log out or close the browser.

These cookies are automatically deleted after a specified period, which may differ depending on the cookie. You can delete the cookies in the security settings of your browser at any time.

Legal Basis and Duration of Storage

The legal bases for possible processing of personal data and their duration of storage vary and are presented in the following sections.

  

**Analysis Services**

For the purposes of analyzing and optimizing our websites and apps, we use various services, which are outlined below. So we can e.g. analyze how many people visit our site, what information is most in demand, and how people find the service. Among other things, we collect data on which website a data subject came to another website from (known as a referrer), which subpages of the website were accessed or how often a subpage was viewed and long the person remained on the subpage. This helps us to design and improve our services in a user-friendly way. The data collected is not intended to personally identify individual users. Anonymous or, at most, pseudonymized data is collected. The legal basis for this is Article 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 (f) GDPR.

Google Analytics & Google Optimize

Our website and apps use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc, (1600 Amphitheater Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA). Usage involves the Universal Analytics operating mode. This makes it possible to assign data, sessions and interactions across multiple devices to a pseudonymous user ID, thus analyzing the activities of a user across devices.

Our services also use Google Optimize. Google Optimize analyzes the use of different variations of our website and helps us to improve the usability according to the behavior of our users on the website. Google Optimize is a tool associated with Google Analytics.

Google Analytics and Google Optimize use cookies that allow you to analyze the use of the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. However, by activating IP anonymization on this website, your IP address will be shortened by Google beforehand within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there. For the exceptional cases in which personal data is transferred to the US, Google complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield, https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework. The IP address transferred by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be combined with other Google data. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide other services related to the website usage and internet usage to the website operator. In these purposes, our legitimate interest lies in the data processing. The data sent by us and linked to cookies, user IDs (e.g. user IDs) or advertising IDs will be automatically deleted after 26 months. Data that has reached its retention period is deleted automatically once a month. For more information about Terms of use and data protection, see https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html or https://policies.google.com/?hl=de.

You can prevent the storage of cookies by setting your browser software or settings of your mobile operating system and the app; however, please be aware that in this case you may not be able to use all functions of this website or the app in full. In addition, you may prevent the collection of the data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) by Google as well as the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de. Opt-out cookies prevent future collection of your data when you visit this website. To prevent Universal Analytics tracking across devices, you must opt out on all systems you use. If you wish that Gumb deactivate Google Analytics, please, send your request to our support team: Email: support@gumb.app. 

The legal basis is Article 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 (f) GDPR.
