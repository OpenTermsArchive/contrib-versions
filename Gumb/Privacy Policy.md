This aids us in identifying users' technical difficulties and providing effective assistance. Our goal is to continually refine our service through this process. You can review Zendesk's privacy policy [HERE](https://www.zendesk.com/company/agreements-and-terms/privacy-notice/?_ga=2.180671591.1554512012.1695114617-288658004.1695114617). The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 (f) GDPR. 

Of course, you can revoke this consent at any time in the future. We delete the data arising in this context after the storage is no longer necessary or restrict the processing if there are legal retention obligations (Art. 5 para. 1 e) of the GDPR or Art. 6 para. 4 DSG).

  

**5\. Registration and Service Use**

**5.1 Registration**

You have the opportunity to register with us and create a customer account. For the registration we collect and store the following data:

*   Email address (username)
*   Password

After registration, you will receive personal, password-protected access and can view and manage the data you have provided. Registration is voluntary but may be required to use our services. If you use our service, we store your data and possibly also details of the payment method required to fulfill the contract, until you finally delete your account. Furthermore, we will store the voluntary data you provide for the time of your use of the app, unless you delete it before. All information can be managed and changed in your account. The legal basis for this is Article 6, paragraph 1 sentence 1 (b) and (f) GDPR.

  

**5.2 Service Use**

For technical reasons, we also log which planning functions and the number of events have been used in our app, in a pseudonymized form. This data is collected only during the active use of the app and serves for performance optimization and for recommending suitable features to the user. No additional data is acquired. You can object to this type of recommendation at any time. Please refer to the contact details provided in section 2. The legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 (f) GDPR.

  

**5.3 Preliminary Registration by Users with Special Privileges**

Users with special privileges, for instance, board members of a club with admin rights in the app, have the ability to pre-register customer accounts. For this purpose, we only collect and store:

*   Email address
*   First and last name
*   Temporary password

The responsibility for the legality of this preliminary registration, as well as obtaining any necessary consents, rests entirely with the user having these special privileges. Gumb merely provides the technical platform and assumes no liability for actions or omissions of the user with special privileges. Any individual privacy policies of the user with special privileges are independent of Gumb's policies, and we have no influence over them.

As soon as a user with special privileges creates a preliminary account for you, you will be promptly notified by us. In this notification, you'll receive a temporary password, allowing you to directly log into our platform to view and manage the pre-registered data. If you did not consent to the creation of an account in your name or if you're not interested in using our app, you have the option to delete this account on your own. Gumb does not automatically delete your account. However, we reserve the right to deactivate inactive user profiles after a certain period and eventually delete them to uphold your privacy rights and to minimize unnecessary data storage. Before final deletion, we will notify you. Should you desire an immediate deletion of your account, please contact us, specifying your email address, at **[support@gumb.app](mailto:support@gumb.app)**.

The legal basis for Gumb's processing of this data is grounded in our legitimate interest, in accordance with Article 6, Paragraph 1, Subsection 1(f) of the GDPR. Any subsequent processing by the user with special privileges should be based on a suitable legal foundation, for which Gumb assumes no responsibility.

  

**6\. Online Orders - Shop**

When you place an order online on our website or apps, we collect various data required for the conclusion of the contract. The legal basis is the conclusion and execution of a contract in accordance with Article 6, paragraph 1 sentence 1 (b) GDPR. The data is stored for the duration of the contract and according to legal obligations. The legal basis for storing the data due to statutory retention requirements is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit.c GDPR. For payment, we use various payment service providers, which are always identified and accept your input directly and are therefore recipients of your personal data collected in connection with the payment process. The legal basis for the engagement of payment service providers is the contract execution according to Article 6, paragraph 1 sentence 1 (b) GDPR. Data for the purpose of payment is stored for the duration of the payment.

  

**7\. Participation in Competitions**

If you participate in competitions, we collect the information necessary for the execution of the competition.

We may share your information with our competitors, for example to give you your prize.

The data processing and transmission may vary depending on the competition and is therefore described in detail in the respective conditions of participation. Participation in the competition and the associated data collection is, of course, voluntary.

Google Analytics and Google Optimize uses cookies that enable an analysis of your use of our apps. The information collected by the cookies about your use of our apps is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored.

We use the function User-ID. The User ID allows us to assign a unique, permanent ID to one or more sessions (and the activities within these sessions) and to analyze user behavior across devices.

We use Google Signals. This allows Google Analytics and Google Optimize to collect additional information about users who have activated personalized ads (interests and demographic data). Furthermore, ads can be delivered to these users in cross-device remarketing campaigns.

We use the function 'anonymizeIP' (so-called IP-Masking): Due to the activation of IP-anonymization on our website or apps , your IP-address will be shortened by Google within member states of the European Union or in other signatory states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases the full IP address will be transferred to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. The IP address transmitted by your browser / Device Operating System within the framework of Google Analytics is not merged with other data from Google.

  

During your app use the following data will be collected:

*   The pages you call up, your "click behavior“
*   Achievement of "website / apps goals" (conversions, e.g., newsletter registrations, downloads, purchases)
*   Your user behavior (for example clicks, dwell time, bounce rates)
*   Your approximate location (region)
*   Your IP addresses (in abbreviated form)
*   Technical information about your browser and the end devices you use (e.g., language settings, screen resolution)
*   Your internet provider
*   The referrer URL (via which website/advertising medium you came to this website/apps)

  

**12.2.2 Purposes of processing**

On behalf of the operator of this app, Google will use this information to evaluate your (pseudonymous \[NOT USER ID\]) use of the app and to compile reports on the app activity. The reports provided by Google Analytics serve to analyze the performance of our apps and the success of our marketing campaigns.

  

**12.2.2 Recipient**

The data recipient is 

*   Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland

**12.2.3 Transfer to third countries**

A transfer of data to the USA cannot be excluded. However, we pay attention to ensure their compliance to GDPR guidelines.

  

**12.2.4 Duration of storage**

The data sent by us and linked to cookies is automatically deleted after 2 months. Data is automatically deleted once a month as soon as the storage period is reached.

  

You can also prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the app (including your IP address) to Google and the processing of this data by Google by

*   not giving your consent to the settings of the cookie or
*   downloading and installing the browser add-on to disable Google Analytics [HERE](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en).

  

By setting your browser software accordingly you can also prevent the storage of cookies. If your browser is set to refuse all cookies, the functionality of this and other websites and apps may be limited.

The technology for advertising is provided by Google Ad Manager. This information may also be shared with third parties such as ad networks. A list of all advertising networks can be found [here](https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/9012903?hl=en). The legal basis for this is Article 6, paragraph 1 sentence 1 (f) GDPR. Gumb’s direct marketing operations have a legitimate interest in the objectives pursued with the data processing. You have the right to object at any time to the processing of your data for the purpose of such advertising. For this purpose, you can prevent cookies from being set in your browser settings, via the cookie banner or privacy settings in our apps. The legal basis is Art. 6, para. 1 a) of the GDPR or Art. 6 para. 6 DSG.

  

**13.1 Facebook Advertising**

We use the pixel of Facebook Ireland Limited for targeting (Facebook Website Custom Audiences) and conversion tracking purposes. Through the pixel, information about the use of our products is collected and shared with Facebook. This information can be assigned to you thanks to further information that Facebook Ireland Limited has stored about you, e.g., due to your ownership of an account on the social network Facebook. Based on this information interest-related advertisements can be displayed to you in your Facebook account. 

We have not enabled “automatic advanced matching” as part of Facebook’s pixel feature. Therefore, we do not share hashed information such as email, name, gender, city, state, zip code, and date of birth or phone number with Facebook. The pixel of Facebook gets only activated in your browser if you have agreed to marketing cookies via our cookie consent banner. You can revoke consent at any time via our consent banner. The legal basis for this is article 6, section 1 letter (a), (f) of the GDPR.

For more information on the purpose and scope of data collection and the further processing and use of data by Facebook and your options to protect your privacy, please refer to Facebook’s privacy policy, which can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/ads/website_custom_audiences/) and [here](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation). If you wish to object to the use of Facebook Website Custom Audiences, you can do so on [this page](https://www.facebook.com/ads/website_custom_audiences/).

  

**13.2 Google Ads**

**13.2.1 Google Retargeting**

Our products use “Google Ads Remarketing” to advertise Gumb on Google’s search results as well as on third-party websites. The provider is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, 4 Barrow St., Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland (hereinafter "Google"). For this purpose, Google sets a cookie in your device's browser that automatically enables interest-based advertising based on a pseudonymous cookie ID and on the pages you visit.

Additional data processing only takes place if you have consented to Google, linking your Internet and app browsing history to your Google account and using information from your Google account to personalize ads that you see on the web.

Data processing from our apps will only be enabled if you have agreed to the use of marketing cookies via our cookie consent banner. You can revoke consent at any time via our consent banner. The legal basis for this is article 6, section 1 letter (a), (f) of the GDPR.

Further information and the privacy policy regarding advertising and Google can be found [here](https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/).

  

**13.2.2 Google Conversion Tracking**

We use conversion tracking as part of the “Google Ads” service. When you click on an ad placed by Google, a cookie for conversion tracking is stored on your device. These cookies lose their validity after 30 days, do not contain any personal data and are therefore not used for personal identification. The information obtained using the conversion cookie is used to create conversion statistics for Google Ads customers who have opted in for conversion tracking. Google Ads conversion tracking will only be enabled if you have agreed to the use of marketing cookies via our cookie consent banner. You can revoke consent at any time via our consent banner. The legal basis for this is article 6, section 1 letter (a), (f) of the GDPR.

  

**13.3 YouTube with expanded data protection integration**

Our website embeds videos of the website YouTube. The website operator is Google Ireland Limited (“Google”), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.

We use YouTube in the expanded data protection mode. According to YouTube, this mode ensures that YouTube does not store any information about visitors to this website before they watch the video. Nevertheless, this does not necessarily mean that the sharing of data with YouTube partners can be ruled out as a result of the expanded data protection mode. For instance, regardless of whether you are watching a video, YouTube will always establish a connection with the Google DoubleClick network.

The YouTube videos on our website are embedded using a method that does NOT automatically establish a connection to YouTube. Only after your confirmation by clicking the button, a connection to YouTube’s servers will be established. As a result, the YouTube server will be notified, which of our pages you have visited. If you are logged into your YouTube account while you visit our site, you enable YouTube to directly allocate your browsing patterns to your personal profile. You have the option to prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account.

As soon as you start to play a YouTube video on this website, a connection to YouTube’s servers will be established. As a result, the YouTube server will be notified, which of our pages you have visited. If you are logged into your YouTube account while you visit our site, you enable YouTube to directly allocate your browsing patterns to your personal profile. You have the option to prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account.

Furthermore, after you have started to play a video, YouTube will be able to place various cookies on your device or comparable technologies for recognition (e.g., device fingerprinting). In this way YouTube will be able to obtain information about this website’s visitors. Among other things, this information will be used to generate video statistics with the aim of improving the user-friendliness of the site and to prevent attempts to commit fraud.

Under certain circumstances, additional data processing transactions may be triggered after you have started to play a YouTube video, which are beyond our control.

The use of YouTube is based on our interest in presenting our online content in an appealing manner. Pursuant to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, this is a legitimate interest. If appropriate consent has been obtained, the processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and § 25 (1) TTDSG, insofar the consent includes the storage of cookies or the access to information in the user’s end device (e.g., device fingerprinting) within the meaning of the TTDSG. This consent can be revoked at any time.

For more information on how YouTube handles user data, please consult the YouTube Data Privacy Policy under: [https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en).

  

**13.4 Google Web Fonts (local embedding)**

Our website uses so-called Web Fonts provided by Google to ensure the uniform use of fonts on this site. These Google fonts are locally installed so that a connection to Google’s servers will not be established in conjunction with this application.

For more information on Google Web Fonts, please follow this link: [https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq](https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq) and consult Google’s Data Privacy Declaration under: [https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en).

  

**14\. Data Transfer**

We host our systems with Amazon Web Services, Inc., 410 Terry Avenue North, Seattle, WA 98109, USA ("AWS"). For technical reasons, infrastructure maintenance may sometimes be conducted from the USA. AWS adheres to the EU-US Privacy Shield.

The legal basis for the aforementioned data processing is Article 6, Paragraph 1 f) GDPR, based on our legitimate interest. We aim to provide you with the technical infrastructure to offer our products and services.

Within AWS, we use specific services to ensure an optimal user experience and the highest security standards:

S3: This is our primary cloud storage service. We use it to securely and scalable store data, ensuring fast and reliable access to your data at all times.

Amazon Pinpoint: This service allows us to communicate with you through various channels, such as email, SMS, or push messages. It also helps us understand user behavior better and optimize our services accordingly.

Cognito: This is our identity management tool. It ensures secure access to our services and verifies that only authorized users have access to their data. Through 'Federated Identities', a secure and seamless user experience is created, providing you with various login options.

Amazon Simple Email Service (SES): A service specifically designed for sending and receiving emails, ensuring that the communications you receive from us are secure and reliable.

Additionally, AWS employs other services for specific functions, especially for Android mobile devices. This includes 'Amazon (Mobile) Analytics', which helps us understand the usage of our services better and continuously improve the user experience.

By disclosing this information, we want to ensure you are fully aware of how and where your data is processed within our technical infrastructure. For more detailed information on the privacy practices of these specific AWS services, we recommend consulting AWS's privacy policy.

Your data will not be shared with other third parties unless we are legally obligated to do so, the data transfer is necessary for the execution of the contractual relationship, or you have previously expressly consented to the sharing of your data.

External service providers and partner companies, such as online payment providers, only receive your data if this is necessary to process your order. In these cases, however, the amount of data transferred is limited to the required minimum.

Insofar as our service providers come into contact with your personal data, we ensure in the context of order processing in accordance with Art. 28 GDPR or Art. 9 DSG that they comply with the provisions of the data protection law in the same way. In addition, please note the respective privacy policy of the provider. The respective provider is responsible for the content of external services, where we check the appropriateness of the services for compliance with legal requirements.

We attach great importance to the processing of your data within the EU/EEA. However, we may use providers who process data outside the EU/EEA. In these cases, we ensure that the recipient ensures an adequate level of data protection before transferring your personal data. This means that a level of data protection comparable to standards within the EU is achieved through EU standard contracts or an adequacy decision.

  

**15\. Data Security**

We have taken extensive technical and operational security precautions to protect your data from accidental or intentional manipulation, loss, destruction, or access by unauthorized individuals. Our security procedures are regularly reviewed and adapted to technological developments (Art. 32 GDPR, Articles 7, 8 DSG).

  

**16\. Job Applications**

You can apply for a job with us online via our application portal. We process your personal data exclusively for the purpose of your application for an employment relationship, insofar as this is necessary for the decision on the establishment of an employment relationship with us. The legal basis for this is Article 6 para.1 b) of the GDPR and § 26 para. 1 with para. 8 p. 2 BDSG (job advertisement and implementation of pre-contractual measures) and Art. 6 para. 1 f) of the GDPR for unsolicited applications. Your personal data will be treated confidentially.

The following data can be processed by us in the application process:

*   Master data (title, first name, surname, if necessary date of birth)
*   Contact data (address, telephone, or mobile phone number, private email address)
*   Application data (e.g., profile picture as well as other documents such as CV, cover letter, overall application, certificates).

If we are unable to offer you a position, you reject an offer of a position or withdraw your application, we reserve the right to store the data you have transmitted based on our legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 f) of the GDPR) for up to 6 months as of the end of the application process (rejection or withdrawal of the application). The data is then deleted and the physical application documents destroyed. In particular, data is stored for evidence purposes in the event of a legal dispute. If the data will be foreseeably required after the 12-month period has expired (e.g., due to an impending or pending legal dispute), deletion will only take place if the purpose of further storage is no longer applicable.

Data can also be stored for a longer period of time if you consent to this in accordance with (Art. 6 para. 1 (a) of the GDPR or Art. 6 para. 6 DSG) or if statutory storage obligations preclude the deletion.

If we do not make you a job offer, you may be able to join our applicant pool. In case of admission, all documents and information from the application will be transferred to the applicant pool to contact you in case of suitable vacancies.

Admission to the applicant pool is based exclusively on your express consent (Art. 6 para. 1 (a) of the GDPR or Art. 6 para. 6 DSG). The submission agreement is voluntary and has no relation to the ongoing application procedure. You can revoke your consent at any time. In this case, the data from the applicant pool will be irrevocably deleted, provided there are no legal reasons for storage. The data from the applicant pool will be irrevocably deleted no later than two years after consent has been granted.

For operational reasons, certain backend operations or data storage of Wellfound may sometimes be based in locations apart from the EU. It is pertinent to note that Wellfound strictly complies with the principles of the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") and the California Consumer Protection Act ("CCPA").

The legal basis for the aforementioned data processing is Article 6, Paragraph 1 f) GDPR, based on our legitimate interest. Our primary objective is to optimize our recruitment processes, ensuring we connect with highly qualified developer candidates in a seamless and efficient manner.
