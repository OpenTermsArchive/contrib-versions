These Web Services Terms of Service (“**_Terms_**”) apply to your use of the “**_Web Services_**” (as defined in Section 1 below). The Web Services are provided by Comcast Cable Communications, LLC,  and its subsidiaries and affiliates (“**_Comcast,_**” “**_we,_**” “**_us,_**” or “**_our_**”).

The Software License Agreement (“**_Software License_**”) also applies to your use of the Web Services. The Software License is available here: [my.xfinity.com/terms/license/](https://www.xfinity.com/terms/license/). The Software License is incorporated into these Terms by this reference.

You must accept these Terms in order to use the Web Services.

By accepting these Terms, you agree to each provision in these Terms, whether or not you have read it.

**NOTE: THESE TERMS CONTAIN A BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION IN SECTION 15 THAT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THESE TERMS WITH RESPECT TO ALL OF THE WEB SERVICES.

IN ARBITRATION, THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY AND THERE IS LESS DISCOVERY AND APPELLATE REVIEW THAN IN COURT.**

1.  **Covered Web Services**

The following websites, apps, and services are covered by these Terms and we refer to them as “**_Web Services_**”:

*   Comcast or Xfinity-branded websites and web-based services that link to these Terms, such as: [xfinity.com](https://www.xfinity.com/), [xfinity.com/stream](https://www.xfinity.com/stream/), and [login.xfinity.com/login](https://login.xfinity.com/login);

These Terms do not apply to Xfinity TV, Xfinity Voice, Xfinity Internet, Xfinity Home, Xfinity Mobile, or to other products or services provided by Comcast that do not link to these Terms. These Terms do not apply to the Xfinity Stream app or tv.xfinity.com when these services are used to deliver Xfinity TV within the residence at which you have an Xfinity TV and Xfinity Internet subscription. These other products and services are subject to their own terms of service and policies. You can see the terms and policies that apply to the residential versions of these services by visiting [www.xfinity.com/policies](http://www.xfinity.com/policies).

Third-party websites, software, or services may be available through the Web Services, and have their own terms of service that you should read before you use them. Some of these third-party websites, software, or services may contain Comcast owned branding or co-branding, but we do not operate these properties. We are not responsible for their availability, content, products, or offerings. 

**2\. Privacy**

**7\. User Content**

You may post materials, information, feedback, suggestions, ideas, submissions, or other content on or to the Web Services (referred to specifically as “**_User Content_**,” and also generally as Content). We may link to certain forums, websites, or services, which also include User Content. We are not responsible for your User Content. You are solely responsible for any User Content that you create, transmit, or display using the Web Services, including any losses or damages we may suffer related to User Content. Your User Content must also conform to these Terms (including Section 5) and any community guidelines or comment policies posted on any forum, website, or service. Terms that apply to your feedback, suggestions, and submissions are available at [my.xfinity.com/terms/feedback](https://www.xfinity.com/terms/feedback). Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to post or contribute any content anywhere on or through the Web Services. The Web Services are not directed to children under the age of 13.

By submitting or posting your User Content, you grant us and our licensees a worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, and non-exclusive right and license to use, reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform, modify, sublicense, and distribute your User Content on, or in connection with, the Web Services or to promote the Web Services. You represent and warrant that you own your User Content or otherwise have the right to grant us the license in this Section.

We retain the right, but not the obligation, to review, remove, or modify any User Content for any reason in our sole discretion without prior notice or liability. By using the Web Services, you may receive Content that you find offensive, indecent, or objectionable. You access Content on the Web Services at your own risk. We make no representation or warranty regarding the effectiveness of any third-party tools or programs that may limit exposure to objectionable material.

**8\. Copyright Infringement**

Users of the Web Services and copyright owners should refer to the Comcast Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“**_DMCA_**”) Policy at [https://www.xfinity.com/dmca](https://www.xfinity.com/dmca) to learn more about how Comcast handles notifications of alleged copyright infringement and its repeat infringer policy.

**9\. Proprietary Rights**

We (or our licensors) own all legal right, title, and interest in and to the Web Services. This includes any intellectual property rights in the Web Services (whether or not those rights are registered, and wherever in the world those rights may exist). Trademarks used or displayed on the Web Services are owned by us, or by third parties other than us that offer or provide products and services on or through the Web Services. Our trademarks include, but are not limited to Comcast, the Comcast design logo, the “X” design logo, Xfinity, the Xfinity design logo, the Xfinity Mobile logo, and the Xfinity Mobile “o” mark.

We do not grant you any right to use any of our trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features. If we give you an explicit right to use any of these brand features in a separate written agreement, your use of these features must comply with that agreement, any applicable provisions of these Terms, and our brand guidelines as updated from time to time. You are not permitted to use any trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features of any company or organization on the Web Services in a way that may cause confusion about the owner or authorized user of such identifying marks.

**10\. Links to the Web Services**

You may link to any of the Web Services, but your link may not state or imply any affiliation, connection, endorsement, or sponsorship, or approval of your site by Comcast.

**11\. Term and Termination**

These Terms apply to all users of the Web Services and will be in effect from the date of your first acceptance of these Terms until the date you or we terminate your use of the Web Services. All representations, warranties, indemnifications, and limitations of liability contained in these Terms will survive termination of these Terms. Any other obligations hereunder will also survive if they relate to the period before termination or if, by their terms, they would be expected to survive termination.

**Unregistered Users.**  If you are an unregistered user of the Web Services, you can stop using those Web Services at any time. Doing so will terminate the applicability of these Terms to you with respect to those Web Services. We reserve the right to restrict, suspend, or terminate your use of any or all of the Web Services and terminate these Terms for any reason, and with or without notice. Because unregistered users are generally unknown to us, in most cases we cannot provide notice.

**Registered Users.**  If you are a registered user of the Web Services, you may terminate your registered user account at any time. Doing so will terminate these Terms with respect to that Web Service. We reserve the right to restrict, suspend, or terminate your registered user account for any or all of the Web Services and terminate these Terms for any reason, and with or without notice. Currently, registered user accounts for Comcast.net and Xfinity.com are associated with Xfinity TV, Xfinity Internet (including Xfinity WiFi), or Xfinity Voice services. You cannot terminate registered user accounts for Comcast.net and Xfinity.com without also terminating the associated Xfinity service. You may still be able to use your Comcast.net email address even if you terminate your Xfinity Internet service.

**12\. Exclusion of Warranties**

TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE WEB SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS IS," "WITH ALL FAULTS," "AS AVAILABLE," AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WE AND OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS, AFFILIATES, SUBSIDIARIES, SUPPLIERS, AGENTS, CONTRACTORS, DISTRIBUTORS, LICENSORS, AND BUSINESS PARTNERS (AND EACH OF THEIR AND OUR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, CONTRACTORS, AND REPRESENTATIVES) (COLLECTIVELY, THE “**_RELEASED ENTITIES_**”) CANNOT AND DO NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, USEFULNESS, TIMELINESS, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF THE WEB SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY CONTENT MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE WEB SERVICES. ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED AND EXCLUDED, UNLESS OTHERWISE PROHIBITED OR RESTRICTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF POSSIBLE SOURCES OF INFORMATION AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE WEB SERVICES, AND THE UNCERTAINTIES OF ELECTRONIC DISTRIBUTION, THERE MAY BE INTERRUPTIONS, DELAYS, OMISSIONS, INACCURACIES, OR OTHER PROBLEMS WITH THIS CONTENT. YOU RELY ON THE WEB SERVICES (OR ANY CONTENT MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THEM) AT YOUR OWN RISK. WE AND THE RELEASED ENTITIES CANNOT AND DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE WEB SERVICES WILL OPERATE WITHOUT DELAY, OR CONTINUOUSLY BE AVAILABLE, OR BE FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES, OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. WE AND THE RELEASED ENTITIES CANNOT, AND DO NOT, WARRANT THAT THE WEB SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS.

**13\. Limitation of Liability**

The limitations of liability in this Section apply to Comcast and its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors, successors, and assigns; each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents (also “**_we_**,” “**_us_**,” and “**_our_**”); and any of the Released Entities.

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THESE TERMS, IN NO EVENT WILL WE OR THE RELEASED ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING OR RESULTING FROM ANY INTERRUPTION IN, OR DISRUPTION TO, THE WEB SERVICES.

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THESE TERMS, IN NO EVENT WILL WE OR THE RELEASED ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, TREBLE, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSSES OR DAMAGES (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOST DATA, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF EARNINGS, OR LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES) (“**_DAMAGES_**”), REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL THEORY, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE, AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WE OR ANY OF THE RELEASED ENTITIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

IN NO EVENT WILL OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATING TO, THESE TERMS EXCEED THE GREATER OF: (A) $2,500; OR (B) THREE (3) TIMES THE AGGREGATE AMOUNTS PAID OR PAYABLE BY YOU TO US, PURSUANT TO THESE TERMS IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT THAT GAVE RISE TO THE CLAIM. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THIS PARAGRAPH WILL NOT APPLY TO INJURIES: (X) TO THE BODY OR PERSON; OR (Y) CAUSED BY OUR WILLFUL, MALICIOUS, RECKLESS, OR GROSSLY NEGLIGENT ACTS OR OMISSIONS.

THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SHALL SURVIVE THE TERMINATION OF THESE TERMS. BECAUSE THE LAW REGARDING LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY VARIES BY STATE, THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. **NOTICE TO NEW JERSEY CONSUMERS**: THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY APPLY IN NEW JERSEY.

**14\. One Year Limitation Period**

YOU WAIVE THE RIGHT TO ASSERT A CLAIM AGAINST US MORE THAN TWELVE (12) MONTHS AFTER THE FIRST EVENT OR FACT THAT GIVES RISE TO THE CLAIM.

**15\. Binding Arbitration, and Class/Collective/Representative Action/Relief Waiver**

If you are a user of, or subscriber to, Xfinity TV, Xfinity Voice, and/or Xfinity Internet, please refer to the Binding Arbitration section of the Xfinity Agreement for Residential Services, which applies to any Dispute (as defined in that agreement) between you and Comcast for those services. The Xfinity Residential Services Agreement is available at [www.xfinity.com/Corporate/Customers/Policies/SubscriberAgreement](http://www.xfinity.com/Corporate/Customers/Policies/SubscriberAgreement).

If you are not a subscriber to those services, any Dispute (as defined below in these Terms) involving you and Comcast shall be resolved through individual arbitration. In arbitration, there is no judge or jury, and there is less discovery and appellate review than in court. This Section 15 (the "**_Arbitration Provision_**") shall be broadly interpreted.

**Definitions**. The term "**_Dispute_**" means any and all claims or controversies arising out of or related to the Web Services, these Terms, or our relationship with you, including but not limited to any and all: (1) claims for relief and theories of liability, whether based in contract, tort, fraud, negligence, statute, regulation, ordinance, or otherwise; (2) claims or controversies that arose before these Terms or any prior agreement; (3) claims or controversies that arise after the expiration or termination of these Terms; and (4) claims or controversies that are the subject of purported class, collective, or representative action litigation. As used in this Arbitration Provision, "**_Comcast_**" means Comcast Cable Communications, LLC and any of its parents, subsidiaries, and other affiliates, each of their respective predecessors, successors, and assigns, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents; and, “**_you_**” means you and any users or beneficiaries of your access to the Web Services.

**Exclusions**. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Disputes relating to the scope, validity, or enforceability of this Arbitration Provision will not be subject to arbitration.

**Right to Sue in Small Claims Court.** Notwithstanding anything in this Arbitration Provision to the contrary, either you or we may elect to have a Dispute heard in a small claims court if the claim(s) underlying the Dispute is not aggregated with the claim(s) of any other person and if the amount in controversy is properly within the jurisdiction of the small claims court.

**Right to Opt Out.** IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES, YOU MAY DECLINE TO HAVE YOUR DISPUTES WITH COMCAST ARBITRATED BY NOTIFYING COMCAST IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS OF YOUR FIRST ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE WEB SERVICES (i) BY VISITING [WWW.XFINITY.COM/WEBARBOPTOUT](http://www.xfinity.com/WEBARBOPTOUT), OR (ii) BY MAIL TO COMCAST, 1701 JOHN F. KENNEDY BLVD., PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103-2838, ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT / ARBITRATION. ANY SUCH WRITTEN NOTIFICATION TO COMCAST MUST INCLUDE YOUR NAME, ADDRESS, AND ACCOUNT NUMBER (IF YOU ARE A COMCAST SUBSCRIBER) OR TELEPHONE NUMBER (IF YOU ARE NOT A COMCAST SUBSCRIBER), AND A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH COMCAST THROUGH ARBITRATION. YOUR DECISION TO OPT OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION WILL HAVE NO ADVERSE EFFECT ON YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH COMCAST OR THE WEB SERVICES PROVIDED BY COMCAST. IF YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY OPTED OUT OF ARBITRATION WITH COMCAST, YOU DO NOT NEED TO DO SO AGAIN. ANY OPT-OUTS SUBMITTED AFTER THIS 30-DAY PERIOD WILL NOT BE EFFECTIVE AND ALL DISPUTES WITH COMCAST WILL BE ARBITRATED.

**Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding/Selection of Arbitrator.** Before either party initiates an arbitration proceeding, that party must first provide an opportunity to resolve the Dispute by sending the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”).  You may download a Notice form at www.xfinity.com/nod. You may send the completed Notice by U.S. mail to Comcast, 1701 John F. Kennedy Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA 19103-2838 – ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT/ARBITRATION, or submit the completed Notice electronically by following the instructions at www.xfinity.com/nod. We may send you the completed Notice by either posting the Notice on your Xfinity.com account or sending you the Notice by mail to the Premises or by email at the email address we have on file for your account. The Notice must include all of the information requested on the Notice form, including, as applicable: (a) the noticing party’s name; (b) the relevant Comcast account number(s) and service address of the Premises; (c) the Web Services (if any) to which the Dispute pertains; (d) a description of the nature and basis of the Dispute; (e) an explanation of the specific relief sought and the basis for any damages calculations; (f) the noticing party’s signature; and (g) if you have retained an attorney, your signed statement authorizing Comcast to disclose your confidential Account records and other information to your attorney if necessary to resolve your Dispute. You and we each agree to negotiate to resolve the Dispute in good faith, and that neither you nor we may initiate an arbitration proceeding unless you and we are unable to resolve the Dispute within 60 days of the other’s receipt of a complete Notice that includes all of the foregoing information. (If you or we send an incomplete Notice, the 60-day good faith negotiation period will begin only after the complete Notice is received by you or us.)  Any statute of limitation relevant to a Dispute under applicable law shall be tolled from the date of receipt of a completed Notice, through and including the foregoing negotiation period, and continuing until final resolution of any arbitration proceeding, unless the party providing the Notice of Dispute withdraws or abandons the Dispute at any point, or the arbitration proceeding is withdrawn or dismissed.

Either you or we may initiate an arbitration proceeding by opening a case with the American Arbitration Association (“**_AAA_**”) by visiting its website ([www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/)). You may deliver any required or desired notice to Comcast by mail to Comcast, 1701 John F. Kennedy Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA 19103-2838 – ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT/ARBITRATION.

**Arbitration Procedures.** Any arbitration under this Arbitration Provision shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. Arbitrations shall be administered by the AAA pursuant to the most recent version of its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “**_AAA Rules_**”) as modified by the version of this Arbitration Provision that is in effect when you notify Comcast about your Dispute. You can obtain the AAA Rules from the AAA by visiting its website ([www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/)) or calling its toll-free number (1-800-778-7879). If there is a conflict between this Arbitration Provision and the rest of these Terms, this Arbitration Provision shall govern. If there is a conflict between this Arbitration Provision and the AAA Rules, this Arbitration Provision shall govern. If the AAA will not administer a proceeding under this Arbitration Provision as written, you and Comcast shall agree on a substitute arbitration organization. If you and Comcast cannot agree, you and Comcast shall mutually petition a court of appropriate jurisdiction to appoint an arbitration organization that will administer a proceeding under this Arbitration Provision, as written, applying the AAA Rules. A single arbitrator will resolve the Dispute. Unless you and Comcast agree otherwise, any arbitration hearing will take place at a location convenient to you in the area where you reside when you notify Comcast of your Dispute. The arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized by law and will take reasonable steps to protect customer account information and other confidential or proprietary information. The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision that explains the arbitrator’s essential findings and conclusions. The arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties only if necessary for purposes of enforcing the arbitrator’s award. An arbitrator’s award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court.

**Waiver of Class, Collective, and Representative Actions/Relief.** THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY CLAIMS TO BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED (I) ON A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR OTHER JOINT OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS, OR (II) ON BASES INVOLVING CLAIMS BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC (SUCH AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL), OTHER SUBSCRIBERS, OR OTHER PERSONS. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT INDIVIDUAL PARTY’S CLAIM, AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT AWARD RELIEF FOR OR AGAINST OR ON BEHALF OF ANYONE WHO IS NOT A PARTY. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OTHER JOINT OR CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER OF CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OTHER JOINT OR CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS AND RELIEF IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION AND CANNOT BE SEVERED FROM IT. THE REMAINING PORTIONS OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION ARE NOT ESSENTIAL PARTS OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION AND CAN BE SEVERED FROM IT BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION.

**Arbitral Fees and Costs.** If your claim seeks more than $75,000 in the aggregate, the payment of the AAA’s fees and costs will be governed by the AAA Rules. If your claims seek less than $75,000 in the aggregate, the payment of the AAA’s fees and costs will be Comcast’s responsibility, so long as you have fully complied with the requirements of Section 15 for any arbitration you initiated. However, if the arbitrator finds that your Dispute was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), the payment of the AAA’s fees and costs shall be governed by the AAA Rules, and you shall reimburse Comcast for all fees and costs that were your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. You may hire an attorney to represent you in arbitration. You are responsible for your attorneys’ fees and additional costs. You may only recover your attorneys’ fees and costs in the arbitration if the arbitration is decided in your favor and to the extent that you could have recovered those fees in court in accordance with the law or statute(s) that apply to the case. You and we agree that the parties have a mutual interest in reducing the costs and increasing the efficiency of arbitration, and as such, either party may negotiate with the AAA for lower fees and costs and for streamlined or other procedures designed to reduce the costs and increase the efficiency of arbitration.  Notwithstanding anything in this Arbitration Provision to the contrary, we will pay all fees and costs that we are required by law to pay.

**Survival.** This Arbitration Provision will survive the termination or expiration of these Terms.

**16\. Waiver of Jury Trial**

WHETHER ANY DISPUTE IS RESOLVED IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION, YOU AND WE AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RELATION TO THE DISPUTE.

**17\. Indemnification**

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless us and the Released Entities from and against all claims, losses, expenses, damages, and costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) resulting from or in connection with any suits, judgments, and causes of action arising out of: (a) your use of the Web Services and User Content, including any related actual or alleged violation or infringement of contractual rights, privacy, confidentiality, copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights; and (b) any actual or alleged breach of these Terms by you or any individual with whom you share your Web Services account or an Activated Device. We reserve the right, at our election, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, including, but not limited to, selection of outside counsel. You agree to cooperate with us in connection with our defense.

**18\. About These Terms**

These Terms constitute the entire legal agreement between you and us for your use of the Web Services, and completely replace any prior agreements in relation to the Web Services.

Upon termination of these Terms for any reason, we (and our suppliers) reserve the right to delete all your User Content, data, files, electronic messages, or other information that is stored on our or our suppliers' servers or systems. We are not responsible for the loss of any such data.

We may decide not to enforce our rights or exercise a remedy under these Terms in certain instances. This will not be a waiver of our rights or remedies.
