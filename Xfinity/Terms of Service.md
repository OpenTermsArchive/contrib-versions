**Why is Comcast providing this Policy to me?**

Comcast's goal is to provide its customers with the best residential cable Internet service possible. In order to help accomplish this, Comcast has adopted this Acceptable Use Policy (the “Policy”). This Policy outlines acceptable use of the residential XFINITY Internet service, including Comcast-provided XFINITY WiFi Internet service (collectively, the “Service”). This Policy is in addition to any restrictions or conditions contained in the Comcast Agreement for Residential Services (the “Subscriber Agreement”) available at https://www.xfinity.com/policies. The Frequently Asked Questions (“FAQs”) at https://www.xfinity.com/support/internet/comcast-acceptable-use-policy/ explain how Comcast implements and applies many of the provisions contained in this Policy. All capitalized terms used in this Policy that are not defined here have the meanings given to them in the Subscriber Agreement.

All residential XFINITY Internet customers (the “customer,” “user,” “you,” or “your”) and all others who use the Service must comply with this Policy. Your failure, or others’ failure, to comply with this Policy could result in the suspension or termination of your or their Service accounts. Therefore, you should take steps to ensure that others you permit to use your Service are aware of this Policy and agree to abide by it. If you are unwilling to comply with this Policy, you must immediately stop all use of the Service and notify Comcast so that it can close your account.

**Does this Policy apply to my use of XFINITY WiFi-identified services inside and outside of my premises and in public places?**

This Policy applies to your use of the Service if you are a residential XFINITY Internet customer who accesses Comcast-provided, XFINITY WiFi-identified services inside or outside of your premises or in public places using an XFINITY Internet login and password. You can learn more about Comcast-provided XFINITY WiFi services by going to the portal at https://wifi.xfinity.com/. In the event certain provisions of this Policy may not apply to all uses of XFINITY WiFi-identified services, we explain those exceptions in the FAQs at https://wifi.xfinity.com/faq.php.

**How will I know when Comcast changes this Policy and how do I report violations of it?**

Comcast may revise this Policy from time to time by posting a new version on the web site at https://www.xfinity.com/ or any successor URL(s) (the “XFINITY Web site”). Comcast will use reasonable efforts to make customers aware of any changes to this Policy, which may include sending email announcements or posting information on the XFINITY Web site. Revised versions of this Policy are effective immediately upon posting. Accordingly, customers of the Service should read any Comcast announcements they receive and regularly visit the XFINITY Web site and review this Policy to ensure that their activities conform to the most recent version.

    **How does Comcast address inappropriate content and transmissions?**
    
    Comcast reserves the right to refuse to transmit or post, and to remove or block, any information or materials, in whole or in part, that it, in its sole discretion, deems to be in violation of Sections I or II of this Policy, or otherwise harmful to Comcast's network or customers using the Service, regardless of whether this material or its dissemination is unlawful so long as it violates this Policy. Neither Comcast nor any of its affiliates, suppliers, or agents have any obligation to monitor transmissions or postings (including, but not limited to, email, file transfer, blog, newsgroup, and instant message transmissions) made on the Service. However, Comcast and its affiliates, suppliers, and agents have the right to monitor these transmissions and postings from time to time for violations of this Policy and to disclose, block, or remove them in accordance with this Policy, the Subscriber Agreement, and applicable law.
    
    **What requirements apply to electronic mail?**
    
    The Service may not be used to communicate or distribute email or other forms of communications in violation of Section I of this Policy. As described below in Section III of this Policy, Comcast uses reasonable network management tools and techniques to protect customers from receiving spam and from sending spam (often without their knowledge over an infected computer). Comcast's anti-spam approach is explained in the FAQs under the topic “What is Comcast doing about spam?” located at https://www.xfinity.com/support/internet/reducing-spam-email/.
    
    Comcast is not responsible for deleting or forwarding any email sent to the wrong email address by you or by someone else trying to send email to you. Comcast is also not responsible for forwarding email sent to any account that has been suspended or terminated. This email will be returned to the sender, ignored, deleted, or stored temporarily at Comcast's sole discretion. If you cancel or terminate your Service account for any reason, all email associated with that account (and any secondary accounts) will be permanently deleted as well.
    
    If Comcast believes in its sole discretion that any subscriber name, account name, or email address (collectively, an “identifier”) on the Service may be used for, or is being used for, any misleading, fraudulent, or other improper or illegal purpose, Comcast (i) reserves the right to block access to and prevent the use of any of these identifiers and (ii) may at any time require any customer to change his or her identifier. In addition, Comcast may at any time reserve any identifiers on the Service for its own purposes.
    
3.  **Network Management** **Why does Comcast manage its network?**
    
    Comcast manages its network with one goal: to deliver the best possible broadband Internet experience to all of its customers. High-speed bandwidth and network resources are not unlimited. Managing the network is essential as Comcast works to promote the use and enjoyment of the Internet by all of its customers. The company uses reasonable network management practices that are consistent with industry standards. Comcast tries to use tools and technologies that are minimally intrusive and, in its independent judgment guided by industry experience, among the best in class. Of course, the company's network management practices will change and evolve along with the uses of the Internet and the challenges and threats on the Internet.
    
    The need to engage in network management is not limited to Comcast. In fact, all large Internet service providers manage their networks. Many of them use the same or similar tools that Comcast does. If the company didn't manage its network, its customers would be subject to the negative effects of spam, viruses, security attacks, network congestion, and other risks and degradations of service. By engaging in responsible network management including enforcement of this Policy, Comcast can deliver the best possible broadband Internet experience to all of its customers. Visit Comcast's Network Management page at https://networkmanagement.xfinity.com/ for more information.
    
    **How does Comcast manage its network?**
    
    Comcast uses various tools and techniques to manage its network, deliver the Service, and ensure compliance with this Policy and the Subscriber Agreement. These tools and techniques are dynamic, like the network and its usage, and can and do change frequently. For example, these network management activities may include (i) identifying spam and preventing its delivery to customer email accounts, (ii) detecting malicious Internet traffic and preventing the distribution of viruses or other harmful code or content, (iii) temporarily lowering the priority of traffic for users who are the top contributors to current network congestion, and (iv) using other tools and techniques that Comcast may be required to implement in order to meet its goal of delivering the best possible broadband Internet experience to all of its customers.
    
4.  **Data Consumption** **What data consumption requirements apply to the Service?**
    
    Comcast applies a monthly data consumption threshold to XFINITY Internet accounts in most of our service areas. The company retains the right to trial or adopt a different data consumption threshold or other usage plan for the Service at any time. If we do this we will notify customers and, if necessary, post an updated version of this Policy. You can learn about the data plan that applies in your area by going to https://dataplan.xfinity.com/. You can view your current data usage at any time by logging into your My Account page and viewing the data usage meter at https://customer.xfinity.com/MyServices/Internet/UsageMeter/. You can also use the XFINITY My Account mobile app to view your data usage.
    
5.  **Violation of this Acceptable Use Policy** **What happens if you violate this Policy?**
    
    Comcast reserves the right immediately to suspend or apply other interim measures in its sole discretion to your Service, or terminate your Service account and terminate the Subscriber Agreement if you violate the terms of this Policy or the Subscriber Agreement, or if anyone else you permit to access the Service violates this Policy. In that event, Comcast also reserves the right to downgrade, suspend, or terminate other Comcast services you receive.
    
    Comcast does not routinely monitor the activity of individual Service accounts for violations of this Policy, except for determining aggregate data consumption in connection with Section IV of this Policy. However, in the company's efforts to promote good citizenship within the Internet community, it will respond appropriately if it becomes aware of inappropriate use of the Service. Comcast has no obligation to monitor the Service and/or the network. Comcast and its suppliers reserve the right at any time to monitor bandwidth, usage, transmissions, and content in order to, among other things, operate the Service. identify violations of this Policy. and/or protect the network, the Service and Comcast users.
    
    Comcast prefers to inform customers of inappropriate activities and give them a reasonable period of time in which to take corrective action. Comcast also prefers to have customers directly resolve any disputes or disagreements they may have with others, whether customers or not, without Comcast's intervention. However, if the Service is used in a way that Comcast or its suppliers, in their sole discretion, believe violates this Policy, Comcast or its suppliers may take any responsive actions they deem appropriate under the circumstances with or without notice. These actions include, but are not limited to, temporary or permanent removal of content, filtering of Internet transmissions, and the immediate suspension or termination of all or any portion of the Service. Neither Comcast nor its affiliates, suppliers, or agents will have any liability for any of these responsive actions. These actions are not Comcast's exclusive remedies and Comcast may take any other legal or technical actions it deems appropriate with or without notice.
    
    Comcast reserves the right to investigate suspected violations of this Policy, including the gathering of information from the user or users involved and the complaining party, if any, and examination of material and data on Comcast's servers and network. During an investigation, Comcast may suspend the account or accounts involved and/or remove or block material that potentially violates this Policy. You expressly authorize and consent to Comcast and its suppliers cooperating with (i) law enforcement authorities in the investigation of suspected legal violations, and (ii) and system administrators at other Internet service providers or other network or computing facilities in order to enforce this Policy. Upon termination of your Service account, Comcast is authorized to delete any files, programs, data, email and other messages associated with your account (and any secondary accounts).
    
6.  **Copyright** **How does Comcast communicate with customers about copyright?**
    
    Comcast is committed to complying with U.S. copyright and related laws, and requires all customers and users of the Service to comply with these laws. Accordingly, you may not store any material or content on, or access, share or disseminate any material or content over, the Service (or any part of the Service) in any manner that constitutes an infringement of third party intellectual property rights, including rights granted by U.S. copyright law. Comcast complies with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and provides a method for copyright owners to communicate information about alleged infringements to us, and for us to inform our customers about them. You may receive notices or alerts if your Service account is identified by a copyright owner as having been used in connection with acts of alleged copyright infringement.
    
    **What is Comcast's DMCA policy?**
    
    Owners of copyrighted works who believe that their rights under U.S. copyright law have been infringed may take advantage of certain provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) to report alleged infringements to us. In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable laws, Comcast also maintains a policy to terminate the Service, in appropriate circumstances, provided to any customer or user who is a repeat infringer of third party copyright rights. Comcast’s repeat infringer policy includes graduated or escalated alerts of alleged infringements, acknowledgement of alerts, suspension of the Service, the application of other interim measures determined in its sole discretion to the Service, and, in appropriate circumstances, termination of the Service (and other services provided by Comcast to you). You can learn more about Comcast’s DMCA and repeat infringer policies here. Comcast also reserves the right to terminate the Service at any time with or without notice for any affected customer or user who Comcast, in its sole discretion, believes is infringing any copyright or other intellectual property rights.
    
    **How do copyright owners report alleged infringements to Comcast under the DMCA?**
    
    Copyright owners may report alleged infringements of their works by sending Comcast's authorized agent a notification of claimed infringement that satisfies the requirements of the DMCA. Upon Comcast's receipt of a satisfactory notice of claimed infringement for these works, Comcast will respond expeditiously to either directly or indirectly (i) remove the allegedly infringing work(s), if applicable or (ii) disable access to the work(s). Comcast will also notify the affected customer or user of the Service of the removal or disabling of access to the work(s).

    **What can customers do if they receive a DMCA notification of alleged infringement?**
