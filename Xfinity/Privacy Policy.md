**The Comcast Services Covered by this Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy applies to the website at corporate.comcast.com and to other the Comcast or Xfinity-branded websites that link to this Privacy Policy, including www.xfinity.com. The privacy policy that applies to Comcast’s television, Internet, voice, and home security services is available at: www.xfinity.com/Corporate/Customers/Policies/CustomerPrivacy. the privacy policy for Xfinity web services, which includes my.xfinity.com and Xfinity mobile apps, is available at my.xfinity.com/privacy. and the privacy policy that applies to Xfinity Mobile is available at www.xfinity.com/mobile/policies/privacy-policy.

**The Categories of Data That Comcast Collects When You Use This Website**

Comcast collects the following types of data from users of this website: (1) the data visitors and users voluntarily submit (such as through order forms to purchase products and services, or by providing an e-mail address to receive newsletters, for example). and (2) connection, activity, and usage data, which Comcast records when visitors and users navigate to and around this website. Some of this data is personal data that identifies a particular person like an e-mail address or telephone number. But most of this data is not personal and identifies connections and devices by, for example, by Internet protocol addresses and cookies.

If you initially purchase products and services on www.xfinity.com, we collect your first and last name, e-mail address, street address, zip code, and phone number. We may also collect payment card data and ask for your social security number in order to run a credit check. On other Comcast websites, we only request your e-mail address so that we can send newsletters to you.

**How Comcast Uses the Data It Collects**

Comcast uses collected data, including personal data, to determine which products and services to offer to you and on what terms. This data also helps us to offer you more personalized features, complete the particular function of the website you are using, and tailor the website to your interests to make it more useful to you. We also use your personal data to fulfill your orders for products and services.

Whenever you provide personal data through this website, Comcast will use that personal data for: (1) the purposes we disclose on the website when Comcast asks you to submit the data (such as, for example, to process your purchase of a new subscription to Comcast’s services or to send you e-mail newsletters). or (2) to send you marketing communications, promotions, or other communications about Comcast’s products and services.

**How Comcast Shares and Discloses Personal Data**

Comcast considers the personal data it collects on this website to be confidential. Comcast may sometimes provide personal data to its affiliates or to third-party service providers that help Comcast provide this website to you. When Comcast shares personal data with third parties, it requires them to keep personal data confidential and to use the data only to provide the services to which you subscribe and to provide support for this website.

To make Comcast’s website more valuable to users, Comcast may offer some features in conjunction with other providers. For example, when you click on certain functions on this website, such as to log-in to a shareholder account, you may be re-directed to a website that is not operated by Comcast and may be subject to a privacy policy that is different than this one. Once you leave this website, any information you provide is governed by the privacy policies that appear on the website to which you have navigated. You should read those privacy policies to understand how those sites use your information.

Comcast may be required by law or legal process to disclose certain personal data to Comcast’s lawyers, to third parties in connection with litigation, or to law enforcement personnel. Comcast will disclose personal data in compliance with applicable laws. We may provide this information without your consent and without notice to you when we are required to do so in order to comply with a valid legal process such as a subpoena, court order, or search warrant.

**Cookies and Site Analytics**

Comcast and its service providers use technologies such as cookies and similar methods to collect information on this website. A cookie is a small file stored on your computer or device that is used by your browser or Adobe Flash Player, for example. Cookies enable Comcast to perform various functions on this website, such as to track the number of visitors to the website, analyze how well our website is performing, make sure this website is running properly, and to allow you to use the shopping cart when you order products and services. You can control most cookies and similar technologies through your browser by adjusting its privacy and security settings. If you block or restrict cookies, some functionality on this website may not work properly.

We may also use software technology on this website called clear gifs (sometimes referred to as "web beacons") to help us collect data about user activity. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to HTTP cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.

**Do Not Track Disclosure**

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) currently is engaged in a process to develop a “Do Not Track” Standard. Comcast’s websites do not currently respond to “Do Not Track” signals sent from browsers.

**Marketing**

Comcast, or its third party service providers, may automatically deliver marketing, promotions, and offers for Comcast’s products and services to users of this website based on data such as: (i) the Internet protocol address associated with your computer for purposes of determining your approximate geographic location. (ii) the type of web page that is being displayed, such as a page about Xfinity Internet or a page about Xfinity Mobile. or (iii) the content on the page that is shown. This activity automatically applies to all users and is purely contextual, so it cannot be customized or managed by individual users.

Sometimes Comcast offers different subscription plans in different areas of the country for our products and services. When you visit this website, we may use the IP address associated with your computer to determine your general geographic location so that we can show you offers for products and services available in your region. When you are interested in a specific product or service, we may also ask you to enter an address or zip code to determine exactly which offer, product, or service is available to you.

**Choices You May Make About Collection, Use, and Sharing of Personal Data**

Some Comcast websites that link to this Privacy Policy may allow you to submit your e-mail address for the purpose of receiving newsletters from Comcast. Most e-mail newsletters that you receive will include an “unsubscribe” function that allows you to ask Comcast to stop sending the e-mail newsletters to you. In addition, you may choose to opt-in or opt-out of receiving promotional e-mails about Comcast’s products and services by going to the web page located at www.comcast.com/preferences and following the instructions there. You may also opt-out of receiving marketing or promotional postal mail from Comcast if you contact Comcast at 1-800-COMCAST and ask us to put your name on our “do not mail” list.

**Security**

Comcast follows generally-accepted industry standards to protect the personal data submitted to Comcast, both during transmission and once Comcast receives it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is entirely secure.

As an additional security precaution, neither Comcast nor any of our authorized service providers will ask you for your Comcast password in an email, over the telephone, or in an online support forum or chat. Do not give your Comcast password to anyone in any of these places.

**Changes to Personal Data**

If you have submitted personal data on Comcast’s investor information page at www.cmcsa.com/alerts.cfm? to receive alerts and information, you may visit that page to update or edit your personal data.

**Users Outside of the United States**

The websites that link to this Privacy Policy are for users located in the United States. If you use this website from outside of the United States, then by providing any data to Comcast over this website or through another direct communication with Comcast, you understand and consent to the collection, use, processing, sharing, and disclosure of your personal data as described in this Privacy Policy. You also consent to the transfer of your personal data to the United States for this collection, use, processing, and disclosure. The European Commission has determined that the United States does not provide an adequate level of protection to personal data and it may not offer the same level of data protection as the country in which you reside, whether that country is in the European Economic Area or elsewhere outside of the United States.

**Children**

Comcast does not knowingly collect personal data from anyone under the age of 13 through this website, and this website is not directed to children under the age of 13. Children should always get permission from a parent or legal guardian before sending any information about themselves (such as their names, email addresses, and telephone numbers) over the Internet, to Comcast, or to anyone else.

**Change of Ownership or Other Business Transition**

If Comcast enters into a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition, or the sale of all or part of its assets, your personal data will likely be part of the assets transferred. We will notify you if this happens if we have a means to contact you and we are required to provide you with notice.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

Comcast reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy. When we change it, we will make a copy of it available to you by posting it at corporate.comcast.com and at www.xfinity.com, or through other methods. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will make you aware of them where we post the updated policy and may also notify you by other reasonable methods that we select. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy that will result in a new use, disclosure, or permission of access to your personal data that we previously collected and stored, we will obtain any consent that may be required by law.

You understand and agree that if you use this website after the effective date of the updated Privacy Policy, Comcast considers your use as acceptance of it.
