The Personal Information You Share with Us and Others
-----------------------------------------------------

The What

When you play our games, we—the Makers—get different kinds of personal information from you:

#### Voice & Text Chat

Blizzard offers in-game features, like chat, to allow players to communicate with one another to support our gameplay experiences and foster a positive community.

Remember that other players may hear your voice chats and read what you type. Be careful not to give out personal information in the chat and be respectful of other players.

#### Account & Identity Information

When you create or update your account, you give us information that can identify you, like your physical address. [This information is in your account.](https://account.battle.net/) You can easily change it in the settings.

We ask about your date of birth and country to apply appropriate settings, like parental controls on your account. Some personal information is collected to ensure the security of your account.

#### Orders & Payment Information

When you buy something from us, we get the details of your order. For example, the products or services you bought from us.

We keep the purchase history information about what you have bought. This is for keeping business records.

#### Location

We collect certain location information, such as the country you are in. This information allows us to apply appropriate settings to your account and games and to offer certain services. It is based on your IP address, a unique number assigned to your computer or device.

#### Game Data

When you play our games, we collect gameplay information like your Heroes, skins, or game progression. This game information (or data) helps us deliver the best gameplay experience and suggest relevant items for you to purchase or earn based on your gameplay.

Know How We Get Your Information
--------------------------------

The How

We, the Makers, get your personal information in three ways.

You give it to us directly

You give us information when you create an account, buy something through our online store play our games, play or team up with friends, use our message boards or forums, send Recruit-a-Friend e-mails, register for a contest, read our emails or view our websites, and/or contact us for technical support or service.

You don’t have to give us more personal information than we need to provide you access to our websites and games. You can choose not to share some information with us. But if you do, you may not be able to access some of our features.

You give it to us when you play our games

When you play our games, we automatically get information about how you play. We learn about what parts of the game you use and how you use them. We also get general information about your devices. We also know the activities you take part in when you install or access our services.

We get it from online sources

We also get information about you and your activities from other sources. For example, we learn about you when you link other accounts to your Battle.net account. You can link accounts like Facebook, PlayStation, XBOX or Twitch, and others. When you do so, we receive access based on your choice to share certain profile details with us, like username.

Let’s say you login to one of our sites or apps using another account (for example, Facebook Connect). We may ask if you wish to share information from your other account with us (for example, from your Facebook account).

If you take part in a game (or other feature) where your score is posted on social media, we may get some of your information. Or if you use the "like" or "share" button for a feature on our sites or apps, then the other source can share information with us.

We also receive information from advertisers or service providers about your experiences or interactions with them and public sites on the internet like Twitch, Instagram, and YouTube—to name a few.

See How We Keep Your Personal Data Safe
---------------------------------------

The Protection

Blizzard’s technology wizards don’t sleep much. They work night and day to protect your privacy. Testing. Updating. Testing again.

#### Security

Blizzard takes security seriously and follows physical, technical and administrative safeguards to keep your data safe. We consider all information related to your account to be your personal information. And we protect it in the same way.

#### Limiting Access

And that’s not all. We limit who at Blizzard can access your information. Only teams who need to know can get at it. We train our employees on how to keep your data safe. We keep the information you give us only as long as necessary.

#### Sharing Safely

One more thing. We also ask Partners who might have your information to protect it and keep it secure. We don’t work with Partners who don’t agree to these standards.

Important Tip
-------------

Before You Start Playing

Never share your personal information when you are playing our games. Be mindful about what you share in chat and on social media.

If you want to share your real name with friends, set up the optional Real ID system. Just go to your [Real ID settings in your Battle.net Account](https://account.battle.net/privacy#social-settings).

A Note to Parents:
------------------

Using Parental Controls

These help you control and limit the amount of time your child spends playing games and also helps you control other features, such as purchases. To set up Parental Controls, please [visit our dedicated area at Battle.net Support](https://battle.net/support/article/32243).

Teaching your children how to be safe online

We also urge you to teach your children about online safety. Remind them to never give out their real names, addresses, phone numbers, or other sensitive information without permission, and especially when chatting with other players.

Once a child states s/he is underaged in a defined country, s/he will be unable to register an account with us. If you as a parent think that we have unintentionally collected your child’s personal information, you can [contact us](https://battle.net/support/help).
