Travel terms and conditions
---------------------------

25 July 2024

These Travel Terms and Conditions of VR-Group Plc’s (hereinafter “VR”) Passenger Services apply to all train journeys and services organised by the Passenger Services in Finland.

These Terms and Conditions determine the rights and obligations of VR and its customers.

For additional information on Helsinki Region Transport (HSL) tickets, contact HSL or go to HSL’s website. Travelling with Interrail and Eurail Passes and various trip chain cooperation arrangements are subject to separate terms and conditions, which can be found on VR’s website.

The terms and conditions enter into force on July 25 2024 and are valid until further notice. They will replace VR’s Conditions of Carriage that entered into force on April 19 2024. Rules related to car transport can be checked from the [car transport terms and conditions](https://www.vr.fi/en/terms-and-conditions#car-transport).

1 Ticket
--------

A ticket is a contract of carriage, according to which VR shall transport the passenger from the departure station to the destination station. The passenger shall have a ticket that is valid throughout the train journey and approved by VR.

The passenger must have a valid ticket approved by VR with a QR code that can be scanned on the train for the entire duration of the journey. Simply having the order number or booking code of the ticket is not sufficient to prove the right to travel.

The train journey starts when the passenger has boarded the train or another means of transport arranged by VR. VR is responsible for transport other than rail transport only if it is arranged by VR. The journey ends when the passenger has exited the means of transport in question. 

Train timetables and the rolling stock may change in the period between the ticket purchase and the passenger’s journey. Customers that have given their contact information are informed of any material changes.

Personal tickets may only be used by the person whose name is marked on the ticket. In this case, the passenger shall be prepared to show a proof of identity. [The rules governing changes and cancellations of tickets are ticket-specific](https://www.vr.fi/en/train-tickets). VR charges a fee for changes and cancellations. Lost, damaged or partly used train tickets cannot be changed or cancelled. A ticket that has been activated through self-service will be considered used and cannot be changed or cancelled.

A ticket is not valid if the journey for the multi-ticket has not been reserved or the ticket has been altered or forged. The commercial resale of individual journeys booked with a multi-ticket is not permitted. If a multi-ticket is used in violation of the conditions, VR has the right to cancel the multi-ticket.

In VR’s long-distance traffic, the ticket shall be purchased from onboard personnel on the train at the latest. In VR’s commuter traffic, the ticket shall be purchased before boarding the train. 

Even if the passenger has a ticket, he or she may be removed from the train if he or she endangers the safety of the service or other passengers or disturbs other passengers.

### 1.1 Ticket in VR’s long-distance traffic

VR’s long-distance traffic encompasses journeys made on InterCity trains, Pendolino trains, express trains and railcars in the entire railway network in Finland. The customer shall always book a seat or a sleeping berth for single tickets and multi-tickets, with the exception of railcars and buses.

The ticket entitles the passenger to travel in the train, class and seat indicated on the ticket. Under exceptional circumstances, VR’s onboard personnel may show the passenger to a seat other than the one indicated on the ticket or chosen by the passenger.

VR reserves the right to resell a reserved place to another customer in case the reservation holder is not reached for ticket inspection within reasonable time.

If the ticket is unreadable or damaged, VR may refuse to accept the change or cancellation of the ticket. 

### 1.2 Ticket in VR’s commuter traffic

VR Commuter traffic encompasses traffic operated with commuter trains with line IDs in areas from Helsinki to Kotka/the Port of Kotka, Hanko and Nokia. VR’s commuter traffic tickets are not valid on VR’s long-distance trains.

The ticket shall be purchased before boarding the train. During the validity of the ticket, the passenger may change trains. This change shall take place within the validity period of the ticket. The ticket entitles the passenger to travel to the destination station indicated on the ticket even if the validity of the ticket ends before the arrival. 

Single and multi-tickets that have been printed on paper shall be validated with the validator onboard immediately after boarding the train. The journey on a digital multi-ticket shall be activated before boarding the train. A digital single ticket shall be valid when boarding the train. The passenger must have the original ticket. A screenshot, picture or other copy of the ticket is not valid.

### 1.3 Ticket inspection

VR train staff may inspect tickets onboard the train. Passengers must present their tickets when requested. When changing trains, the ticket must also be presented upon request after the change. You must keep your ticket until you arrive at your destination.

If the passenger does not have a valid ticket on their person, they will be considered a ticketless passenger. A ticketless passenger may be removed from the train. VR train staff has the right to impose an inspection fee upon a passenger found to be travelling without an appropriate and valid ticket.

A passenger is also considered to be travelling without a ticket if the inspection reveals that the passenger has a ticket but is travelling with a discount ticket without a certificate proving their right to a discount.

Passengers travelling without a ticket on VR’s commuter trains are required to prove their identity to train personnel. The passenger undertakes to pay the inspection fee imposed by VR. The passenger who been imposed an inspection fee may continue their train trip by purchasing a full-price ticket. In other cases, the conductor has the right to remove a passenger from the train. The conductor has the right to remove a passenger from the train also if the passenger purchases a ticket during the ticket inspection but refuses to provide their personal data for the inspection fee. In this case, the ticket can be used in other train services where the ticket is valid.

An inspection fee may be imposed on passengers travelling without a ticket on VR’s long-distance trains. The passenger may continue their train trip by purchasing a full-price ticket. In other cases, the conductor has the right to remove a passenger from the train.

### 1.4 Discounts

Passengers must have a valid certificate proving their right to a discount with them for the entire journey.

When travelling on a discount ticket, the entitlement to a discount must be proven in ticket inspection in a manner determined by VR. Otherwise it is deemed that the ticket is not valid.

A discount cannot be obtained retroactively.

---------------------------------------------

### 2.1 Luggage

The passenger may carry two pieces of luggage and a handbag, a backpack or a comparable piece of luggage. The passenger shall look after his or her hand luggage and is responsible for it. VR delivers lost property to the lost property office.

Hand luggage shall not inconvenience other passengers or rail traffic or cause damage to, for example, other passengers or luggage. If the passenger fails to adhere to the above, train personnel is authorized to refuse such pieces of luggage.

The passenger is liable for damage caused by his or her hand luggage in accordance with general liability provisions. The liability applies also to cases in which the hand luggage is placed so that the passenger cannot directly monitor it. VR is not liable for any damage caused by loss of or damage to hand luggage, unless the loss or damage is caused by VR’s or its personnel’s negligence or a circumstance referred to in the Rail Traffic Liability Act (5.2.1999/113).

Prams used by families with children and assistance devices used by passengers with reduced mobility can be transported free of charge onboard trains.

The Act on the Transport of Dangerous Goods and the Government Decree on the Transport of Dangerous Goods by Rail govern the transport of dangerous goods. Small amounts of dangerous goods may be carried as hand luggage in trains if the goods are packaged for retail trade and are intended for personal use or for sports and leisure time use and do not cause inconvenience or risk to other passengers or VR.

Firearms may be carried as hand luggage in trains as specified in the Firearms Act, that is, unloaded in a container.

Charging any vehicles or back-up power supplies on the train is strictly prohibited.

Bikes may be transported in designated spaces onboard trains with a luggage car or bike spaces. In InterCity trains and railcars, a space for the bike shall be reserved in advance. Bikes cannot be transported on Pendolino trains. More detailed information on transporting a bicycle can be found [here.](https://www.vr.fi/en/facilities-and-services/bikes-on-trains)

Goods that require a lot of space can be transported as luggage in a separate luggage space on night trains. In this case, a luggage charge is collected. Bike trailers are transported empty and a bicycle fee is charged. Before the journey, customers shall make sure that the transport is possible. Passenger is responsible for the loading of the luggage into the train, its transfer when changing trains and its pick-up at the destination station. With regard to its size, weight and other properties, the luggage shall be of such type that it may be transported without causing danger, damage or unnecessary inconvenience.

### 2.2 Pets

Pets are allowed in designated seats or spaces. If a pet is transported in other than designated seat, the passenger shall protect the seat with a cover. Passenger may travel with pets (and guide, assistance and hearing dogs) in sleeping cabins only in a pet cabin booked entirely for the group. Pets other than dogs shall be transported in pet carriers.

On commuter trains, pets may be transported free of charge in pet cabins. In long-distance trains, a pet charge is collected for the transportation of pets. 

Passenger shall take care of his or her pet during the entire journey. Pets cannot travel alone. 

### 2.3 Children travelling alone

Children travelling alone by train are under the responsibility of their parents. The conductor does not have an obligation to look after children during the journey.

3 Disabled passengers
---------------------

Before the journey, customers shall ensure the availability of the services for disabled passengers. VR offers assistance service on stations that have an assistance point. Information about these stations is available [on accessible train travel webpage](https://www.vr.fi/en/facilities-and-services/accessible-train-travel), in VR’s customer service and in station ticket offices. The assistance service shall be ordered no later than 24 hours before the train’s departure time indicated on the timetable. Assistance devices used by disabled passengers are transported free of charge onboard trains.

An assistant of a disabled passenger may travel free of charge with the disabled person. The assistant shall be capable of assisting the disabled passenger throughout the journey. The assistant shall be over 18 years old. Passenger in a wheelchair does not need any separate certificate for assistants. In other cases, the passenger shall be able to prove the right to an assistant travelling free of charge. In VR’s long-distance traffic, the tickets for the disabled passenger and the assistant shall be purchased at the same time. In VR’s commuter traffic, the person being assisted shall have a valid ticket for the journey. 

For passengers travelling with a guide, assistant or hearing dog, VR recommends service carriages for travelling in long-distance trains. In VR’s commuter traffic, guide, assistant or hearing dogs can be taken in any passenger cabin. On night trains, this is possible only in pet cabins booked entirely for the passenger’s use and accessible sleeping cabins. A separate charge is not collected for guide, assistance or hearing dogs. 

4 Delays
--------

VR’s live train updates are recorded into a system maintained by the Finnish Transport Infrastructure Agency and compensations are based on information received from the system. 

When a train is delayed, compensation may be requested from VR. Rules related to delay compensation have been specified separately for long-distance traffic and commuter traffic. 

In addition, compensation for damage caused by delays not exceeding EUR 5,000 may be requested from VR under the Railway Transport Act.

### 4.1 VR’s long-distance traffic

#### 4.1.1 Compensation or re-routing 

If a train service is cancelled or it is anticipated that arrival at the destination station indicated in the ticket will be over 60 minutes late, the passenger may

1\. demand reimbursement of the ticket price for the journey not made and/or for the part or parts already made if the journey is no longer serving any purpose as well as for the potential return journey

2\. continue their journey or be re-routed, under comparable transport conditions, to the final destination at the earliest opportunity

3\. continue their journey or be re-routed, under comparable transport conditions, to the final destination at a later date.

In items 2 and 3, the passenger is entitled to delay compensation defined under section 4.1.2 However, in item 3, the passenger is not entitled to delay compensation for the delay of the original train service.

In case of a delay of 60 minutes or more, VR shall take all reasonable action to assist the passenger. As far as possible and having regard to the waiting time, this action will include the provision of refreshments and meals during the train journey. If necessary, alternative means of transport shall be organised for them.

If the journey cannot be expected to continue during the same day, VR provides reasonable accommodation, including necessary transport.

VR may also offer alternative transport (bus, taxi, etc.).

#### 4.1.2 Compensation amount

If the passenger arrives at the destination indicated on the train ticket with a delay of 60 minutes or more, the passenger is entitled to receive 25% of the ticket price as compensation from VR. For delays of 120 minutes or more, the passenger is entitled to receive 50% of the ticket price as compensation. The compensation amount does not include fees related to additional services (e.g. surcharges related to seats, pets or bikes).

Possible delays in vehicle loading/unloading are not compensated.

Amounts under EUR 4 will not be paid. 

#### 4.1.3 Delay certificate

Upon request, the onboard personnel of a delayed train will give the passenger a certificate regarding the delay to be attached to the compensation application. 

### 4.2 Compensation to season ticket holders in case of delays in VR’s commuter traffic 

VR’s commuter traffic’s punctuality and operations are monitored by calendar month.  

If VR’s commuter train services are cancelled or delayed by more than 10 minutes during a calendar month so that the trains that are cancelled and delayed by more than 10 minutes together constitute more than 10% of the month’s entire service offering, VR grants VR commuter traffic season ticket holders compensation as follows:

1\. 14–30-day tickets: if even one day of the season ticket’s validity falls on the calendar month in which more than 10% of the month’s entire service offering is cancelled or delayed by more than 10 minutes, passengers is entitled to a 20% compensation of the 14–30-day ticket price.

2\. 31–365-day tickets: if even one day of the season ticket’s validity falls on the calendar month in which more than 10% of the month’s entire service offering is cancelled or delayed by more than 10 minutes, passenger is entitled to a 20% compensation of the 30-day ticket price (delays during one calendar month, i.e. compensation is not paid for longer periods and compensation for delays during a calendar month are compensated only once).

#### 4.3 Compensation for damage caused by delays

VR is liable to compensate passenger for damage caused by a train’s delay, cancellation or not stopping at a traffic point stated in the timetable, at the maximum EUR 5,000 per passenger. However, there is no liability to compensate for a delay that the passenger can reasonably be expected to have anticipated because of the nature of the transport, weather conditions, the time required for transferring to another transport mode or other conditions related to the transport.

To be relieved from liability to compensate, VR is required to prove that it has taken all reasonable measures to prevent the damage.

5 General rules related to compen­sation, injuries and damage
-------------------------------------------------------------

### 5.1 Personal injuries

In personal injuries, VR makes statutory advance payments to passengers or their dependants to cover immediate economic needs. The advance payments shall be proportional to the damage caused. VR is liable to the full amount of personal injury.

An amount of EUR 21,000 per passenger will be paid in advance in the case of death. In the case of injury, relevant and reasonable costs up to EUR 21,000 per passenger will be paid in advance.

Advance payments do not constitute recognition of liability and will be offset against any subsequent compensation paid. A demand may be made for the advance payment to be returned if the loss or damage was caused by the negligence or fault of the passenger or where the person who received the advance payment was not the person entitled to compensation.

Upon request, VR shall provide reasonable support for pursuing claims for injury-related compensation against third parties. This support may not conflict with VR’s own interests.

Compensation for personal injuries shall be requested from VR within three years of the moment when the injured party became or should have become aware of the injury. However, compensation shall be requested at the latest within ten years of the injury.

### 5.2 Loss and damage to property

Under the Rail Traffic Liability Act, VR is liable to the full amount for passenger’s clothes, luggage carried and animals that are damaged. 

If the passenger notices, when receiving luggage, any damage to or loss of luggage, the passenger shall inform VR of this when receiving the registered luggage. In other case, the customer shall submit the notification within a reasonable amount of time after receiving the luggage. 

The right to compensation is lost if the claim for damages is not submitted in writing to VR within a year or, if the damage has been caused intentionally or due to gross negligence by VR or a party that VR is responsible for, within three years.

Within a month, VR shall provide a response or inform the passenger of the date by which the response can be expected.

### 5.3 Compensation applications and the processing time

A compensation application form can be found at the [vr.fi website](https://www.vr.fi/en/compensation). A compensation request can also be submitted at a ticket office or by calling our [customer service number](https://www.vr.fi/en/customer-service), after which the customer will be sent a printed compensation application form.

The VR Corporate Customer Account is used with a customer ID provided by VR. The Customer is responsible for ensuring that the ID is distributed and used securely throughout its organisation. VR is entitled to charge the Customer for all purchases made using the customer ID. VR shall not separately verify the purchaser’s right to use the customer ID. VR grants contractual discounts based on its criteria valid at the given time. The contractual discount applicable and the ticket products covered by the discount are specified according to the valid service price list. Contractual discount is only applicable to the Customer’s purchases made using the customer ID in the separately defined transaction channels. The transaction channels covered by the VR Corporate Customer Account are listed on VR’s website at www.vr.fi. Contractual discount is calculated at the moment of making the transaction and the discount is applied to the product’s price. VR reserves the right to change the contractual discount as well as the products and transaction channels to which it can be applied.

The primary payment method is credit card. When paying with a credit card, the terms of payment outlined in the contract between the Customer and its credit card company apply.

The term of payment is fourteen (14) days of the invoice date, unless separately agreed otherwise. The notice period is eight (8) days of the invoice date. The interest on arrears is determined by current interest legislation.
