The body-worn camera will show that it is recording with an indicator light and sound.

Personal data is disclosed, to the extent permitted by law, to the Finnish Transport Agency and, upon request, to other authorities. Data can be disclosed to companies belonging to the same group in order to present legal claims and to insurance companies for processing accident cases.

We use external parties to support the processing of personal data in the maintenance and development of IT systems and safety monitoring room duties, for instance. These service providers process personal data commissioned by us and on our behalf.

The data processing follows current legislation and is always carried out in accordance with this data protection notice. This is ensured, among other things, through contracts between the organizations.

8 Transfer or disclosure of data outside the EU or the EEA
----------------------------------------------------------

Data will not be disclosed outside the EU or the European Economic Area or outside countries which the European Commission considers to have an adequate level of data protection, unless the adequate level of data protection has been ensured with contracts or in another manner required by law.

9 Data retention period
-----------------------

Normally, camera recordings are stored for one month at the maximum. However, data may be stored for a longer time, if necessary (upon authorities’ request, for instance).
