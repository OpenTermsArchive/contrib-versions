If you come to our Sites from a different device or from a different browser on the same device, you will need to apply GPC for that browser and/or device as well.

* Services and support;
* Analytics and improvement;

**Sensitive Personal Information**. We do not collect, use, or disclose "sensitive personal information" beyond the purposes authorized by the CCPA. Accordingly, we only use and disclose sensitive personal information as reasonably necessary and proportionate: (i) to perform our services requested by you; (ii) to help ensure security and integrity, including to prevent, detect, and investigate security incidents; (iii) to detect, prevent and respond to malicious, fraudulent, deceptive, or illegal conduct; (iv) to verify or maintain the quality and safety of our services; (v) for compliance with our legal obligations; (vi) to our service providers who perform services on our behalf; and (vii) for purposes other than inferring characteristics about you.

**Retention**. We retain the personal information we collect only as reasonably necessary for the purposes described above or otherwise disclosed to you at the time of collection. For example, we will retain your account information for as long as you have an active account with us and additional information as necessary to comply with our tax, accounting and recordkeeping obligations, to provide you with the services you have requested, as well as an additional period of time as necessary to protect, defend or establish our rights, defend against potential claims, and comply with our legal obligations. In some cases, rather than delete your personal information, we may deidentify or aggregate it and use it in compliance with the CCPA.

**Sales and Sharing of Personal Information**. The CCPA defines "sale" as disclosing or making available personal information to a third-party in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration, and "sharing" includes disclosing or making available personal information to a third-party for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising. While we do not disclose personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary compensation, we may "sell" or "share" the following categories of personal information: identifiers; commercial information; location data; and Internet and network activity information. We may disclose these categories to third-party advertising networks, analytics providers, and social networks for purposes of marketing and advertising and to improve and measure our ad campaigns. We do not sell or share sensitive personal information, nor do we sell or share personal information about individuals we know are under age sixteen (16).

**California Privacy Rights**. The CCPA provides California residents with specific rights regarding personal information. Subject to certain conditions and exceptions, California residents have the following rights with respect to their personal information:

* **Right to Know**. You have the right to request: (i) the categories or personal information we collected about you; (ii) the categories of sources from which the personal information is collected; (iii) our business or commercial purposes for collecting, selling, or sharing personal information; (iv) the categories of third parties to whom we have disclosed personal information; and (v) a copy of the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.
    
* **Right to Delete**. You have the right to request we delete personal information we have collected from you.
    
* **Right to Correct**. You have the right to request that we correct inaccuracies in your personal information.
    
* **Right to Opt-Out of Sales and Sharing**. You have the right to opt-out of "sales" and "sharing" of your personal information, as those terms are defined under the CCPA.
    
* **Right to Limit Use and Disclosure**. You have the right to limit use and disclose of your sensitive personal information. However, we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information beyond the purposes authorized by the CCPA; thus, this right is not available to California residents.
    
* **Right to Non-Discrimination**. You have the right not to be subjected to discriminatory treatment for exercising any of the rights described in this section.
    

**Submitting CCPA Requests**. California residents may exercise their CCPA privacy rights as set forth below:

* **Right to Know, Delete, and Correct**. California residents may submit CCPA requests to access/know, delete, and correct their personal by contacting us at [support@themeetgroup.com](mailto:support@themeetgroup.com).

When you submit a request, we will take steps to verify your identity and request by matching the information provided by you with the information we have in our records. In some cases, we may request additional information in order to verify your identity, or where necessary to process your request. If we are unable to verify your identity after a good faith attempt, we may deny the request and, if so, will explain the basis for the denial.

You may also designate someone as an authorized agent to submit requests and act on your behalf. Authorized agents will be required to provide proof of their authorization in their first communication with us, and we may also require that the relevant consumer directly verify their identity and the authority of the authorized agent.

* **Right to Opt-Out of Sales and Sharing**. To exercise your right to opt-out of the "sale" or "sharing" of your personal information, you may do so via our cookie preference manager. We will apply your opt out based upon the personal information in our records that is linked or reasonably linkable to the information provided in your request. You may also click the "_Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information_" link at the bottom of our Sites and in our Mobile App.

In addition, if we detect that your browser or device is transmitting an opt-out preference signal, such as the "global privacy control" (or GPC) signal, we will opt that browser or device out of cookies that result in a "sale" or "sharing" of your personal information. If you come to our Sites or use our Services from a different device or from a different browser on the same device, you will need to opt-out, or use an opt-out preference signal, for that browser and/or device as well. More information about GPC is available at: [https://globalprivacycontrol.org/](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/).

**Notice of Financial Incentive**. With respect to some of our Services, TMG may make available certain programs or offerings, and other sweepstakes, contests, or similar promotional offerings (each a "Program") which may include certain offers, rewards, discounts, services, perks, and promotions ("Rewards and Offers"). These Programs may be considered "financial incentives" under the CCPA. We provide these Rewards and Offers to participating users in order to understand and improve customer satisfaction and experiences, and to foster positive customer relationships.

As a basis for offering these Rewards and Offers, we have valued the personal information we obtain based on a reasonable and good faith calculation determined by considering expenses related to the Programs. In doing so, we value the personal information collected through the programs as the equivalent of the costs and expenses incurred to provide the program, including IT, administration, direct costs, third party costs, discounts, and service development costs.

Your personal information is collected and retained, and may be disclosed to our business partners, vendors and service providers, and other third parties, as described in this Policy, including in order (i) to administer the Program, (ii) for research and analytics purposes, (iii) to improve our products and services, (iv) to better reach you with more relevant, targeted offers, and (v) to send you TMG news, updates and offers by email, postal mail, and text message (in accordance with your communications preferences).

You may withdraw from participating in a Program at any time by contacting us using the methods described in this Policy. Please note that if you withdraw from a Program (or submit a CCPA request to delete your Program information), your participation in that Program will be terminated, which means that you will no longer be eligible to earn, use, access or redeem any Program Rewards and Offers, subject to the applicable Program terms.

**California's Shine the Light Law**. Under California's "Shine the Light" law (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.83), California residents who provide us certain personal information are entitled to request and obtain from us, free of charge, information about the personal information (if any) we have shared with third parties for their own direct marketing use. Such requests may be made once per calendar year for information about any relevant third-party sharing in the prior calendar year. To submit a "Shine the Light" request, you may contact us by using the methods described in this Policy. Please include in your request a current California address and your attestation that you are a California resident.
