The Meet Group Copyright Agent 100 Union Square Drive, New Hope, PA 18938 (215) 862-1162 [copyright@themeetgroup.com](mailto:copyright@themeetgroup.com)

5. Your address, telephone number, and email address; and
    
6. Your physical or electronic signature.
    

The Company's Agent will forward this information to the alleged infringer. It is Company's policy to terminate the accounts of repeat infringers.

### **L) GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE.**

Unless prohibited by local law, this Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Arbitration Agreement of this Agreement (below) shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. Any action to compel arbitration, or challenging the enforceability or applicability of the arbitration provisions herein, must be filed in the federal or state courts of Delaware. Any action filed in any other court shall be transferred to, or dismissed without prejudice for refiling only in, the federal or state courts of Delaware, after removal to the appropriate federal court, if applicable, for determination by the Delaware federal or state court as to whether the action should be stayed pending, or otherwise referred to, arbitration. Any claims that are not referred to arbitration must be adjudicated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Delaware. For such claims, the federal and state courts of Delaware shall have exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue over you and us, and you and we waive any objection based on inconvenient forum. If either party files suit in any court other than the federal or state courts of Delaware, in deciding whether to transfer or dismiss the action, or otherwise give effect to this provision, the court shall apply the standard set forth in Atlantic Marine Construction Co. v. U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, 571 U.S. 49 (2013). The parties also agree that transfer or dismissal cannot be denied based on inconvenience to the parties, piecemeal adjudication of the claims, a risk of inconsistent findings of law or fact, the presence of other parties who are not party to these terms, or any other private or public consideration.

You agree that regardless of any law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to the Company Services and/or this Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.

Nothing in this Agreement is intended to limit a party’s right to seek equitable relief. If the Arbitration Agreement (as set forth below) is held to be unenforceable, you and we agree that any claims or disputes that you or we have against each other must be resolved in the federal or state courts located in Delaware to the extent permissible by applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims appropriately brought in small claims court may be filed in any court of competent jurisdiction. **For the sake of clarity, the choice of Delaware law shall not exclude, limit or supersede a consumer’s rights or remedies under mandatory consumer protection laws in the jurisdiction where the consumer resides.**

### **M) ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, CLASS ACTION WAIVER AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER.**

**Purpose**: This section of the Agreement (henceforth referred to as “Arbitration Agreement”) facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any Disputes that may arise between you and The Meet Group, Inc. Arbitration is a form of private Dispute (as defined below) resolution in which parties to a contract agree to submit their Disputes and potential Disputes to a neutral third person (called an arbitrator) for a binding decision, instead of having such Dispute(s) decided in a lawsuit, in court, by a judge or jury trial.

Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It provides that all Disputes between you and The Meet Group, Inc. shall be resolved by binding arbitration. **Arbitration replaces the right to go to court. In the absence of this Arbitration Agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions). Entering into this Arbitration Agreement constitutes a waiver of your and our right to litigate claims in court and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury.** There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow this Arbitration Agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney’s fees, if otherwise authorized by applicable law).

For the purpose of this Arbitration Agreement, “Tagged” means the Meet Group, Inc. and its parents, subsidiaries, and affiliated companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents. The term “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Tagged regarding any aspect of your relationship with Tagged, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, gross negligence or reckless behavior), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Arbitration Agreement (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver in this Arbitration Agreement). “Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced.

YOU AND TAGGED EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.

**Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution:** For all Disputes, you and we must first give each other an opportunity to resolve the Dispute before commencing arbitration. You must commence any Dispute you have with us by mailing written notification to The Meet Group, Inc., 100 Union Square Drive, New Hope, PA 18938, USA. That written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) your phone number, (4) your email address used to create your Tagged account, (5) a written description of the Dispute, (6) a description of the specific relief you seek, and (7) your personal signature. If Tagged does not resolve the Dispute to your satisfaction within 45 days after it receives your written notification, you may pursue your Dispute in arbitration. We must commence any Dispute we have with you by sending you a written notification to the email address used to create your Tagged account that includes a written description of the Dispute and a description of the specific relief we seek. If the Dispute is not resolved to our satisfaction within 45 days after you receive our written notification, we may pursue our Dispute in arbitration. Either party may communicate directly with the other in an effort to satisfy or resolve any Dispute, including by communicating any offers or demands.

**Arbitration Procedures:** If this Arbitration Agreement applies and the Dispute is not resolved as provided above (“Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution”) either you or Tagged may initiate arbitration proceedings. The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/) will arbitrate all Disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration, and shall in no event be commenced as a representative or class arbitration. However, this shall not preclude the application of the Mass Filing section below. All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Arbitration Agreement.

For arbitration before the AAA, for Disputes of less than $75,000 USD, the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules will apply; for Disputes involving $75,000 USD or more, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. In either instance, the AAA’s Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall apply. The AAA rules are available at [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/) or by calling 1-800-778-7879. This Arbitration Agreement governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules. Under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration. However, this shall not preclude the application of the **Mass Filing** section below.

In the event of a mass filing (defined in the section titled **Mass Filing** below), the procedures, fees, and costs described in the Mass Filing section will govern notwithstanding any applicable rule of the arbitration provider to the contrary.

Because your contract with Tagged, the Agreement, and this Arbitration Agreement concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all Disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.

**Arbitration Award:** The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The arbitrator shall make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. Such award by the arbitrator will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.

**Location of Arbitration:** The arbitration may be heard in Delaware, as otherwise required by the arbitration provider’s rules, or in another location mutually agreed to by the parties. The parties may appear via teleconference as though they were appearing in person unless otherwise ordered by the arbitrator.

**Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs:** The initiating party must pay all filing fees that the arbitration provider requires to be paid by the initiating party. Your and our responsibility to pay other administrative and arbitrator fees and costs will also be as set forth in the applicable arbitration provider’s rules, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. If a claim is determined to be frivolous, the claimant is responsible for reimbursing the respondent for its portion of all such administrative, hearing, filing, and/or other fees incurred as a result of the frivolous claim. The arbitration provider may also impose such obligation on the claimant’s attorneys. Fees, costs, and sanctions may also be awarded in the arbitration against a party of a party’s attorney as provided pursuant to applicable law. You may qualify for a waiver of certain arbitration costs under the arbitration provider’s rules or other applicable law. If you meet the standard for proceeding in forma pauperis in federal court, Delaware state court, or the courts of your state of residence, cannot obtain a waiver from the arbitration provider of any filing fees you are required to pay, and the arbitration provider refuses to administer the arbitration without your payment of said fees, Tagged will pay the filing fees for you.

**Class Action Waiver:** The parties agree that the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, representative action, consolidated action or private attorney general action), except as set forth in the Mass Filing section below, unless both you and Tagged specifically agree in writing to do so following initiation of the arbitration. Neither you, nor any other member or user of the Tagged and hi5 services, can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, representative, consolidated or private attorney general proceeding, except as set forth in the Mass Filing section below.

**Limitation of Procedural Rights:** You understand and agree that, by entering into this Arbitration Agreement, you and Tagged are each agreeing to arbitration instead of the right to a trial before a judge or jury in a public court. In the absence of this Arbitration Agreement, you and Tagged might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring Disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions). You and we give up those rights. Other rights that you or we would have if you or we went to court, such as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more limited in arbitration. The right to appellate review of an arbitrator’s decision is much more limited than in court, and in general an arbitrator’s decision may not be appealed for errors of fact or law.

**Severability:** If any clause within this Arbitration Agreement (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above and Mass Filing clause below) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Arbitration Agreement, and the remainder of this Arbitration Agreement will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver or Mass Filing clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then this entire Arbitration Agreement will be unenforceable, and the Dispute will be decided by a court.

**Continuation:** This Arbitration Agreement shall survive the termination of your contract with Tagged and your use of the Tagged and hi5 services.

**Mass Filing:** If, at any time, 25 or more similar demands for arbitration are asserted against us or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities, or if we assert 25 or more similar demands for arbitration or counterclaims against similarly situated parties, within a period of 60 days or otherwise close in proximity (“Mass Filing”), the additional protocols set forth below shall apply:

* **Acknowledgment of Mass Filing Protocols.** If you or we, or you or our counsel, files a demand for arbitration that fits within the definition of Mass Filing referred to above, then you and we agree that the demand for arbitration shall be subject to the additional protocols set forth in this Mass Filing subsection. If the parties disagree as to whether a series of filings fits within the definition of Mass Filing above, the arbitration provider shall resolve the disagreement. You and we also acknowledge that the adjudication of the dispute may be delayed and that any applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled from the time of filing of the demand for arbitration, and pending resolution of the bellwether proceedings.
    
* **Bellwether Arbitrations.** Bellwether proceedings are encouraged by courts and arbitration administrators where there are multiple disputes involving similar claims against the same or related parties. The parties shall select ten individual arbitration claims (five per side), designated the “Initial Test Cases,” to proceed to arbitration. Only the Initial Test Cases shall be filed with the arbitrator. All other claims shall be held in abeyance. This means that the filing fees will be paid only for the Initial Test Cases; for all other demands for arbitration in a Mass Filing, the filing fees (together with any arbitrator consideration of the other demands) will be in abeyance, and neither you nor Tagged will be required to pay any such filing fees. You and Tagged also agree that neither you nor we shall be deemed to be in breach of this Arbitration Agreement for failure to pay any such filing fees, and that neither you nor we shall be entitled to any contractual, statutory, or other remedies, damages, or sanctions of any kind for failure to pay any such filing fees. If, pursuant to this subsection, a party files non-Bellwether Arbitrations with the arbitration provider, the parties agree that the arbitration provider shall hold those demands in abeyance and not refer them to the arbitrator pending resolution of the Initial Test Cases. Unless the claims are resolved in advance or the schedule is extended, the arbitrators will render a final award for the Initial Test Cases within 120 days of the initial pre-hearing conference.
    
* **Global Mediation.** Following the resolution of the Initial Test Cases, the parties agree to engage in a global mediation of all the remaining individual arbitration claims comprising the Mass Filing (“Global Mediation”), deferring any filing costs associated with the non-Initial Test Cases until the Initial Test Cases and subsequent Global Mediation have concluded. After the final awards are provided to the mediator in the Initial Test Cases, the mediator and the parties shall have 90 days to agree upon a substantive methodology and make an offer to resolve the outstanding cases. If the Parties are unable to resolve the outstanding claims during the Global Mediation, the remaining claims shall proceed in court unless the parties agree to an alternative procedure. You and we also acknowledge that any applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled pending resolution of the global mediation process.
    
* **Arbitration Provider’s Authority to Apply Mass Filing Rules.** Notwithstanding this Mass Filing section, if a series of arbitration demands is determined by the arbitration provider not to constitute a Mass Filing pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement, but such demands constitute a mass filing pursuant to the arbitration provider’s mass filing rules, the arbitration provider may apply its mass filing rules, procedures, and fees.
    
* **Enforcement of Subsection.** A Court of competent jurisdiction located in federal or state court in Delaware shall have the power to enforce this Mass Filing section.

2.2. Once you have successfully registered, you will be able to access our free-of-charge Service ("Basic Membership").

2.3. We also offer various services or features that are subject to a fee. Before you sign up to purchase such services or features, we will provide you with further information about what you will be purchasing, for example, where applicable: the main characteristics of the services or features, the term of your subscription (including any extension), how to terminate your subscription, the price and any payment conditions and limitations of means of payment. In case you purchase Virtual Goods (see Clause 3.3 below), we will further inform you that these are redeemable only on the Service for digital merchandise and content and that they are not refundable. If you want to upgrade your Basic Membership by choosing a membership that is subject to a fee ("Premium Membership"), or access any other services or features subject to a fee, you acknowledge that by pressing the "Buy now"-button (or comparable button), you will have confirmed that you want to purchase the Premium Membership or other services or features that you have selected.

1.1. Una vez que te hayas registrado para obtener una cuenta, te proporcionaremos acceso a una plataforma en línea a través de la cual podrás conocer a otros clientes registrados (también conocidos como miembros). Únicamente se puede acceder al Servicio a través de aplicaciones móviles en dispositivos iOS y Android (aunque, en el futuro, podrían estar disponibles otros sistemas operativos), o a través de nuestro sitio web Tagged y/o Hi5 (ten en cuenta que algunas funciones solo estarán disponibles a través de la aplicación móvil o la web); y el Servicio incluye algunos servicios que son gratuitos y otros que son de pago.

1.2. El Servicio contiene "perfiles" de miembros, que incluyen contenidos (también denominados "datos") puestos a disposición por dichos miembros. También puedes encontrar más detalles sobre los tipos de información personal que se recopilan y cómo se pone esta información a disposición de otros miembros en nuestra [Política de Privacidad](https://secure.hi5.com/terms_of_service.html?#privacy_policy) (consulta la Cláusula 5 más adelante). Ofrecemos nuestro Servicio globalmente; y es posible que nuestros miembros busquen y contacten a otros miembros en cualquiera de los países en los que operamos.

**2\. Acceso al servicio y conclusión de tu suscripción**

2.1. Para acceder al Servicio y usarlo, deberás registrarte. Para ello, tendrás que elegir una opción de registro disponible, como correo electrónico, SMS, Iniciar sesión con Apple, Iniciar sesión con Google o Facebook, y proporcionar credenciales de inicio de sesión, como dirección de correo electrónico y una contraseña de tu elección. Serás responsable de mantener la confidencialidad de tu contraseña y de las credenciales de tu cuenta. Además, serás responsable de todas y cada una de las actividades causadas culpablemente que se produzcan en tu cuenta. Te comprometes a notificarnos inmediatamente cualquier uso no autorizado de tu cuenta o cualquier otra violación de la seguridad en cuanto tengas conocimiento de ello.

2.2. Una vez que te hayas registrado correctamente, podrás acceder a nuestro Servicio gratuito ("Membresía Básica").

2.3. También ofrecemos varios servicios o funciones que están sujetos a una tarifa. Antes de que te registres para comprar dichos servicios o funciones, te proporcionaremos más información sobre lo que vas a comprar, por ejemplo, cuando proceda: las características principales de los servicios o funciones, el plazo de tu suscripción (incluida cualquier prórroga), cómo finalizar tu suscripción, el precio y cualquier condición de pago y limitaciones de los medios de pago. En caso de que adquieras Bienes Virtuales (consulta la Cláusula 3.3 más adelante), te informaremos además de que estos solo son canjeables en el Servicio por mercancías y contenidos digitales y que no son reembolsables. Si quieres mejorar tu Membresía Básica eligiendo una membresía de pago ("Membresía Premium"), o acceder a otros servicios o funciones de pago, reconoces que, al tocar el botón "Comprar ahora" (o un botón similar), habrás confirmado que quieres comprar la Membresía Premium u otros servicios o funciones que hayas seleccionado. Nuestra relación contractual para dichas compras se confirmará en la fecha en que recibas una confirmación de tu pedido. No obstante, ten en cuenta que el cumplimiento de tu obligación de pago con nosotros está sujeto a que el proveedor de servicios de pago correspondiente verifique y procese la compra.

Sin embargo, cualquier compra y/o suscripción se concluye (y debe cancelarse o rescindirse) únicamente a través de Apple/Google (consulta la Cláusula 5.3), y está sujeta a las normas y principios técnicos establecidos por Apple/Google, sobre los que no tenemos ningún control. Por regla general, una compra a través de una tienda de aplicaciones tendrá lugar cuando hagas clic en "Comprar ahora" (o un botón similar) y, cuando sea necesario, introduzcas tu contraseña o credenciales equivalentes (por ejemplo, Touch ID o Face ID) para la tienda de aplicaciones. Tu relación contractual con Apple/Google quedará confirmada en la fecha en que Apple/Google te envíe un correo electrónico de confirmación de tu pedido; y Apple/Google te facturará cualquier cargo de Membresía Premium a través de tu cuenta de Apple/Google. También encontrarás en la App Store toda la información esencial que necesites sobre tu relación contractual con Apple/Google. Si adquieres una Membresía Premium a través de la App Store que está sujeta a prórroga automática, la Membresía Premium tendrá una duración determinada, que se prorrogará automáticamente a menos que canceles tu suscripción con Apple/Google de acuerdo con los Términos de Uso de Apple/Google.

3.3. Sie können „virtuelle Güter“ ausschließlich zur Nutzung im Rahmen des Service erwerben (z. B. virtuelles „Gold“). Käufe oder sonstige Formen des Erwerbs virtueller Güter berechtigen nur zu einer begrenzten, nicht übertragbaren, nicht unterlizenzierbaren, vollumfänglich widerrufbaren Lizenz zur Nutzung solcher virtuellen Güter für den Zugriff auf Dienste, die wir ausdrücklich zur privaten, nichtkommerziellen Nutzung in Verbindung mit solchen virtuellen Gütern zur Verfügung stellen (z. B. Live-Animationen, sog. virtuelle „Geschenke“). Virtuelle Güter können nur im Rahmen des Service gegen digitale Waren und Inhalte eingelöst werden. Virtuelle Güter verfallen nicht. Virtuelle Güter sind nicht erstattungsfähig. Virtuelle Güter haben keinen Geldwert und stellen keine Währung oder Eigentum jeglicher Art dar. Virtuelle Güter sind nicht übertragbar oder abtretbar. Sie haben keinen Anspruch auf Rückerstattung, Zahlung von Geldbeträgen oder eine andere Entschädigung für ungenutzte virtuelle Güter, wenn ein Konto aufgrund eines schwerwiegenden Verstoßes Ihrerseits gegen diese Nutzungsbedingungen geschlossen wird oder wenn Sie sich entscheiden, Ihr Konto zu schließen.

3.4. Sie können virtuelle Güter verwenden, um Geschenke für andere Benutzer unserer App oder anderer Apps zu kaufen, die Ihnen angezeigt werden. Der Preis für das jeweilige Geschenk wird beim Kauf angezeigt. Geschenke gewähren eine begrenzte Lizenz für den Zugriff auf eine bestimmte Funktion des Service.

3.5. Es steht uns überdies frei, in unregelmäßigen Abständen bestimmte zusätzliche Dienste anzubieten, darunter Shopping- und E-Commerce-Angebote sowie verschiedene Informationsdienste.

3.6. Es steht uns frei, Änderungen an dem Service vorzunehmen: (i) um Änderungen der geltenden Gesetze und behördlichen Auflagen Rechnung zu tragen; oder (ii) um kleinere technische Anpassungen und Verbesserungen vorzunehmen, beispielsweise zur Abwehr einer Sicherheitsbedrohung (Ihre Nutzung des Service wird durch diese Änderungen jedoch nicht beeinträchtigt). Darüber hinaus veröffentlichen wir zwar eine Beschreibung unseres Service auf unserer Website, können jedoch die Hauptmerkmale des Service in unregelmäßigen Abständen ändern, ohne dass für Sie zusätzliche Kosten entstehen. In diesem Fall informieren wir Sie hierüber jedoch innerhalb einer angemessenen Frist vor Inkrafttreten einer derartigen Änderung, und es steht Ihnen dann frei, uns innerhalb von 30 Tagen, nachdem Sie über eine derartige Änderung informiert wurden, zu kontaktieren, um Ihr Abonnement zu kündigen, sofern die Änderung Ihren Zugriff auf die Dienste oder Ihre Nutzung der Dienste beeinträchtigt und sofern es sich nicht um eine geringfügige Beeinträchtigung handelt, die nur vor Inkrafttreten der Änderungen eintritt (und sofern Sie über uns eine Premium-Mitgliedschaft abonniert haben, erhalten Sie von uns eine anteilige Rückerstattung für Leistungen, die Sie bezahlt, jedoch wegen der vorzeitigen Kündigung Ihres Abonnements nicht erhalten haben). In jeder derartigen Mitteilung werden Sie über die Art und die Gründe für eine solche Änderung, den Zeitpunkt, zu dem die Änderung in Kraft tritt, sowie Ihr Recht informiert, das Abonnement innerhalb von 30 Tagen nach der Benachrichtigung gemäß diesem Abschnitt 3.6 zu kündigen.

**4\. Datennutzung**

4.1. Weitere Informationen zu unserer Verwendung bzw. sonstigen Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten und zu unseren datenschutzrechtlichen Verpflichtungen entnehmen Sie auch unserer [Privacy Policy](https://secure.hi5.com/terms_of_service.html?#privacy_policy).

4.2. Wir sind ständig bestrebt, Sie vor Belästigungen wie Hacker-Angriffen, Spam oder Romance-Scams zu schützen. Zu diesem Zweck haben wir zahlreiche technische und organisatorische Standards entwickelt. Es liegt in Ihrer Verantwortung, die Benutzerrichtlinien gemäß dem nachstehenden Abschnitt 8 einzuhalten. Bei Unregelmäßigkeiten werden Sie möglicherweise von unserem für Vertrauen und Sicherheit zuständigen Team kontaktiert, damit diese Unregelmäßigkeiten behoben werden können. In diesem Fall legen wir die Gründe für die Kontaktaufnahme mit Ihnen im Einzelnen dar und Sie sind verpflichtet, mit einer solchen Anfrage zu kooperieren und innerhalb einer angemessenen Frist darauf zu antworten. Etwaige Handlungsempfehlungen unsererseits sollten Sie gründlich prüfen. Sollten Sie eine empfohlene Maßnahme ablehnen, sind Sie dazu verpflichtet, uns innerhalb einer angemessenen Frist unter Angabe der Gründe für die Ablehnung unserer Handlungsempfehlung informieren. Ebenfalls sollten Sie problematische Inhalte oder Verhaltensweisen über die Meldefunktion an uns melden.

4.3. Es steht uns frei, unbeantwortete Nachrichten, die von oder an Profile gesendet wurden, die als Spam oder Romance-Scam identifiziert wurden oder anderweitig gelöscht wurden, automatisch zu löschen.

**5\. Kündigung/Verlängerung**

**Bitte beachten Sie Abschnitt 11, wenn Sie von Ihrem Widerrufsrecht Gebrauch machen und Ihre Premium-Mitgliedschaft innerhalb der 14-tägigen Widerrufsfrist kündigen möchten.**

5.1. Es steht Ihnen frei, Ihre Basis-Mitgliedschaft jederzeit mit sofortiger Wirkung über Ihre Kontoeinstellungen oder durch Kontaktaufnahme mit uns ([support@themeetgroup.com](mailto:support@themeetgroup.com)) zu kündigen.

5.2. Wenn Sie im Rahmen Ihrer Basis-Mitgliedschaft über aktive virtuelle Güter verfügen, müssen Sie uns per E-Mail an [support@themeetgroup.com](mailto:support@themeetgroup.com) über die Kündigung informieren. Bitte geben Sie dabei die mit Ihrem Konto verknüpfte E-Mail-Adresse oder ähnliche Anmeldedaten an, damit wir Sie identifizieren können.

5.3. Wenn Sie Ihre Premium-Mitgliedschaft zu einem beliebigen Zeitpunkt kündigen möchten, steht Ihnen das jederzeit frei. Wenn die Gebühren für Ihre Premium-Mitgliedschaft über unsere Website in Rechnung gestellt werden, müssen Sie spätestens drei Tage vor Fälligkeit Ihrer nächsten automatischen Zahlung unter [http://www.hi5.com/account\_info.html](http://www.hi5.com/account_info.html) die Registerkarte „Abonnements und Zahlungen anklicken, „Abonnement kündigen“ auswählen und „Premium kündigen“ anklicken, damit wir Ihre Kündigung ordnungsgemäß bearbeiten können. Wenn Sie diese Frist nicht einhalten, steht es Ihnen dennoch frei, Ihr Abonnement zum Ende der jeweiligen Laufzeit zu kündigen; jedoch ziehen wir dann unter Umständen die Gebühr für den folgenden Abrechnungszeitraum ein, die wir Ihnen dann rückerstatten. Ihr Recht auf Kündigung Ihrer Premium-Mitgliedschaft aus anderen Gründen bleibt hiervon unberührt. In diesem Fall müssen Sie die Gründe für die außerordentliche Kündigung angeben, wenn Sie Ihr Abonnement aus diesem Grund kündigen. Wenn die Abrechnung über Apple erfolgt, müssen Sie Ihre Premium-Mitgliedschaft spätestens 24 Stunden vor Fälligkeit Ihrer nächsten automatischen Zahlung kündigen, indem Sie die [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039) bereitgestellten Anweisungen befolgen. Wenn die Abrechnung über Google Play erfolgt, müssen Sie Ihre Premium-Mitgliedschaft innerhalb von sieben Tagen ab Beginn Ihres Abrechnungszyklus kündigen, indem Sie die [**here**](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481) bereitgestellten Anweisungen befolgen. Sie können uns auch über die nachstehend in Abschnitt 16 bereitgestellten Kontaktangaben postalisch benachrichtigen. Vorbehaltlich der nachstehenden Abschnitte 5.5 und 11 wird eine Kündigung Ihres Abonnements erst zum Ende des jeweiligen Abrechnungszeitraums wirksam (und Sie haben daher keinen Anspruch auf Rückerstattung). Um zu verhindern, dass sich Ihre Premium-Mitgliedschaft automatisch verlängert, müssen Sie uns vor Ende der jeweiligen Laufzeit Ihres Abonnements mitteilen, dass Sie Ihr Abonnement kündigen wollen.

5.4. Wenn Sie Ihr Basis- oder Premium-Mitgliedskonto löschen, werden zuvor erworbene virtuelle Güter ebenfalls gelöscht, während bestehende Zahlungsverpflichtungen aus dem Kauf kostenpflichtiger Dienste oder Funktionen (wie virtuelle Güter) bestehen bleiben, vorbehaltlich der geltenden Kündigungsrechte (siehe Abschnitt 12).

5.5. Zur Authentifizierung Ihrer Identität und Ihres Kündigungsantrags müssen Sie dabei die mit Ihrem Konto verknüpfte E-Mail-Adresse oder andere Angaben zu Ihrer Person bereitstellen, damit wir Sie identifizieren können.

5.6. Wenn Sie sich für den Erwerb einer Premium-Mitgliedschaft entscheiden, verlängert sich Ihre Mitgliedschaft automatisch auf monatlicher Basis, sofern Sie sie nicht gemäß den Bestimmungen dieses Abschnitts kündigen.

5.7. Wenn Sie Ihre Premium-Mitgliedschaft kündigen, wird Ihr Konto auf eine Basis-Mitgliedschaft zurückgesetzt. Wenn Sie Ihre Basis-Mitgliedschaft kündigen möchten, befolgen Sie bitte das in Abschnitt 5.1 beschriebene Verfahren.

5.8. Vorbehaltlich Abschnitt 5.4 und in Übereinstimmung mit Abschnitt 3.6 gelten folgende Bestimmungen, wenn Sie Ihre Premium-Mitgliedschaft kündigen wollen, weil wir Sie über eine bevorstehende wesentliche Änderung an unserem Service benachrichtigt haben: Ihr Abonnement endet sofort, nachdem wir Ihre Kündigung in Schriftform erhalten haben (z. B. per E-Mail oder Fax), und wir erstatten Ihnen die anteiligen Gebühren für nicht erbrachte Leistungen im Rahmen Ihrer Premium-Mitgliedschaft. Wenn Sie Ihre Premium-Mitgliedschaft über Apple/Google erworben haben, erfolgen etwaige Kündigungen und Rückerstattungen gemäß den Bedingungen von Apple/Google, wie in den Abschnitten 2.4 und 5.3 näher erläutert.

**6\. Funktionalität, Kompatibilität, Interoperabilität, Garantien und Haftung**

6.1. Bitte beachten Sie, dass wir uns zwar im Rahmen des Möglichen bemühen, die jederzeitige Verfügbarkeit des Service jedoch nicht garantieren können. Die Verfügbarkeit des Service kann aufgrund anfallender Wartungsarbeiten und Software-Updates eingeschränkt werden sowie aufgrund technischer oder anderer Probleme, die sich unserer Kontrolle entziehen.

6.2. Einige Funktionen sind ausschließlich über die Website bzw. über die App verfügbar. Über die Mobile App ist z. B. kein Zugriff auf Funktionen wie Tags, Herzen und die benutzerspezifische Anpassung von Web-Profilen möglich. Die Live-Funktion kann nur über die Mobile App aufgerufen und genutzt werden.

6.3. Wir stellen unsere Dienste kostenlos über die Websites für Mobilgeräte bereit, jedoch gelten weiterhin die Standardgebühren und -tarife Ihres Mobilfunkanbieters. Die Verantwortung für alle Kosten liegt bei Ihnen.

6.4. Um den Service in vollem Umfang nutzen zu können, sollten Sie auf Ihrem Mobilgerät oder Computer (Browser-)Technologien auf dem aktuellen Stand nutzen (z. B. Java-Script, Cookies, Pop-ups aktivieren). Die Nutzung älterer Betriebssysteme oder Internetdienstanbieter führt möglicherweise dazu, dass Sie den Service nur in begrenztem Umfang nutzen können. Bei Nutzung der App können bedingt durch Ihr Mobilgerät, Betriebssystem oder die ausgewählten Einstellungen bestimmte App-Funktionen möglicherweise nur eingeschränkt genutzt werden (z. B. Push-Benachrichtigungen, Filtern von Suchergebnissen nach Entfernung).

6.5. Wenn wir Produktaktualisierungen bereitstellen, insbesondere Updates für unsere Android- und iOS-Apps, empfehlen wir Ihnen dringend, diese möglichst zeitnah zu installieren. Es liegt in Ihrer Verantwortung, derartige Updates innerhalb eines angemessenen Zeitraums zu installieren. Wenn Sie dies nicht tun, obwohl wir Sie darüber informiert haben, dass ein Update verfügbar ist und dass bestimmte Konsequenzen eintreten können, wenn es nicht installiert wird, haften wir nicht für etwaige Produktmängel, die darauf zurückzuführen sind, dass Sie das Update nicht installiert haben; das gilt nicht für Fälle, in denen die Nichtinstallierung bzw. inkorrekte Installierung des Updates dadurch verursacht wurde, dass wir Ihnen unzureichende Anweisungen zur Installierung des Updates bereitgestellt haben.

6.6. Sie sind für die Richtigkeit der Informationen verantwortlich, die Sie bei Ihrer Registrierung bereitstellen. Wenn Sie die in Ihrem Profil oder bei Ihrer Registrierung angegebenen Informationen aktualisieren müssen, können Sie das grundsätzlich jederzeit über Ihr Profil tun. Bestimmte Informationen können jedoch nur aktualisiert werden, indem Sie uns über die Angaben in Abschnitt 16 kontaktieren. Wenn Sie uns kontaktieren müssen, um bestimmte Informationen zu aktualisieren, weisen wir Sie zudem ausdrücklich darauf hin.

6.7. Wir sind lediglich für die technische Bereitstellung des Dienstes verantwortlich (wie in Abschnitt 3 näher beschrieben). Wir werden Ihnen grundsätzlich ermöglichen, Kontakte zu anderen Mitgliedern zu knüpfen. Wir können jedoch nicht garantieren, dass Sie durch die Nutzung des Dienstes einen Partner finden.

6.8. Wir erwarten zwar von unseren Mitgliedern, dass sie den Service auf zuvorkommende und respektvolle Weise (und in Übereinstimmung mit diesen Nutzungsbedingungen) nutzen, wir sind jedoch nicht verantwortlich für jeglichen Missbrauch der über den Service bereitgestellten personenbezogenen Daten; die Nutzung des Service unter Verstoß gegen diese Nutzungsbedingungen; oder jegliche sonstige unbefugte oder rechtswidrige Nutzung. Ebenso sind wir nicht verantwortlich für jeglichen Missbrauch von Daten oder Informationen durch Mitglieder, Nichtmitglieder oder Dritte, denen Sie diese Informationen bereitgestellt haben. Wenn wir jedoch Kenntnis von einem solchen Missbrauch oder einer Rechtswidrigkeit der Inhalte (wie in Abschnitt 9.2 definiert) über unsere Dienste erhalten, ergreifen wir die erforderlichen Vorkehrungen zur Verhinderung künftigen Missbrauchs und sonstiger Verstöße gegen diese Nutzungsbedingungen und die geltenden Gesetze.

6.9. Wir sind sehr bestrebt, einen qualitativ hochwertigen Service bereitzustellen, können jedoch nicht garantieren, dass der Service jederzeit einwandfrei funktioniert, und können nicht gewährleisten, dass der Service immer unterbrechungsfrei, sicher oder fehlerfrei ist. Insbesondere haften wir nicht für Störungen, die die Verfügbarkeit des Service beeinträchtigen, wenn derartige Störungen durch Handlungen oder Ereignisse verursacht werden, die sich unserer Kontrolle entziehen. Außerdem richten wir zwar angemessene technische und organisatorische Sicherheitsvorkehrungen ein, um Ihre personenbezogenen Daten zu schützen, übernehmend jedoch, soweit gesetzlich zulässig, keine Haftung für etwaige unbefugte Zugriffe auf Ihre personenbezogenen Daten (z. B. durch Hacker, die sich unbefugten Zugriff auf unsere Datenbank verschaffen), sofern dies nicht auf ein schuldhaftes Handeln oder Unterlassen unsererseits zurückzuführen ist, insbesondere durch das Versäumnis, alle erforderlichen Vorkehrungen zur Verhinderung von Verstößen gegen die geltenden Gesetze zu treffen.

6.10. Unabhängig von der jeweils geltend gemachten Rechtsgrundlage haften wir im gesetzlich vorgeschriebenen Umfang nur unter folgenden Bedingungen für Schäden, die aus der Nutzung der Dienste entstehen:

a) Wir haften in unbeschränktem Umfang für Schäden, die durch Tod oder Körperverletzung entstehen, sowie für Schäden, die durch vorsätzliches Handeln oder grobe Fahrlässigkeit unsererseits, durch unsere gesetzlichen Vertreter oder Erfüllungsgehilfen oder durch Nichteinhaltung einer von uns übernommenen Garantie oder durch arglistig verschwiegene Mängel entstanden sind.

b) Für alle sonstigen Schäden, die durch Verletzung wesentlicher Vertragspflichten aus einfacher Fahrlässigkeit unsererseits oder seitens unserer gesetzlichen Vertreter oder Erfüllungsgehilfen verursacht werden, beruht unsere Haftung auf den konkreten Sachverhalten. Wesentliche Vertragspflichten (Kardinalpflichten) sind solche, deren Erfüllung die ordnungsgemäße Vertragsdurchführung überhaupt ermöglicht und auf deren Erfüllung sich der Vertragspartner im Normalfall verlassen kann. In solchen Fällen haften wir in Höhe des typischen Schadensersatzes für vorhersehbare Schäden aus einem derartigen Vertrag. In allen anderen Fällen wird die Haftung ausgeschlossen.

c) Die Haftung nach dem deutschen Produkthaftungsgesetz (ProdHaftG) bleibt von den vorstehenden Bestimmungen unberührt.

6.11. Sie sind verpflichtet, geeignete Maßnahmen zu ergreifen, um Schäden zu verhindern und zu begrenzen, insbesondere, soweit technisch möglich, ein angemessenes Sicherheitsniveau für Ihre Daten auf Ihren Geräten zu gewährleisten. Die Haftung für Datenbeschädigung oder -verluste beschränkt sich auf den typischen Wiederherstellungsaufwand, der erforderlich gewesen wäre, wenn Sicherungskopien regelmäßig und entsprechend der Gefährdungsstufe erstellt worden wären und wenn ausreichender Virenschutz eingesetzt worden wäre.

**7\. Verantwortung und Pflichten des Kunden**

7.1. Wenn Sie eine Premium-Mitgliedschaft und/oder andere kostenpflichtige Dienste oder Funktionen erwerben, erklären Sie sich damit einverstanden, alle in den Abonnementbedingungen (und ggf. zusätzlichen Bedingungen, z. B. den jeweiligen Nutzungsbedingungen für den App Store von Apple/Google) aufgeführten Gebühren zu zahlen. Uns steht es darüber hinaus frei, Ihnen den Service erst dann zur Verfügung zu stellen, wenn die Zahlung erfolgt ist, und im gesetzlich zulässigen Rahmen Maßnahmen zu ergreifen, um Ihre ausstehenden Gebühren einzutreiben. Sie sind außerdem verantwortlich (und werden von uns entsprechend belangt) für Rückbuchungsgebühren (z.

7.3. Sie erklären sich damit einverstanden, dass Sie die von uns und/oder durch die Nutzung unserer Dienste bereitgestellten Inhalte, insbesondere Informationen über Dritte (einschließlich anderer Mitglieder) nicht für kommerzielle oder Werbezwecke verwenden.

B. durch ein Computerprogramm oder durch Kopieren und Einfügen der Inhalte). Ebenfalls nehmen Sie zur Kenntnis, dass die Verwendung von Computerprogrammen zum Zweck des automatischen Auslesens von Dateien mit Mitgliedsdaten (z. B. Crawlern) untersagt ist.

7.4. Bei wesentlichen Verstößen Ihrerseits gegen diese Nutzungsbedingungen oder anderweitigen Gesetzwidrigkeiten im Zusammenhang mit Ihrer Nutzung unseres Service haben wir möglicherweise Anspruch auf Schadensersatz nach geltendem Recht.

7.6. Sie erklären sich damit einverstanden, dass Sie alle Nachrichten, die Sie erhalten (sowie alle in Ihrem Profil enthaltenen Informationen, die Sie gerne aufbewahren möchten), in regelmäßigen und angemessenen Abständen abrufen und ggf. diese Informationen auf Ihrem eigenen Computer oder anderen Datenspeichersystemen archivieren. Sie nehmen zur Kenntnis, dass es uns freisteht, alle in Ihrem Konto gespeicherten Nachrichten nach Ablauf eines Zeitraums von zwölf Monaten nach dem Datum zu löschen, an dem die Nachricht empfangen wurde, ohne Sie darüber zu benachrichtigen. Wenn Sie eine Basis-Mitgliedschaft nutzen, nehmen Sie zur Kenntnis, dass alle Daten im Zusammenhang mit Ihrer aktuellen Basis-Mitgliedschaft automatisch gelöscht werden, wenn Ihr Profil 24 Monate lang inaktiv ist.

7.7. Jeder Benutzer ist verpflichtet, die [Content and Conduct Policy](https://terms.hi5.com/content-and-conduct) zu beachten. Darüber hinaus ist es Ihnen nicht gestattet:

– zu versuchen, sich unbefugten Zugriff auf unsere Datenbank oder sonstige Computersysteme zu verschaffen;

– zu versuchen, Softwareprogramme zu ändern, zu übersetzen, anzupassen, zu bearbeiten, zu dekompilieren, in Einzelkomponenten zu zerlegen oder zurückzuentwickeln, die wir im Zusammenhang mit dem Service verwenden;

7.8. Wenn Sie die verhaltensbezogenen Anforderungen gemäß diesem Abschnitt 7 nicht einhalten oder wenn Sie einer wesentlichen Verpflichtung aus den Abonnementsbedingungen nicht nachkommen, steht es uns frei, sofern dies unter den Umständen des Einzelfalls zumutbar ist, eine oder alle der folgenden Maßnahmen zu ergreifen: Wir können Sie auffordern, Ihre nicht mit den Bestimmungen konformen Aktivitäten einzustellen (oder Ihnen auf andere Weise eine Warnung zukommen lassen, dass Ihre Aktivitäten nicht unseren verhaltensbezogenen Anforderungen entsprechen); wir können alle Inhalte löschen, die Sie über den Service unter Verstoß gegen unsere verhaltensbezogenen Anforderungen übermittelt haben; wir können die Bereitstellung des Service für Sie so lange (ganz oder teilweise) aussetzen, bis das Problem gelöst ist (z. B. während wir Ihre Aktivitäten untersuchen); oder (wenn für uns eindeutig feststeht, dass ein schwerwiegender Missbrauch des Service vorliegt) wir können die Bereitstellung des Service für Sie beenden. Wenn Sie Ihre Premium-Mitgliedschaft über Apple/Google erworben haben, erfolgen etwaige Rückerstattungen gemäß den Bedingungen von Apple/Google, wie im Abschnitt 2.4 näher erläutert.

Sie versichern und garantieren, dass Sie Eigentümer Ihrer Inhalte sind oder die notwendigen Lizenzen, Berechtigungen, Einwilligungen und Genehmigungen zu ihrer Veröffentlichung eingeholt haben. Wir haben Mechanismen zur regelmäßigen Überwachung Ihrer Inhalte hinsichtlich der Einhaltung dieser Nutzungsbedingungen und der geltenden gesetzlichen Vorschriften eingerichtet, insbesondere zur Verhinderung eines Missbrauchs Ihrer Daten, haben jedoch keine vollständige Kontrolle über die veröffentlichten Inhalte und haben daher keine Kontrolle über ihre Richtigkeit, Integrität, Qualität oder jedwede andere Aspekte. Wir übernehmen keinerlei Haftung für Inhalte, einschließlich, aber nicht beschränkt auf Fehler oder Auslassungen in den Inhalten oder für Verluste oder Schäden jeglicher Art, die durch die Nutzung von Inhalten entstehen.

9.3. Hiermit gewähren Sie dem Unternehmen das Recht zur Nutzung, Verbreitung, Vervielfältigung, Aufzeichnung, Änderung, Anpassung, Verarbeitung, Kombination, Synchronisation, Erstellung abgeleiteter Werke, Veröffentlichung, öffentlichen Aufführung und öffentlichen Anzeige solcher Inhalte (einschließlich Ihres Benutzernamens und Ihres Abbilds) in den Diensten ausschließlich zum Zweck der Bereitstellung unserer Dienste für Sie gemäß diesen Geschäftsbedingungen.

Sie übernehmen die mit der Nutzung von Inhalten verbundene Haftung, insbesondere in Bezug auf Ihre Gewährleistung der Richtigkeit, Vollständigkeit oder Nützlichkeit dieser Inhalte.

10.1. Diese Nutzungsbedingungen unterliegen den Gesetzen des US-Bundesstaats Kalifornien und werden gemäß diesen ausgelegt, ohne dass etwaige anderslautende kollisionsrechtliche Grundsätze Berücksichtigung finden. Diese Rechtswahl gilt jedoch nicht, wenn sie zur Folge hat, dass Ihnen der Schutz entzogen wird, der Ihnen gemäß Bestimmungen zusteht, von denen von Gesetzes wegen nicht abgewichen werden kann und die ohne die vorstehende Rechtswahl gemäß gesetzlichen Bestimmungen anwendbar gewesen wären.

10.2. Nach geltendem Recht sind wir verpflichtet, Verbraucher über die Existenz der Europäischen Plattform zur Online-Streitbeilegung zu informieren, die von der Europäischen Kommission zur Streitbeilegung eingerichtet wurde.

Une fois que vous aurez créé un compte, nous vous donnerons accès à une plateforme en ligne sur laquelle vous pourrez faire la connaissance d'autres clients inscrits (également appelés des membres). Les Services sont uniquement accessibles depuis des applications mobiles installées sur des appareils iOS et Android (bien qu'à l'avenir, d'autres systèmes d'exploitation pourraient être mis à disposition), ou depuis notre site web Tagged et/ou Hi5 (veuillez noter que certaines fonctionnalités ne sont disponibles que depuis l'application mobile ou le web) ; et les Services comprennent certains services qui sont gratuits et d'autres qui sont payants.

1.2. Les Services comprennent les « profils » des membres, qui contiennent différents contenus(également appelés « données ») mis à disposition par ces membres. Vous pouvez également trouver plus d'informations sur les types de données à caractère personnel collectées et sur la façon dont ces informations sont mises à la disposition des autres membres dans notre [Politique de respect de la vie privée](https://secure.hi5.com/terms_of_service.html?#privacy_policy) (voir la clause 5 ci-dessous). Nous offrons nos Services à l'échelle mondiale ; nos membres ont la possibilité de rechercher et de contacter d'autres membres dans n'importe lequel des pays dans lesquels nous opérons.

**2\. Accès aux Services et conclusion de votre abonnement**

2.1. Pour accéder aux Services et les utiliser, une inscription est nécessaire. Pour ce faire, vous devrez choisir l'une des options d'inscription disponibles, telle que l'e-mail, le SMS, la connexion avec Apple, Google ou Facebook, et fournir des identifiants de connexion, tels qu'une adresse e-mail et un mot de passe de votre choix. Vous êtes responsable de la confidentialité de votre mot de passe et des identifiants de votre compte. Vous êtes également responsable de toutes les activités répréhensibles qui sont menées à l'aide de votre compte. Vous acceptez de nous informer immédiatement de toute utilisation non autorisée de votre compte ou de toute autre violation de sécurité dès que vous en avez connaissance.

2.2. Une fois votre inscription finalisée avec succès, vous pourrez accéder à nos Services gratuits (« Abonnement Basic »).

2.3. Nous proposons également différents services ou fonctionnalités qui sont payants. Avant de vous inscrire en vue d'acheter de tels services ou fonctionnalités, nous vous fournirons de plus amples informations sur ce que vous allez acheter, par exemple, le cas échéant : les caractéristiques principales des services ou des fonctionnalités, la durée de votre abonnement (y compris toute prolongation), comment résilier votre abonnement, son prix et les éventuelles conditions de paiement et limitations au niveau des moyens de paiement. Dans le cas où vous achetez des Biens virtuels (voir la clause 3.3 ci-dessous), nous vous informerons également que ceux-ci sont uniquement échangeables sur les Services contre des marchandises et contenus numériques et qu'ils ne sont pas remboursables. Si vous voulez améliorer votre Abonnement Basic en choisissant un abonnement payant (« Abonnement Premium »), ou accéder à d'autres services ou fonctionnalités payants, vous reconnaissez qu'en appuyant sur le bouton « Acheter maintenant » (ou tout bouton similaire), vous aurez confirmé vouloir acheter l'Abonnement Premium ou les autres services ou fonctionnalités sélectionnés. Notre relation contractuelle pour ces achats sera confirmée à la date à laquelle vous recevrez une confirmation de votre commande. Veuillez cependant noter que l'exécution de votre obligation de paiement envers nous est soumise à la vérification et au traitement de l'achat par le prestataire de services de paiement concerné.

2.4. Vous pouvez également effectuer des achats depuis notre application Apple iOS ou notre application Google Android. Cela comprend l'achat d'un Abonnement Premium ou de tout autre service ou fonctionnalité payants. Dans ce cas, nous restons responsables de la fourniture de nos Services. Vous recevrez une confirmation de commande concernant vos Conditions d'abonnement après avoir effectué un tel achat. Cependant, tout achat et/ou abonnement est conclu (et doit être annulé ou résilié) uniquement par l'intermédiaire d'Apple ou de Google (voir clause 5.3), et est soumis aux normes et principes techniques établis par Apple ou Google, sur lesquels nous n'avons aucun contrôle. En règle générale, l'achat depuis une boutique d'applications se déclenche lorsque vous cliquez sur « Acheter maintenant » (ou tout bouton similaire) et que, le cas échéant, vous saisissez votre mot de passe ou des identifiants équivalents (par exemple, Touch ID ou Face ID) pour l'App Store. Votre relation contractuelle avec Apple ou Google sera confirmée à la date à laquelle Apple ou Google vous enverra un e-mail de confirmation de votre commande. Apple ou Google vous facturera alors les frais correspondant à tout Abonnement Premium par l'intermédiaire de votre compte Apple ou Google. Vous trouverez également dans la boutique d'applications les informations essentielles dont vous avez besoin concernant votre relation contractuelle avec Apple ou Google. Si vous achetez un Abonnement Premium avec renouvellement automatique depuis une boutique d'applications, cet Abonnement Premium sera valable pour une durée déterminée, qui sera automatiquement prolongée à moins que vous ne résiliiez votre abonnement auprès d'Apple ou de Google, conformément aux Conditions générales d'utilisation d'Apple ou de Google.

**3\. Services et achats gratuits et payants**

3.1. L'inscription aux Services et l'utilisation de notre Abonnement Basic sont gratuites.

3.2. Vous pouvez décider de mettre à niveau votre abonnement vers un statut Premium (« Abonnement Premium ») pour un coût mensuel supplémentaire. Si vous choisissez de souscrire un Abonnement Premium, celui sera automatiquement renouvelé chaque mois.

3.3. Vous pouvez acheter des « Biens virtuels » utilisable uniquement sur les Services (comme de « l'or » virtuel). Les achats ou autres acquisitions de Biens virtuels fournissent seulement une licence limitée, non transférable, non sous-licenciable, entièrement révocable pour utiliser ces Biens virtuels afin d'accéder aux services que nous mettons expressément à disposition pour une utilisation avec ces Biens virtuels pour votre usage personnel non commercial (tels que les animations en direct, ce qu'on appelle des « Cadeaux » virtuels). Les Biens virtuels sont échangeables uniquement sur les Services contre des marchandises et contenus numériques. Les Biens virtuels n'expirent pas. Les Biens virtuels ne sont pas remboursables. Les Biens virtuels n'ont aucune valeur monétaire et ne constituent pas une monnaie ou un bien de quelque nature que ce soit. Les Biens virtuels ne sont pas transférables ni cessibles. Vous n'aurez pas droit à un remboursement, à de l'argent ou à toute autre compensation pour les Biens virtuels non utilisés lorsqu'un compte est fermé en raison d'une violation grave de votre part des présentes Conditions générales d'utilisation, ou lorsque vous décidez de fermer votre compte.

3.4. Vous pouvez utiliser des Biens virtuels pour acheter des Cadeaux à d'autres utilisateurs de notre application ou d'autres applications qui vous sont visibles. Le prix de chaque Cadeau sera affiché au moment de l'achat. Les Cadeaux constituent une licence limitée permettant d'accéder à une certaine fonctionnalité des Services.

3.6. Nous pouvons être amenés à apporter des modifications aux Services : (i) pour refléter des changements intervenus dans les lois pertinentes et les exigences réglementaires ; ou (ii) pour mettre en œuvre des ajustements et des améliorations techniques mineurs, par exemple pour répondre à une menace de sécurité (cependant, ces modifications n'affecteront pas votre utilisation des Services). En outre, bien que nous fournissions une description de nos Services sur notre site web, nous pouvons modifier les caractéristiques principales de nos Services de temps à autre sans que cela n'entraîne de coûts supplémentaires pour vous. Cependant, si nous le faisons, nous vous en informerons dans un délai raisonnable avant que cette modification ne prenne effet et vous pourrez alors nous contacter pour résilier votre abonnement dans les 30 jours suivant la date à laquelle vous aurez été informé de ladite modification si celle-ci altère votre capacité à accéder aux Services ou votre expérience d'utilisation de ceux-ci, et si cette altération n'est pas seulement insignifiante avant l'entrée en vigueur des modifications (et, dans le cas où vous avez souscrit un Abonnement Premium par notre intermédiaire, vous recevrez un remboursement de notre part pour la partie des Services que vous avez payée mais dont vous n'avez pu bénéficier en raison de la résiliation anticipée de votre abonnement). Toute notification de ce type vous informera de la nature et des motifs de la modification effectuée, de la date à laquelle elle prendra effet, et de votre droit de résilier l'abonnement dans les 30 jours suivant la notification, conformément à la présente clause 3.6.

**4\. Utilisation de vos données**

À cette fin, nous avons élaboré de nombreuses normes techniques et organisationnelles. Il est de votre responsabilité de suivre les directives d'utilisation fournies à la clause 8 ci-dessous. Si des anomalies surviennent, vous pouvez être contacté par notre « équipe Confiance et sécurité » dans le but de les corriger. Dans ce cas, nous indiquerons, en détail, les raisons pour lesquelles nous vous contactons, et vous avez l'obligation de coopérer et de répondre dans un délai raisonnable à partir du moment où cette demande vous a été soumise. Si nous vous recommandons certaines actions, nous vous conseillons vivement de les prendre en considération. Si vous refusez d'effectuer une action qui vous a été recommandée, vous êtes tenu de nous en informer dans un délai raisonnable et d'indiquer les raisons pour lesquelles vous refusez la manière de procéder que nous avons suggérée. Vous devez également nous signaler les contenus ou comportements problématiques par le biais de la fonction de signalement.

Si vous ne le faites pas, vous pouvez toujours résilier avant la fin de la période d'abonnement en cours, mais nous pourrons percevoir l'argent pour la période suivante, que nous vous rembourserons par la suite. Votre droit de résilier votre Abonnement Premium pour d'autres raisons reste inchangé. Dans ce cas, vous devez indiquer le motif de la résiliation extraordinaire lorsque vous résiliez votre abonnement sur la base de ce motif. Si votre compte d'Abonnement Premium est facturé via Apple, vous devez procéder à l'annulation au moins 24 heures avant le prochain paiement automatique prévu, en suivant la procédure décrite [ici](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039).

Sous réserve des clauses 5.5 et 11 ci-dessous, toute résiliation de votre abonnement ne prendra effet qu'à la fin de la période de facturation en cours (et, à ce titre, vous n'aurez droit à aucun remboursement). Aussi, pour vous assurer que votre Abonnement Premium n'est pas prolongé automatiquement, vous devez nous dire que vous voulez résilier votre abonnement avant la fin de la période d'abonnement en cours.

5.4. Si vous supprimez votre Abonnement Basic ou Premium, tous les Biens virtuels achetés précédemment seront également supprimés, et les obligations de paiement existantes suite à l'achat de services ou de fonctionnalités payants (comme les Biens virtuels) resteront actives, sous réserve des droits d'annulation applicables (voir la clause 12).

5.5. Pour authentifier votre identité et votre demande de résiliation, vous devez indiquer l'adresse e-mail associée à votre compte ou d'autres informations personnelles nous permettant de vous identifier.

**6\. Fonctionnalité, compatibilité, interopérabilité, garanties et responsabilité**

6.1. Veuillez noter que, bien que nous fassions de notre mieux, nous ne pouvons pas garantir que les Services seront disponibles 100 % du temps. La disponibilité de nos Services peut être réduite en raison d'événements de maintenance et de mises à jour du logiciel, ainsi que de toute période pendant laquelle les Service sont indisponibles en raison de problèmes techniques ou de toute autre nature qui sont indépendants de notre volonté.

6.2. Certaines fonctions ne sont disponibles que depuis le site web ou l'application. Il n'est pas possible depuis l'application mobile, notamment, d'accéder ou d'utiliser certaines fonctions, telles que Tags, Luv et la personnalisation du profil web). La fonction Live n'est accessible et utilisable que par le biais de l'application mobile.

6.3. Bien que nous fournissions nos Services par l'intermédiaire des sites web mobiles gratuitement, les frais et tarifs standard de votre opérateur de téléphonie mobile continueront à s'appliquer. Vous acceptez d'assumer la responsabilité de tous les frais encourus.

6.4. Pour pouvoir utiliser pleinement les Services, vous devez utiliser des technologies (de navigateur) à jour sur votre appareil mobile ou votre ordinateur (par ex. activer Java script, les cookies et les pop-ups). Si vous utilisez un système d'exploitation ou un fournisseur d'accès à Internet plus ancien, il se peut que vous bénéficiiez d'une utilisation limitée des Services. Lorsque vous utilisez l'application, votre appareil mobile, votre système d'exploitation, ou les paramètres sélectionnés peuvent restreindre certaines fonctions de l'application (par ex. les messages push ou la recherche de proximité).

6.5. Si nous proposons des mises à jour de produits, y compris des mises à jour pour nos applications Android et iOS, nous vous recommandons vivement de les installer dès que possible. Il est de votre responsabilité d'installer ces mises à jour dans un délai raisonnable. Si vous ne le faites pas, bien que nous vous ayons informé qu'une mise à jour est disponible et des conséquences de sa non-installation, nous ne serons pas responsables des défauts du produit résultant de votre manquement à installer la mise à jour concernée ; ceci ne s'appliquera pas si le fait que vous n'ayez pas installé la mise à jour ou que vous l'ayez mal installée est dû à des instructions d'installation inadéquates que nous vous aurions fournies.

6.6. Vous êtes responsable de l'exactitude des informations fournies à lors de votre inscription. Si vous avez besoin de mettre à jour votre profil ou vos informations d'inscription, vous pouvez le faire à tout moment depuis votre profil. Cependant, certaines informations peuvent être mises à jour seulement en nous contactant à l'aide des coordonnées indiquées à la clause 16. Il vous sera également précisé si vous devez nous contacter pour mettre à jour certaines informations.

6.7. Nous sommes uniquement responsables de la fourniture technique des Services (comme décrit plus en détail à la clause 3). Nous vous autorisons à contacter d'autres membres. Nous ne pouvons cependant pas garantir que vous trouverez un partenaire suite à votre utilisation de nos Services.

6.8. Bien que nous attendions de nos membres qu'ils utilisent nos Services de manière paisible et respectueuse (et conformément aux présentes Conditions générales d'utilisation), nous ne sommes pas responsables de l'utilisation abusive des données à caractère personnel mises à disposition par le biais des Services, de toute autre utilisation des Services par ses membres qui est contraire aux présentes Conditions générales d'utilisation, ou encore de toute utilisation autrement non autorisée ou illégale. Nous ne sommes pas non plus responsables de l'utilisation abusive des données ou des informations par les membres, les non-membres ou tout autre tiers lorsque vous avez fourni ces informations au tiers concerné. Cependant, une fois que nous avons connaissance d'une telle utilisation abusive ou illégale des Contenus (tels que définis à la clause 9.2) par le biais de nos Services, nous prendrons les mesures de précaution nécessaires pour empêcher toute utilisation abusive et autres violations futures des présentes Conditions générales d'utilisation et des lois applicables.

6.9. Bien que nous nous efforcions de fournir un service de haute qualité, nous ne garantissons pas que les Services seront en parfait état de fonctionnement à tout moment et ne pouvons pas garantir qu'ils seront toujours assurés de manière ininterrompue, sécurisée ou sans erreur. En particulier, nous ne sommes pas responsables des perturbations qui affectent l'accessibilité de nos Services lorsque ces perturbations sont causées par des actions ou des événements qui échappent à notre contrôle. En outre, bien que nous mettions en place des mesures de sécurité techniques et organisationnelles appropriées pour protéger vos données à caractère personnel, dans toute la mesure permise par la loi, nous ne serons pas responsables de tout accès non autorisé par des tiers à vos données à caractère personnel (par ex. en raison de hackers obtenant un accès non autorisé à notre base de données), si cela n'est pas dû à une action ou omission répréhensible de notre part, en particulier une incapacité à prendre toutes les mesures de précaution nécessaires pour prévenir toute violation des lois applicables.

6.10. Nous sommes responsables des dommages résultant de l'utilisation des Services dans le cadre des dispositions légales, quel que soit la base juridique, seulement conformément aux dispositions suivantes :

a) Nous sommes responsables, sans limitation, des dommages résultant d'un décès ou de lésions corporelles, ainsi que des dommages causés par notre intention délibérée ou notre négligence grave, par nos représentants légaux ou nos agents d'exécution, ainsi que des dommages causés par le non-respect d'une garantie que nous avons donnée ou par des défauts dissimulés de manière frauduleuse.

b) Pour tous les autres dommages dus à un manquement à nos obligations contractuelles essentielles résultant d'une simple négligence de notre part, de nos représentants légaux ou de nos agents d'exécution, notre responsabilité sera fondée sur le fond de l'affaire. Les obligations contractuelles essentielles (obligations cardinales) sont celles dont l'exécution permet en premier lieu la bonne exécution du contrat et sur l'exécution desquelles le partenaire contractuel peut normalement compter. Dans de tels cas, nous sommes redevables d'un montant de compensation classique pour des dommages prévisibles dans un tel contrat. Toute autre responsabilité est exclue.

Po zarejestrowaniu konta zapewnimy użytkownikowi dostęp do platformy internetowej, za pośrednictwem której użytkownik będzie mógł poznać innych zarejestrowanych klientów (zwanych również członkami). Dostęp do Usługi można uzyskać wyłącznie za pośrednictwem aplikacji mobilnych na urządzeniach z systemem iOS i Android (chociaż w przyszłości dostęp może być możliwy za pośrednictwem innych systemów operacyjnych) lub za pośrednictwem naszej witryny internetowej Tagged i/lub Hi5 (należy pamiętać, że niektóre funkcje są dostępne tylko za pośrednictwem aplikacji mobilnej lub witryny internetowej), a Usługa obejmuje zarówno usługi, które są bezpłatne, oraz takie, które są płatne.

1.2. Usługa zawiera „profile” członków, które zawierają treści (zwane również „danymi”) udostępniane przez tych członków. Użytkownik może również znaleźć więcej informacji na temat rodzajów danych osobowych, które są gromadzone, oraz sposobu, w jaki sposób te informacje są udostępniane innym członkom, w naszej [Polityce prywatności](https://secure.hi5.com/terms_of_service.html?#privacy_policy) (patrz punkt 5 poniżej). Oferujemy naszą Usługę na całym świecie; a nasi członkowie mogą wyszukiwać innych członków i kontaktować się z nimi w dowolnym z krajów, w których działamy.

**2\. Dostęp do usługi i zakończenie subskrypcji**

2.1. Aby uzyskać dostęp do Usługi i korzystać z niej, użytkownik musi się zarejestrować. Aby to zrobić, użytkownik musi wybrać jedną z dostępnych opcji rejestracji, taką jak wiadomość e-mail, SMS, opcja logowania za pomocą aplikacji Apple, przez Google lub Facebook, a następnie podać dane logowania, takie jak adres e-mail i wybrane przez siebie hasło. Za zachowanie poufności swojego hasła i danych logowania do konta odpowiada użytkownik. Ponadto użytkownik ponosi odpowiedzialność za wszelkie zawinione działania, które będą miały miejsce z wykorzystaniem konta użytkownika. Użytkownik zgadza się natychmiast powiadomić nas o każdym nieautoryzowanym użyciu jego konta lub jakimkolwiek innym naruszeniu bezpieczeństwa, gdy tylko się o nim dowie.

2.2. Po pomyślnej rejestracji użytkownik uzyska dostęp do naszej bezpłatnej usługi („Członkostwo podstawowe”).

2.3. Oferujemy również różne usługi lub funkcje, które podlegają opłacie. Zanim użytkownik zarejestruje się w celu zakupu takich usług lub funkcji, przekażemy mu dalsze informacje na temat przedmiotu zakupu – na przykład, w stosownych przypadkach: główne cechy usług lub funkcji, okres subskrypcji (w tym wszelkie przedłużenia), sposób zakończenia subskrypcji, cena i wszelkie płatności warunki i ograniczenia dotyczące środków płatności. W przypadku zakupu Towarów wirtualnych (patrz punkt 3.3 poniżej) poinformujemy użytkownika, że można je wymienić wyłącznie w Usłudze na cyfrowe towary i treści oraz że nie podlegają one zwrotowi. Jeśli użytkownik chce rozszerzyć swoje Członkostwo podstawowe, wybierając członkostwo podlegające opłacie („Członkostwo Premium”), bądź chce uzyskać dostęp do innych usług lub funkcji podlegających opłacie, tym samym potwierdza poprzez naciśnięcie przycisku „Kup teraz” (lub podobnego przycisku), że wyraża wolę zakupu Członkostwa Premium albo innej wybranej usługi lub funkcji. Nasz stosunek umowny dotyczący takich zakupów zostanie potwierdzony w dniu, w którym użytkownik otrzyma potwierdzenie złożenia zamówienia. Należy jednak pamiętać, że wypełnienie zobowiązania płatniczego użytkownika wobec nas zależy od weryfikacji i przetworzenia zakupu przez odpowiedniego dostawcę usług płatniczych.

2.4. Użytkownik może również dokonywać zakupów za pośrednictwem naszej aplikacji Apple iOS lub aplikacji Google Android. Obejmuje to zakup Członkostwa Premium albo innych usług lub funkcji podlegających opłacie. W takim przypadku pozostajemy odpowiedzialni za świadczenie naszej Usługi. Po dokonaniu takiego zakupu użytkownik otrzyma potwierdzenie złożenia zamówienia wraz z Warunkami subskrypcji. Każdy zakup i/lub subskrypcja są jednak zawierane (i muszą być anulowane lub zakończone) wyłącznie za pośrednictwem firmy Apple/Google (patrz punkt 5.3) i podlegają standardom technicznym i zasadom ustanowionym przez firmy Apple/Google, nad którymi nie mamy kontroli. Zasadniczo zakup za pośrednictwem sklepu z aplikacjami następuje po kliknięciu przycisku „Kup teraz” (lub porównywalnego przycisku) i, w razie potrzeby, wprowadzeniu hasła lub równoważnych danych uwierzytelniających (np. Touch ID lub Face ID) do sklepu z aplikacjami. Stosunek umowny użytkownika z firmą Apple/Google zostanie potwierdzony w dniu, w którym firma Apple/Google wyśle użytkownikowi wiadomość e-mail z potwierdzeniem złożonego zamówienia, oraz gdy firma Apple/Google wystawi użytkownikowi fakturę za wszelkie opłaty związane z Członkostwem Premium za pośrednictwem konta Apple/Google należącego do użytkownika. W sklepie z aplikacjami użytkownik znajdzie również wszystkie niezbędne informacje na temat relacji umownych z firmą Apple/Google. Jeśli użytkownik zakupi Członkostwo Premium za pośrednictwem sklepu z aplikacjami, które podlega automatycznemu przedłużeniu, Członkostwo Premium będzie obowiązywać przez określony czas, który zostanie automatycznie przedłużony, chyba że użytkownik zakończy subskrypcję za pośrednictwem firmy Apple/Google zgodnie z Warunkami korzystania z usługi firmy Apple/Google. Należy pamiętać, że punkty 5.3 i 12 niniejszych Warunków korzystania z usługi nie będą miały zastosowania w przypadku zakupu Członkostwa Premium za pośrednictwem firmy Apple/Google.

2.5. Prosimy o zapoznanie się z punktami 14 i 15 poniżej, gdzie przedstawiamy warunki, które będą miały zastosowanie, jeśli użytkownik pobrał naszą aplikację z Apple lub Google. Prosimy również o zwrócenie uwagi, że jeśli nasza aplikacja została pobrana ze sklepu Apple/Google, obowiązują warunki korzystania z usługi sklepu Apple/Google, które będą miały pierwszeństwo przed niniejszymi Warunkami korzystania z usługi, jeśli wystąpi jakikolwiek konflikt.

**3\. Bezpłatne i odpłatne usługi i zakupy**

3.1. Rejestracja w Usłudze i korzystanie z Członkostwa podstawowego jest bezpłatne.

3.2. Użytkownik może zdecydować o uaktualnieniu członkostwa do statusu Premium („Członkostwo Premium”) za dodatkową opłatą miesięczną. Jeśli użytkownik zdecyduje się na zakup Członkostwa Premium, będzie ono automatycznie odnawiane co miesiąc.

3.3. Użytkownik może kupować „Towary wirtualne” do użytku wyłącznie w Usłudze (takie jak wirtualne „złoto”). Zakupy lub inne nabycia Towarów wirtualnych zapewniają jedynie ograniczoną, niezbywalną, niepodlegającą sublicencjonowaniu, w pełni odwołalną licencję na korzystanie z takich Towarów wirtualnych w celu uzyskania dostępu do usług, które wyraźnie udostępniamy z takimi Towarami wirtualnymi do osobistego, niekomercyjnego użytku (takiego jak animacje na żywo, tak zwane wirtualne „Prezenty”). Towary wirtualne można wymieniać wyłącznie w Usłudze na cyfrowe towary i treści. Towary wirtualne nie tracą ważności. Towary wirtualne nie podlegają zwrotowi. Towary wirtualne nie mają wartości pieniężnej i nie stanowią waluty ani własności jakiegokolwiek rodzaju. Towary wirtualne nie podlegają przeniesieniu ani cesji. Użytkownik nie będzie uprawniony do zwrotu pieniędzy ani żadnej innej rekompensaty za niewykorzystane Towary wirtualne, gdy konto użytkownika zostanie zamknięte z powodu poważnego naruszenia przez niego niniejszych Warunków korzystania z usługi lub gdy użytkownik zdecyduje się zamknąć swoje konto.

3.4. Użytkownik może używać Towarów wirtualnych do kupowania Prezentów dla innych użytkowników naszej aplikacji lub innych aplikacji, które są dla niego widoczne. Cena każdego Prezentu zostanie wyświetlona w punkcie zakupu. Prezenty stanowią ograniczoną licencję na dostęp do określonej funkcji w Usłudze.

3.5. Możemy również od czasu do czasu oferować pewne dodatkowe usługi, takie jak oferty zakupowe i handlu elektronicznego oraz różne usługi informacyjne.

3.6. Możemy zmienić Usługę: (i) w celu odzwierciedlenia zmian w odpowiednich przepisach i wymogach regulacyjnych lub (ii) w celu wdrożenia drobnych technicznych dostosowań i ulepszeń, na przykład w celu wyeliminowania zagrożenia bezpieczeństwa (jednak zmiany te nie będą miały wpływu na korzystanie z Usługi). Ponadto, mimo że udostępniamy opis naszej Usługi w naszej witrynie internetowej, możemy od czasu do czasu zmieniać główne cechy naszej Usługi bez ponoszenia przez użytkownika żadnych dodatkowych kosztów. W przypadku gdy to zrobimy, powiadomimy użytkownika o tym w rozsądnym terminie przed wejściem w życie takiej zmiany, a użytkownik może skontaktować się z nami, aby zakończyć subskrypcję w ciągu 30 dni od otrzymania informacji o takiej zmianie, jeśli zmiana ogranicza zdolność dostępu do Usług przez użytkownika lub ogranicza użyteczność Usług i jeśli takie ograniczenie jest nie tylko nieistotne przed wejściem zmian w życie (oraz, w przypadku subskrypcji w odniesieniu do Członkostwa Premium nabytego za naszym pośrednictwem, użytkownik otrzyma od nas zwrot pieniędzy część usługi, za którą zapłacił, ale której nie otrzymał z powodu wcześniejszego zakończenia subskrypcji). Każde takie zawiadomienie poinformuje użytkownika o charakterze i powodach wprowadzenia takiej zmiany, czasie, w którym zmiana wejdzie w życie, oraz prawie użytkownika do zakończenia subskrypcji w ciągu 30 dni od takiego powiadomienia zgodnie z niniejszym punktem 3.6.

**4\. Wykorzystanie danych**

4.1. Więcej informacji na temat tego, jak wykorzystujemy lub w inny sposób przetwarzamy dane osobowe użytkownika oraz jakie są nasze obowiązki w zakresie ochrony danych, można znaleźć w naszej [Polityce prywatności](https://secure.hi5.com/terms_of_service.html?#privacy_policy).

4.2. Nieustannie staramy się chronić użytkowników przed nękaniem, takim jak ataki hakerów, spam lub oszustwa romansowe. W tym celu opracowaliśmy liczne standardy techniczne i organizacyjne. Obowiązkiem użytkownika jest przestrzeganie wskazówek zawartych w punkcie 8 poniżej. W przypadku pojawienia się nieprawidłowości nasz zespół ds. zaufania i bezpieczeństwa może kontaktować się z użytkownikiem w celu usunięcia takich nieprawidłowości. W takim przypadku szczegółowo określimy powody skontaktowania się z użytkownikiem, a użytkownik jest zobowiązany do współpracy i udzielenia odpowiedzi w rozsądnym terminie od otrzymania takiego wniosku. Jeśli zalecimy jakieś działania, użytkownik powinien poważnie rozważyć ich podjęcie. Jeśli użytkownik odrzuci zalecane działania, jest zobowiązany do poinformowania nas o tym w rozsądnym terminie wraz z podaniem powodów, dla których odmawia podjęcie sugerowanych przez nas działań. Użytkownik jest też zobowiązany do zgłaszania nam problematycznych treści lub zachowań za pośrednictwem funkcji dokonywania zgłoszeń.

4.3. Możemy automatycznie usuwać wiadomości bez odpowiedzi wysłane przez profile lub do profili, które zostały zidentyfikowane jako spam lub oszustwo romansowe bądź zostały usunięte z innych przyczyn.

**5\. Zakończenie/przedłużenie**

**W przypadku gdy użytkownik chce anulować Członkostwo Premium w ciągu 14-dniowego okresu anulowania / możliwości odstąpienia od umowy, prosimy o zapoznanie się z punktem 11 (prawo użytkownika do anulowania).**

5.1. Użytkownik może zakończyć Członkostwo podstawowe w dowolnym momencie ze skutkiem natychmiastowym w ustawieniach konta lub poprzez skontaktowanie się z nami pod adresem [(support@themeetgroup.com)](mailto:support@themeetgroup.com).

5.2. Jeśli Członkostwo podstawowe użytkownika obejmuje aktywne Towary wirtualne, użytkownik musi poinformować nas o zakończeniu na adres [support@themeetgroup.com](mailto:support@themeetgroup.com). Należy pamiętać o podaniu adresu e-mail powiązanego z kontem użytkownika lub porównywalnych danych logowania, które umożliwią nam identyfikację użytkownika.

5.3. Jeśli w dowolnym czasie użytkownik postanowi zrezygnować z Członkostwa Premium, może to zrobić w dogodnym dla siebie momencie. Jeśli konto Członkostwa Premium użytkownika jest opłacane za pośrednictwem naszej witryny internetowej, użytkownik musi ją odwiedzić pod adresem [http://www.hi5.com/account\_info.html](http://www.hi5.com/account_info.html), kliknąć kartę Subskrypcje i płatności, wybrać pozycję „Anuluj subskrypcję” i kliknąć „Anuluj Premium” na co najmniej trzy dni przed kolejną zaplanowaną automatyczną płatnością, abyśmy mogli poprawnie przetworzyć rezygnację użytkownika. Jeśli nie uda się tego zrobić w tym terminie, użytkownik nadal może anulować subskrypcję przed końcem danego okresu subskrypcji, jednak pieniądze za kolejny okres mogą zostać pobrane, ale dokonamy ich zwrotu. Prawo do zakończenia Członkostwa Premium na innej podstawie pozostaje niezmienione. W takim przypadku użytkownik musi podać powody rozwiązania umowy w trybie nadzwyczajnym, gdy subskrypcja ma zostać anulowana na tej podstawie. Jeśli konto Członkostwa Premium użytkownika jest rozliczane za pośrednictwem Apple, użytkownik musi je anulować na co najmniej 24 godziny przed następną zaplanowaną automatyczną płatnością, postępując zgodnie z procesem opisanym [tutaj](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039). Jeśli konto Członkostwa Premium użytkownika jest rozliczane za pośrednictwem Google Play, użytkownik musi je anulować w ciągu siedmiu dni od rozpoczęcia cyklu rozliczeniowego, postępując zgodnie z procesem opisanym [**tutaj**](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481). Użytkownik może również napisać do nas, korzystając z danych kontaktowych podanych poniżej w punkcie 16. Z zastrzeżeniem punktu 5.5 i punktu 11 poniżej żadne wypowiedzenie subskrypcji nie wejdzie w życie przed końcem bieżącego okresu rozliczeniowego (i w związku z tym użytkownik nie będzie uprawniony do zwrotu pieniędzy). W związku z tym, aby mieć pewność, że Członkostwo Premium użytkownika nie zostanie automatycznie przedłużone, użytkownik musi poinformować nas, że chce zakończyć subskrypcję przed końcem bieżącego okresu subskrypcji.

5.4. Jeśli użytkownik usunie swoje Członkostwo podstawowe lub Premium, wszelkie wcześniej zakupione Towary wirtualne również zostaną usunięte, a istniejące zobowiązania płatnicze z tytułu zakupu płatnych usług lub funkcji (takich jak Towary wirtualne) pozostaną w mocy, z zastrzeżeniem obowiązujących praw do anulowania (patrz punkt 12).

5.5. Aby zweryfikować swoją tożsamość i żądanie rozwiązania umowy, użytkownik musi podać adres e-mail powiązany z jego kontem lub inne dane osobowe, które umożliwią nam identyfikację użytkownika.

5.6. Jeśli użytkownik zdecyduje się na zakup Członkostwa Premium, będzie ono automatycznie odnawiane co miesiąc, o ile użytkownik nie anuluje subskrypcji zgodnie z warunkami w niniejszym punkcie.

5.7. Jeśli użytkownik zrezygnuje z Członkostwa Premium, status jego konta zostanie przywrócony do Członkostwa podstawowego. Aby zakończyć Członkostwo podstawowe, należy postępować zgodnie z procedurą określoną w punkcie 5.1.

5.8. Z zastrzeżeniem punktu 5.4 i zgodnie z punktem 3.6, jeśli użytkownik chce zakończyć swoje Członkostwo Premium, ponieważ poinformowaliśmy go o nadchodzącej istotnej zmianie w naszej Usłudze, subskrypcja zakończy się natychmiast po otrzymaniu przez nas wypowiedzenia w formie pisemnej (na przykład wysłanego w wiadomości e-mail lub faksem), a my zwrócimy użytkownikowi pieniądze za każdą część Członkostwa Premium, której nie zrealizowaliśmy. Jeśli użytkownik zakupił Członkostwo Premium za pośrednictwem firmy Apple/Google, wszelkie anulowanie i zwrot pieniędzy zostaną dokonane zgodnie z warunkami firmy Apple/Google, jak opisano w punktach 2.4 i 5.3.

**6\. Funkcjonalność, kompatybilność, interoperacyjność, gwarancje i odpowiedzialność**

6.1. Należy pamiętać, że choć dokładamy wszelkich starań, nie możemy zagwarantować, że Usługa będzie dostępna przez 100% czasu. Dostępność naszej Usługi może być ograniczona z powodu konserwacji i aktualizacji oprogramowania, a także w trakcie wszelkich okresów, w których Usługa jest niedostępna z powodu problemów technicznych lub innych będących poza naszą kontrolą.

6.2. Niektóre funkcje są dostępne tylko za pośrednictwem witryny internetowej lub aplikacji. Za pośrednictwem aplikacji mobilnej nie jest możliwe między innymi uzyskanie dostępu do niektórych funkcji, takich jak Tagged, Luv i dostosowywanie profilu internetowego, ani korzystanie z nich. Funkcja Live jest dostępna i używana wyłącznie za pośrednictwem aplikacji mobilnej.

6.3. Chociaż nasze Usługi za pośrednictwem witryn mobilnych świadczymy bezpłatnie, nadal będą obowiązywać standardowe opłaty i stawki operatora komórkowego użytkownika. Użytkownik ponosi odpowiedzialność za wszystkie opłaty.

6.4. Aby pełni korzystać z Usługi, użytkownik powinien korzystać z aktualnych technologii (przeglądarek) na swoim urządzeniu mobilnym lub komputerze (np. poprzez włączenie skryptu Java, plików cookie, wyskakujących okienek). Jeśli użytkownik korzysta ze starszego systemu operacyjnego lub dostawcy usług internetowych, możliwości korzystania z Usługi mogą być ograniczone. Podczas korzystania z aplikacji urządzenie mobilne użytkownika, jego system operacyjny lub wybrane ustawienia mogą ograniczać niektóre funkcje aplikacji (np. wiadomości push, wyszukiwanie odległości).

6.5. Jeśli oferujemy aktualizacje produktów, w tym aktualizacje naszych aplikacji na systemy Android i iOS, zdecydowanie zalecamy zainstalowanie ich najszybciej, jak to możliwe. Zainstalowanie takich aktualizacji w rozsądnym czasie jest obowiązkiem użytkownika. Jeśli użytkownik tego nie zrobi, pomimo że poinformowaliśmy go o dostępności aktualizacji i konsekwencjach jej niezainstalowania, nie będziemy ponosić odpowiedzialności za jakiekolwiek wady produktu wynikające z niezainstalowania aktualizacji; nie ma to zastosowania, jeśli fakt, że użytkownik nie zainstalował aktualizacji lub zainstalował ją w niewłaściwy sposób, jest spowodowany nieodpowiednimi instrukcjami instalacji dostarczonymi przez nas.

6.6. Użytkownik ponosi odpowiedzialność za dokładność informacji podanych podczas rejestracji. Jeśli użytkownik chce zaktualizować swój profil lub informacje podane przy rejestracji, może to zrobić w swoim profilu w dowolnym momencie. Istnieją jednak pewne informacje, które można zaktualizować wyłącznie poprzez skontaktowanie się nami za pomocą danych kontaktowych podanych w punkcie 16. Użytkownik zostanie również poinformowany o konieczności skontaktowania się z nami w celu zaktualizowania określonych informacji.

6.7. Jesteśmy odpowiedzialni wyłącznie za techniczne świadczenie Usługi (jak opisano szerzej w punkcie 3). Zasadniczo umożliwimy użytkownikowi nawiązywanie kontaktów z innymi członkami. Nie możemy jednak zagwarantować, że użytkownik znajdzie partnera w wyniku korzystania z Usługi.

6.8. Chociaż oczekujemy, że nasi członkowie będą korzystać z Usługi w sposób uprzejmy i pełen szacunku (oraz zgodnie z niniejszymi Warunkami korzystania z usługi), nie ponosimy odpowiedzialności za jakiekolwiek niewłaściwe wykorzystanie danych osobowych udostępnionych za pośrednictwem Usługi; jakiekolwiek inne korzystanie z Usługi przez jej członków, które jest sprzeczne z niniejszymi Warunkami korzystania z usługi; lub jakiekolwiek korzystanie, które jest w inny sposób nieautoryzowane lub niezgodne z prawem. Nie ponosimy również odpowiedzialności za jakiekolwiek niewłaściwe wykorzystanie danych lub informacji przez członków, osoby niebędące członkami lub jakiekolwiek strony trzecie, w przypadku gdy użytkownik przekazał stronie trzeciej takie informacje. Po otrzymaniu przez informacji o takim niewłaściwym użyciu lub niezgodności z prawem Treści (zgodnie z definicją w punkcie 9.2) dostępnych za pośrednictwem naszych Usług podejmiemy jednak niezbędne środki ostrożności, aby zapobiec wszelkim przyszłym nadużyciom i innym naruszeniom niniejszych Warunków korzystania z usługi i obowiązujących przepisów prawa.

6.9. Chociaż ciężko pracujemy, aby zapewnić wysokiej jakości usługi, nie gwarantujemy, że Usługa będzie działać idealnie przez cały czas, i nie możemy zagwarantować, że Usługa będzie zawsze nieprzerwana, bezpieczna lub wolna od błędów. W szczególności nie ponosimy odpowiedzialności za zakłócenia, które wpływają na dostępność Usługi, jeśli takie zakłócenia są spowodowane działaniami lub zdarzeniami będącymi poza naszą kontrolą. Ponadto, chociaż wprowadzamy odpowiednie techniczne i organizacyjne środki bezpieczeństwa w celu ochrony danych osobowych użytkownika, w najszerszym zakresie dozwolonym przez prawo nie będziemy ponosić odpowiedzialności za nieautoryzowany dostęp stron trzecich do danych osobowych użytkownika (np. gdy hakerzy uzyskają nieuprawniony dostęp do naszej bazy danych), jeśli nie jest to spowodowane zawinionym działaniem lub zaniechaniem z naszej strony, w szczególności niepodjęciem wszelkich niezbędnych środków ostrożności w celu zapobieżenia naruszeniom obowiązujących przepisów prawa.

6.10. Ponosimy odpowiedzialność za szkody wynikające z korzystania z Usług w zakresie przepisów ustawowych, niezależnie od podstawy prawnej, wyłącznie zgodnie z poniższymi postanowieniami:

a) Ponosimy nieograniczoną odpowiedzialność za szkody wynikające ze śmierci lub obrażeń ciała, jak również za szkody spowodowane umyślnym działaniem lub rażącym niedbalstwem z naszej strony, ze strony naszych przedstawicieli prawnych lub zastępców, jak również za szkody spowodowane niezgodnością z udzieloną przez nas gwarancją lub nieuczciwie ukrytymi wadami.

b) W przypadku wszystkich innych szkód wynikających z naruszenia istotnych zobowiązań umownych wynikających ze zwykłego zaniedbania przez nas, naszych przedstawicieli prawnych lub zastępców nasza odpowiedzialność będzie oparta na meritum sprawy. Istotne zobowiązania umowne (zobowiązania kardynalne) to takie, których wypełnienie umożliwia przede wszystkim poprawną realizację umowy i na których wypełnieniu partner umowy może zwykle polegać. W takich przypadkach ponosimy odpowiedzialność za odszkodowanie w wysokości typowej dla przewidywalnych szkód w takiej umowie. Wszelka inna odpowiedzialność jest wyłączona.

c) Powyższe postanowienia nie mają wpływu na odpowiedzialność wynikającą z niemieckiej ustawy o odpowiedzialności za produkt.

6.11. Użytkownik jest zobowiązany do podjęcia odpowiednich środków w celu zapobiegania szkód i łagodzenia ich, w szczególności w celu zapewnienia, o ile jest to technicznie możliwe, odpowiedniego bezpieczeństwa swoich danych na urządzeniach wykorzystywanych przez użytkownika. Odpowiedzialność za uszkodzenie lub utratę danych jest ograniczona do typowego wysiłku związanego z odzyskiwaniem danych, który byłby konieczny, gdyby kopie zapasowe były wykonywane regularnie i zgodnie z poziomem ryzyka oraz gdyby zastosowano odpowiednią ochronę antywirusową.

**7\. Odpowiedzialność i obowiązki klienta**

7.1. Jeśli użytkownik zakupi Członkostwo Premium i/lub inne płatne usługi bądź funkcje, zgadza się uiścić wszystkie opłaty określone w Warunkach subskrypcji (oraz, w stosownych przypadkach, wszelkie dodatkowe warunki, np. warunki korzystania ze sklepu z aplikacjami Apple/Google). Ponadto możemy nie świadczyć użytkownikowi Usługi do czasu dokonania takiej płatności oraz podjąć kroki w celu odzyskania zaległych opłat zgodnie z prawem. Użytkownik będzie również odpowiedzialny za wszelkie opłaty (a my je naliczymy) z tytułu obciążenia zwrotnego (na przykład od naszych dostawców usług płatniczych) lub wszelkie inne uzasadnione opłaty, które zostaną nałożone na nas w wyniku nieuiszczenia przez użytkownika uzgodnionych opłat.

7.2. Jak wspomniano powyżej, użytkownik jest odpowiedzialny za dokładność treści, które podaje podczas rejestracji, oraz za wszystkie informacje na swój temat, które podaje w swoim profilu. Przekazując nam te informacje, użytkownik zgadza się i potwierdza, że są one zgodne z prawdą i dokładne. My również podejmiemy kroki w celu zagwarantowania, że dane użytkownika są dokładne i aktualne.

7.3. Użytkownik wyraża zgodę, że nie będzie wykorzystywać żadnych treści dostarczonych mu przez nas i/lub poprzez korzystanie z naszych Usług, w tym informacji o stronach trzecich (w tym o innych członkach), do celów komercyjnych lub reklamowych. W szczególności zabrania się korzystania z metod lub procesów technologicznych w celu automatycznego pobierania lub uzyskiwania w inny sposób dostępu do informacji o innych członkach w celu wykorzystania tych informacji poza Usługą (np. przez program komputerowy lub kopiowanie i wklejanie treści). Użytkownik zgadza się również, że korzystanie z programów komputerowych w celu automatycznego odczytywania plików z danymi użytkowników (takich jak crawlery) jest zabronione.

Użytkownik będzie traktować wiadomości e-mail i inne wiadomości otrzymane za pośrednictwem Usługi lub w związku z nią jako poufne i nie będzie ujawniać tych wiadomości stronom trzecim bez zgody nadawcy lub bez poważnej przyczyny. Te same zasady mają również zastosowanie do wszelkich imion i nazwisk, numerów telefonów i faksów, adresów domowych, adresów e-mail i/lub adresów URL bądź innych danych osobowych innych członków.

7.6. Użytkownik wyraża zgodę, że będzie pobierać wszelkie otrzymane wiadomości (jak również wszelkie informacje zawarte w jego profilu, które chce zachować) w regularnych i odpowiednich odstępach czasu oraz że w razie potrzeby będzie archiwizować te informacje na własnym komputerze lub w innym systemie przechowywania danych. Użytkownik rozumie, że możemy usunąć wszelkie wiadomości przechowywane na jego koncie po upływie dwunastu miesięcy od daty otrzymania wiadomości, bez konieczności dalszego powiadamiania go o tym. Jeśli użytkownik jest członkiem podstawowym, rozumie, że wszystkie jego dane związane z bieżącym Członkostwem podstawowym zostaną automatycznie usunięte, jeśli jego profil będzie nieaktywny przez dwadzieścia cztery miesiące.

7.7. Każdy użytkownik jest zobowiązany do przestrzegania [Polityki dotyczącej treści i zachowania](https://terms.hi5.com/content-and-conduct). Ponadto użytkownikowi nie wolno:

**10\. Prawo właściwe / pozasądowe rozstrzyganie sporów konsumenckich**

10.1. Niniejsze Warunki korzystania z usługi podlegają prawu stanu Kalifornia w USA i będą interpretowane zgodnie z nim, bez względu na jakiekolwiek sprzeczne zasady prawa. Ten wybór prawa nie ma jednak zastosowania, jeśli skutkuje pozbawieniem użytkownika ochrony przyznanej na mocy przepisów, których nie można wyłączyć w drodze umowy na mocy prawa, a które w przypadku braku wyboru miałoby zastosowanie na podstawie przepisów ustawowych.

10.2. Zgodnie z obowiązującym prawem jesteśmy zobowiązani do informowania konsumentów o istnieniu europejskiej platformy internetowego rozstrzygania sporów, która została utworzona przez Komisję Europejską w celu rozstrzygania sporów. Europejska platforma internetowego rozstrzygania sporów jest dostępna tutaj: [https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/). Dane kontaktowe oficjalnych organów rozstrzygających spory można znaleźć pod następującym linkiem: [https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/odr/main/index.cfm](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/odr/main/index.cfm). W przypadku braku prawnego obowiązku uczestniczenia w postępowaniu prowadzonym przez organ rozstrzygający spory konsumenckie nie jesteśmy zobowiązani ani nie wyrażamy gotowości do uczestniczenia w takim postępowaniu rozstrzygającym spory. Nasz adres e-mail podano w punkcie 16.

10.3. Jeżeli którekolwiek z postanowień niniejszych Warunków korzystania z usługi jest lub będzie w całości lub częściowo nieskuteczne lub niewykonalne, nie wpłynie to na ważność pozostałych postanowień niniejszych Warunków korzystania z usługi.

**11\. Polityka anulowania/wycofania, wyłączenie prawa do anulowania**

11.1. Prawo do anulowania/wycofania

Użytkownik ma prawo odstąpić od umowy bez podania przyczyny w ciągu 14 dni od daty wysłania przez nas wiadomości e-mail z potwierdzeniem zakupu.

Aby skorzystać z prawa do anulowania, użytkownik musi powiadomić nas o tym za pośrednictwem dowolnej z metod kontaktu wyszczególnionych poniżej:

pocztą: The Meet Group, Inc., 100 Union Square Drive, New Hope, PA 18938, USA

pocztą elektroniczną: [support@themeetgroup.com](mailto:support@themeetgroup.com)

Użytkownik musi również dostarczyć nam wyraźne pisemne oświadczenie o swojej decyzji anulowania zakupu. Użytkownik może skorzystać z formularza anulowania dostępnego poniżej, jednak nie jest to obowiązkowe. Jeśli użytkownik nie chce skorzystać z tego formularza, należy dopilnować, aby decyzja zawierała informacje wymienione poniżej w punkcie 11.3.

11.2. Skutki anulowania

Jeśli użytkownik anuluje umowę w ciągu 14-dniowego okresu anulowania, zwrócimy mu wszystkie płatności, które od niego otrzymaliśmy, bez zbędnej zwłoki, a w każdym razie nie później niż w ciągu 14 dni od dnia, w którym zostaliśmy poinformowani o decyzji użytkownika o anulowaniu. Zwrot pieniędzy przekażemy za pomocą tych samych środków płatności, których użytkownik użył do pierwotnej transakcji, chyba że wyraźnie uzgodniono inaczej; użytkownik nie zostanie jednak obciążony kosztem tego zwrotu.

Należy jednak pamiętać, że jeśli użytkownik zaczął korzystać z zakupionych towarów lub usług w ciągu 14-dniowego okresu anulowania, będziemy uprawnieni do zatrzymania ze zwróconej płatności rozsądnej kwoty (rekompensaty za wartość), aby uwzględnić opłatę za tę część towarów lub usług, które użytkownik już otrzymał.

11.3. Należy pamiętać, aby podać adres e-mail powiązany z kontem użytkownika lub porównywalne dane logowania.

11.4. Punkty od 11.1 do 11.3 nie mają zastosowania do anulowania Członkostwa Premium zakupionego od Apple za pośrednictwem aplikacji z systemem iOS lub od Google za pośrednictwem aplikacji z systemem Android. Więcej informacji znajduje się w punkcie 2.4. Firma Apple/Google może również zapewnić dodatkowe mechanizmy umożliwiające anulowanie subskrypcji. Aby anulować Członkostwo Premium zakupione od Apple za pośrednictwem aplikacji z systemem iOS lub od Google za pośrednictwem aplikacji z systemem Android, należy zapoznać się z instrukcjami dotyczącymi anulowania, które udostępniono [tutaj](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202039) (Apple) i [**tutaj**](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481) (Google).

**12\. Prawa użytkownika**

Użytkownik ma prawo wymagać, aby Usługa była zgodna z opisem, odpowiednia do celu i zadowalającej jakości. Jeśli użytkownik zakupi Członkostwo Premium i treści, które mu dostarczamy, są wadliwe, użytkownik ma prawo do naprawy lub wymiany; lub, jeśli usterka nie może zostać naprawiona bądź nie może zostać naprawiona w rozsądnym czasie i bez znaczących niedogodności, może być uprawniony do pełnego lub częściowego zwrotu pieniędzy. Jeśli użytkownik może wykazać, że usterka uszkodziła jego urządzenie, a my nie wykazaliśmy należytej staranności i umiejętności, może być uprawniony do jego naprawy na nasz koszt lub odszkodowania.

16.2. Uzyskując dostęp do funkcji Pets i akceptując niniejsze warunki, użytkownik rozumie i zgadza się na udział w grze Pets dołączonej do Usługi. Użytkownik rozumie i zgadza się, że gra Pets umożliwia innym członkom dostęp do opisów i podobizn jego profilu, a ci członkowie mogą wykorzystywać te opisy i podobizny na różne sposoby. To wykorzystanie może obejmować wyznaczanie użytkownika i innych członków jako „zwierząt domowych”, które członkowie mogą „posiadać” i „sprzedawać” (za Towary wirtualne) innym członkom. Możemy określić „wartość” związaną z każdym zwierzęciem domowym na podstawie ustalonych przez nas kryteriów, które mogą obejmować liczbę i częstotliwość „sprzedaży” z udziałem tego zwierzęcia. Wartość przypisana do każdego zwierzęcia domowego może zmieniać się w czasie. Firma może publikować rankingi i inne dane, które zawierają odniesienia lub obliczenia wartości zwierząt domowych posiadanych przez członków. Stając się członkiem, użytkownik nieodwołalnie zezwala, upoważnia, udziela i licencjonuje nam oraz naszym podmiotom stowarzyszonym, następcom prawnym i cesjonariuszom prawo do korzystania i zezwalania innym, w tym innym członkom, na wykorzystywanie jego wizerunku, podobieństwa, wyglądu, informacji profilowych lub innych cech osobistych w związku z działaniem gry Pets lub innymi operacjami Usługi, bezterminowo, bez dalszej zgody użytkownika i bez tantiem, płatności lub innego wynagrodzenia.

Sjabloon voor het herroepingsformulier

**1\. Beschrijving van Dienst**

1.1. Nadat je je voor een account hebt geregistreerd, geven wij je toegang tot een online platform waar je andere geregistreerde klanten (ook wel leden genoemd) kunt leren kennen. De Dienst is alleen toegankelijk via mobiele apps op iOS- en Android-toestellen (hoewel er in de toekomst misschien andere besturingssystemen beschikbaar kunnen komen) of via onze Tagged- en/of Hi5-website (bepaalde functies zijn alleen beschikbaar via de mobiele app of op internet). De Dienst omvat een aantal gratis en een aantal betaalde diensten.

1.2. De Dienst bevat 'profielen' van leden die inhoud bevatten (ook wel 'gegevens' genoemd) die door deze leden beschikbaar is gesteld. Je vindt meer informatie over de soorten persoonlijke gegevens die we verzamelen en hoe deze gegevens aan andere leden beschikbaar worden gesteld in ons [Privacybeleid](https://secure.hi5.com/terms_of_service.html?#privacy_policy) (zie Clausule 5 hieronder). We bieden onze Dienst wereldwijd aan en onze leden kunnen naar andere leden zoeken en contact met ze opnemen in alle landen waarin we actief zijn.

**2\. Toegang tot de Dienst en het afsluiten van je Abonnement**

2.1. Om toegang te krijgen tot de Dienst en er gebruik van te maken, moet je je registreren. Om dit te doen, moet je een beschikbare registratieoptie kiezen, zoals e-mail, sms, Inloggen met Apple, Inloggen met Google of Facebook, en aanmeldgegevens opgeven, zoals een e-mailadres en een wachtwoord naar keuze. Je bent er zelf voor verantwoordelijk om je wachtwoord en accountgegevens vertrouwelijk te houden. Verder ben je ook verantwoordelijk voor alle verwijtbare activiteiten die via jouw account plaatsvinden. Je gaat ermee akkoord om ons onmiddellijk op de hoogte te stellen van elk onrechtmatig gebruik van je account of van enig ander beveiligingslek zodra je hiervan weet.

2.2. Wanneer je je geregistreerd hebt, krijg je toegang tot onze gratis Dienst ('Basislidmaatschap').

2.3. Wie bieden ook verschillende diensten of functies aan waarvoor je moet betalen. Voordat je je registreert om dergelijke diensten of functies te kopen, geven we je meer informatie over wat je gaat kopen, zoals, indien van toepassing: de belangrijkste kenmerken van de diensten of functies, de looptijd van je abonnement (inclusief eventuele verlenging), hoe je je abonnement kunt opzeggen, de prijs en eventuele betalingsvoorwaarden en beperkingen van de betaalmiddelen. Als je Virtuele Goederen koopt (zie Clausule 3.3 hieronder), informeren we je verder dat je deze alleen op de Dienst kunt inwisselen voor digitale producten en inhoud en dat ze niet kunnen worden terugbetaald. Als je je Basislidmaatschap wilt upgraden door voor een betaald lidmaatschap te kiezen ('Premium-lidmaatschap') of toegang wilt krijgen tot andere betaalde diensten of functies, erken je dat je door op de knop 'Nu kopen' (of een vergelijkbare knop) te drukken, je bevestigt dat je het Premium-lidmaatschap of de andere diensten of functies die je hebt geselecteerd wilt kopen. Onze contractuele relatie voor dergelijke aankopen wordt bevestigd op de datum waarop je een bevestiging van je bestelling ontvangt. Houd er echter rekening mee dat de uitvoering van je betalingsplicht jegens ons onderhevig is aan de verificatie en verwerking van de aankoop door de relevante betalingsdienstaanbieder.

2.4. Je kunt ook aankopen doen via onze Apple iOS-app of Google Android-app. Dit omvat de aankoop van een Premium-lidmaatschap of enige andere betaalde diensten of functies. In dit geval blijven wij verantwoordelijk voor de levering van onze Dienst. Je ontvangt een orderbevestiging over je Abonnementsvoorwaarden na een dergelijke aankoop. Maar alle aankopen en/of abonnementen worden uitsluitend afgesloten (en moeten worden geannuleerd of beëindigd) via Apple/Google (zie Clausule 5.3) en zijn onderworpen aan de technische standaarden en beginselen zoals vastgesteld door Apple/Google. Wij hebben hier geen controle over. In de regel vindt een aankoop via een app store plaats wanneer je op 'Nu kopen' (of een vergelijkbare knop) klikt en, indien vereist, je wachtwoord of vergelijkbare aanmeldgegevens voor de app store (zoals Touch ID of Face ID) invoert. Je contractuele relatie met Apple/Google wordt bevestigd op de datum waarop Apple/Google je een e-mail stuurt met een bevestiging van je bestelling. Apple/Google factureert je voor alle kosten voor je Premium-lidmaatschap via je Apple-/Google-account. In de app store vind je ook alle belangrijke informatie over je contractuele relatie met Apple/Google. Als je via de app store een Premium-lidmaatschap koopt dat automatisch verlengd wordt, heeft het Premium-lidmaatschap een vaste looptijd die automatisch wordt verlengd, tenzij je je abonnement bij Apple/Google beëindigt in overeenstemming met de Servicevoorwaarden van Apple/Google. Clausules 5.3 en 12 van deze Servicevoorwaarden zijn niet van toepassing indien je een Premium-lidmaatschap via Apple/Google hebt gekocht.

2.5. Zie ook Clausules 14 en 15 hieronder voor de voorwaarden die van toepassing zijn als je onze app via Apple of Google hebt gedownload. Als je onze app in de app store van Apple/Google gedownload hebt, zijn de servicevoorwaarden van Apple/Google van toepassing en hebben voorrang hebben over deze Servicevoorwaarden in geval van een conflict.

**3\. Gratis en betaalde Diensten en aankopen**

3.1. Je kunt je gratis voor de Dienst registreren en gebruikmaken van ons Basislidmaatschap.

3.2. Je kunt besluiten om je lidmaatschap te upgraden naar een Premium-status ('Premium-lidmaatschap') voor een aanvullend maandelijks bedrag. Als je ervoor kiest om een Premium-lidmaatschap te kopen, wordt je lidmaatschap automatisch maandelijks verlengd.

3.3. Je kunt 'Virtuele Goederen' kopen die je alleen op de Dienst kunt gebruiken (zoals virtueel 'Gold'). Aankopen of andere verwervingen van Virtuele Goederen bieden slechts een beperkte, niet overdraagbare, niet sublicentieerbare, volledig herroepbare licentie om dergelijke Virtuele Goederen te gebruiken voor toegang tot diensten die wij uitdrukkelijk beschikbaar stellen voor gebruik met dergelijke Virtuele Goederen voor jouw persoonlijke, niet-commerciële gebruik (zoals live animaties, zogenaamde virtuele 'Kado's'). Virtuele Goederen kunnen alleen op de Dienst worden ingewisseld tegen digitale producten en inhoud. Virtuele Goederen vervallen niet. Virtuele Goederen kunnen niet worden terugbetaald. Virtuele Goederen hebben geen geldelijke waarde en vormen geen valuta of eigendom van enig type. Virtuele Goederen zijn niet overdraagbaar of toewijsbaar. Je hebt geen recht op terugbetaling, geld of enige andere compensatie voor ongebruikte Virtuele Goederen wanneer een account wordt gesloten omdat je deze Servicevoorwaarden op ernstige wijze geschonden hebt of wanneer je besluit je account te sluiten.

3.4. Je kunt Virtuele Goederen gebruiken om Kado's te kopen voor andere gebruikers van onze app of andere apps die je kunt zien. De prijs van ieder Kado wordt weergegeven bij het aankooppunt. Kado's vormen een beperkte licentie voor toegang tot een bepaalde functie op de Dienst.

3.5. Af en toe kunnen we ook bepaalde aanvullende diensten aanbieden, zoals winkel- en e-commerceproducten en verschillende informatieve diensten.

3.6. We kunnen de Dienst wijzigen: (i) als gevolg van veranderingen in relevante wetten en wettelijke vereisten of (ii) om kleine technische veranderingen en verbeteringen te implementeren, bijvoorbeeld om een veiligheidsbedreiging aan te pakken (maar deze wijzigingen zijn niet van invloed op jouw gebruik van de Dienst). Daarnaast kunnen we, hoewel we op onze website een beschrijving van onze Dienst geven, de belangrijkste kenmerken van onze Dienst af en toe wijzigen, zonder extra kosten voor jou. Maar als we dit doen, stellen we je een redelijke periode voordat de verandering ingaat hiervan op de hoogte. Je kunt dan contact met ons opnemen om binnen 30 dagen na kennisgeving over een dergelijke verandering je abonnement op te zeggen als deze verandering je toegang tot de Diensten of je gebruik van de Diensten belemmert en als een dergelijke belemmering niet slechts onbeduidend is voordat de wijzigingen van kracht worden (en als je bij ons een Premium-lidmaatschap hebt afgesloten, ontvang je van ons een terugbetaling voor het gedeelte van de dienst waarvoor je betaald hebt, maar dat je niet hebt ontvangen omdat je je abonnement eerder hebt opgezegd). Een dergelijke kennisgeving informeert je over de aard van de verandering en de reden hiervoor, het moment waarop de verandering ingaat en je recht om je abonnement binnen 30 dagen na een dergelijke kennisgeving op te zeggen in overeenstemming met deze Clausule 3.6.

**4\. Gebruik van gegevens**

4.1. Je kunt meer informatie vinden over hoe we je persoonlijke gegevens gebruiken of anderszins verwerken en over onze verplichtingen in verband met gegevensbescherming in ons [Privacybeleid](https://secure.hi5.com/terms_of_service.html?#privacy_policy).

4.2. We streven er voortdurend naar om jou tegen overlast zoals aanvallen van hackers, spam of romantische fraude te beschermen. Hiervoor hebben we een groot aantal technische en organisatorische standaarden ontwikkeld. Het is jouw verantwoordelijkheid om de gebruikersrichtlijnen in Clausule 8 hieronder te volgen. Je kunt in geval van onregelmatigheden worden gecontacteerd door ons 'Team vertrouwen en veiligheid', om deze onregelmatigheden op te lossen. In dat geval vermelden we in detail om welke redenen we contact met je opnemen. Je bent verplicht om mee te werken en binnen een redelijke termijn op een dergelijk verzoek te reageren. Als we acties aanbevelen, moet je deze serieus overwegen. In geval je een aanbevolen actie afwijst, ben je verplicht om ons hierover binnen een redelijke termijn te informeren en de redenen op te geven waarom je onze voorgestelde actie afwijst. Je moet problematische inhoud of gedrag ook aan ons melden via de meldfunctie.

4.3. We kunnen onbeantwoorde berichten die vanaf of naar profielen verstuurd zijn en die als spam of romantische fraude geïdentificeerd of anderszins verwijderd zijn, automatisch verwijderen.

**5\. Beëindiging/verlenging**

**Zie Paragraaf 11 als je je Premium-abonnement wilt annuleren binnen de opzeg- of herroepingsperiode van 14 dagen (je recht om te annuleren).**

5.1. Je kunt je Basislidmaatschap op ieder moment met onmiddellijke ingang beëindigen in je accountinstellingen of door contact met ons op te nemen ([support@themeetgroup.com](mailto:support@themeetgroup.com)).

5.2. Als je Basislidmaatschap actieve Virtuele Goederen bevat, moet je de beëindiging aan ons doorgeven via [support@themeetgroup.com](mailto:support@themeetgroup.com). Verstrek daarbij het aan je account gekoppelde e-mailadres of vergelijkbare gegevens waarmee we je kunnen identificeren.

5.3. Als je op enig moment je Premium-lidmaatschap wilt beëindigen, staat het je vrij dit te doen. Als je Premium-lidmaatschapsaccount via onze website wordt gefactureerd, moet je naar [http://www.hi5.com/account\_info.html](http://www.hi5.com/account_info.html) gaan, op Abonnementen klikken en vervolgens op het tabblad Betalingen 'je abonnement opzeggen' selecteren en op 'Premium opzeggen' klikken. Je moet dit minimaal drie dagen voor je volgende geplande automatische betaling doen, zodat we je opzegging correct kunnen verwerken. Als je dat niet doet, kun je nog steeds aan het einde van de betreffende abonnementstermijn opzeggen, maar mogelijk innen we dan wel het geld voor de volgende termijn. Dit betalen we je vervolgens terug. Dit is niet van invloed op je recht om je Premium-lidmaatschap om andere redenen te beëindigen. In dat geval moet je de redenen voor buitengewone beëindiging aangeven wanneer je je abonnement op deze grond opzegt. Als je Premium-lidmaatschapsaccount via Apple wordt gefactureerd, moet je het minimaal 24 uur voor je volgende geplande automatische betaling opzeggen. Dit doe je door het proces te volgen dat hier [hier](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039) wordt beschreven. Als je Premium-lidmaatschapsaccount via Google Play wordt gefactureerd, moet je binnen zeven dagen na het begin van je factureringscyclus opzeggen door het proces te volgen dat [**hier**](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481) wordt uitgelegd. Je kunt ook naar ons schrijven via de contactgegevens die hieronder in Clausule 16 vermeld staan. Behoudens Clausule 5.5 en Clausule 11 hieronder gaat geen enkele beëindiging van je abonnement in voor het einde van de lopende factureringsperiode (en je hebt dan ook geen recht op enige terugbetaling). Om ervoor te zorgen dat je Premium-lidmaatschap niet automatisch wordt verlengd, moet je ons dus voor het einde van de dan lopende abonnementsperiode vertellen dat je je abonnement wilt beëindigen.

5.4. Als je je Basis- of Premium-lidmaatschap verwijdert, worden eerder gekochte Virtuele Goederen ook verwijderd en blijven bestaande betalingsverplichtingen die voortkomen uit de aanschaf van betaalde diensten of functies (zoals Virtuele Goederen) gelden, behoudens toepasselijke annuleringsrechten (zie Clausule 12).

5.5. Om je identiteit en je verzoek tot beëindiging te authenticeren, moet je het aan je account gekoppelde e-mailadres of andere persoonlijke gegevens verstrekken waarmee we je kunnen identificeren.

5.6. Als je ervoor kiest om een Premium-lidmaatschap te kopen, wordt je lidmaatschap automatisch maandelijks verlengd, tenzij je je abonnement in overeenstemming met deze paragraaf opzegt.

5.7. Als je je Premium-lidmaatschap beëindigt, wordt je account teruggezet naar een Basislidmaatschap. Als je je Basislidmaatschap wilt beëindigen, volg je de procedure die in Clausule 5.1 wordt beschreven.

5.8. Als je behoudens Clausule 5.4 en in overeenstemming met Clausule 3.6 je Premium-lidmaatschap wilt beëindigen omdat we je hebben verteld over een op handen zijnde substantiële verandering aan onze Dienst, wordt je abonnement onmiddellijk beëindigd wanneer we hiervan van jou schriftelijke kennisgeving (bijvoorbeeld een e-mail of fax) hebben ontvangen. We betalen je enig deel van je Premium-lidmaatschap terug dat we niet hebben geleverd. Als je je Premium-lidmaatschap via Apple/Google hebt gekocht, zal enige annulering en terugbetaling geschieden in overeenstemming met de eigen voorwaarden van Apple/Google, zoals verder beschreven in Clausules 2.4 en 5.3.

**6\. Functionaliteit, compatibiliteit, interoperabiliteit, garanties en aansprakelijkheid**

6.1. Hoewel we ons uiterste best doen, kunnen we niet garanderen dat de Dienst 100% van de tijd beschikbaar zal zijn. De beschikbaarheid van onze Dienst kan worden beperkt vanwege onderhoud en updates aan software of door periodes waarin de Dienst niet beschikbaar is vanwege technische of andere problemen die buiten onze macht liggen.

6.2. Sommige functies zijn alleen beschikbaar via de website of de app. Het is niet mogelijk om via onder meer de mobiele app toegang te krijgen tot of gebruik te maken van bepaalde functies, zoals Tags, Luv en het aanpassen van webprofielen. De Live-functie kun je alleen via de mobiele app bekijken en gebruiken.

6.3. Hoewel we onze Diensten gratis aanbieden op de mobiele websites, zijn de standaardtarieven van je mobiele provider nog steeds van toepassing. Je aanvaardt de verantwoordelijkheid voor alle kosten.

6.4. Om alles uit de Dienst te kunnen halen, moet je gebruikmaken van up-to-date (browser-)technologieën op je mobiele toestel of computer (zoals het inschakelen van JavaScript, cookies en pop-ups). Als je gebruikt maakt van een ouder besturingssysteem of internetprovider, kan je gebruik van de Dienst beperkt zijn. Wanneer je de app gebruikt, kunnen je mobiele toestel, besturingssysteem of geselecteerde instellingen bepaalde functies van de app (zoals pushberichten, zoeken op afstand) beperken.

6.5. In geval we productupdates aanbieden, waaronder updates voor onze Android- en iOS-apps, raden we je sterk aan deze zo snel mogelijk te installeren. Het is jouw verantwoordelijkheid om dergelijke updates binnen een redelijke termijn te installeren. Als je dit niet doet, hoewel we je ervan op de hoogte hebben gesteld dat er een update beschikbaar is en we je hebben geïnformeerd over de gevolgen als je deze niet installeert, zijn wij niet verantwoordelijk voor eventuele productgebreken die voortkomen uit het niet installeren van de update. Dit is niet van toepassing als je de update niet hebt geïnstalleerd of onjuist hebt geïnstalleerd als gevolg van ontoereikende installatie-instructies die wij aan jou hebben verstrekt.

6.6. Je bent verantwoordelijk voor de nauwkeurigheid van de gegevens die je tijdens je registratie hebt verstrekt. Als je je profiel of registratie-informatie moet bijwerken, kun je dit in principe op elk gewenst moment doen via je profiel. Maar er zijn gegevens die alleen kunnen worden bijgewerkt door contact met ons op te nemen via de gegevens in Clausule 16. We laten het ook aan je weten als je contact met ons moet opnemen om specifieke gegevens bij te werken.

6.7. We zijn alleen verantwoordelijk voor de technische levering van de Dienst (zoals verder beschreven in Clausule 3). We stellen je in principe in staat om contact te leggen met andere leden. We kunnen echter niet garanderen dat je als gevolg van je gebruik van de Dienst een partner zult vinden.

6.8. Hoewel we van onze leden verwachten dat ze de Dienst op een vriendelijke en respectvolle manier (en in overeenstemming met deze Servicevoorwaarden) gebruiken, zijn we niet verantwoordelijk voor eventueel misbruik van persoonlijke gegevens die via de Dienst beschikbaar zijn gesteld, voor enig gebruik van de Dienst door zijn leden dat in strijd is met deze Servicevoorwaarden of enig ander gebruik dat anderszins ongeoorloofd of onrechtmatig is. We zijn ook niet verantwoordelijk voor enig misbruik van gegevens of informatie door leden, niet-leden of derden in geval je deze derden van dergelijke informatie hebt voorzien. Maar zodra we op de hoogte worden gesteld van dergelijk misbruik of onwettigheid van Inhoud (zoals gedefinieerd in Clausule 9.2) via onze Diensten, nemen wij de noodzakelijke voorzorgsmaatregelen om toekomstig misbruik en andere inbreuken op deze Servicevoorwaarden en de toepasselijke wetten te voorkomen.

6.9. Hoewel we hard werken om een hoogwaardige dienst te leveren, kunnen we niet garanderen dat de Dienst altijd perfect werkt. We kunnen ook niet garanderen dat de Dienst altijd ononderbroken, veilig of vrij van fouten zal zijn. We zijn in het bijzonder niet aansprakelijk voor storingen die de toegankelijkheid van de Dienst aantasten in geval dergelijke storingen worden veroorzaakt door acties of gebeurtenissen die buiten onze macht liggen. Verder zijn we, hoewel we passende technische en organisatorische veiligheidsmaatregelen treffen om je persoonlijke gegevens te beschermen, voor zover toegestaan door de wet niet aansprakelijk voor enig ongeoorloofde toegang door derden tot je persoonlijke gegevens (bijvoorbeeld doordat hackers ongeoorloofde toegang tot onze database krijgen) als dit niet te wijten is aan een verwijtbare actie of verzuim van onze zijde, in het bijzonder het niet nemen van alle noodzakelijke voorzorgsmaatregelen om enige overtredingen van de toepasselijke wetten te voorkomen.

6.10. We zijn alleen aansprakelijk voor schade die voortvloeit uit het gebruik van de Diensten binnen het bestek van de wettelijke bepalingen, ongeacht de wettelijke gronden, in overeenstemming met de volgende bepalingen:

a) Wij zijn zonder beperking aansprakelijk voor schade die voortvloeit uit overlijden of persoonlijk letsel, evenals voor schade veroorzaakt door opzet of grove nalatigheid door ons, onze wettelijke vertegenwoordigers of plaatsvervangers, en voor schade veroorzaakt door het niet naleven van een door ons gegeven garantie of door onrechtmatig verborgen gebreken.

b) Voor alle andere schade die het gevolg is van een schending van essentiële contractuele verplichtingen die voortkomen uit eenvoudige nalatigheid door ons, onze wettelijke vertegenwoordigers of plaatsvervangers, is onze aansprakelijkheid op basis van de feiten van de zaak. Essentiële contractuele verplichtingen (kardinale verplichtingen) zijn verplichtingen waarvan het nakomen de correcte implementatie van het contract in de eerste plaats mogelijk maakt en op welk nakomen de contractuele partner normaal gesproken mag vertrouwen. In zulke gevallen zijn wij aansprakelijk voor een schadevergoeding ter hoogte van een gebruikelijk bedrag voor voorzienbare schade in een dergelijk contract. In andere gevallen is aansprakelijkheid uitgesloten.

c) De aansprakelijkheid onder de Duitse productaansprakelijkheidswet blijft onaangetast door bovenstaande bepalingen.

6.11. Je bent verplicht passende maatregelen te nemen om schade te voorkomen en te beperken, in het bijzonder om waar technisch mogelijk te zorgen voor passende beveiliging van je gegevens op je toestellen. De aansprakelijkheid voor beschadiging of verlies van gegevens is beperkt tot de gebruikelijke poging tot herstel die nodig zou zijn geweest als er regelmatig back-upkopieën zouden zijn gemaakt in overeenstemming met het risiconiveau en er voldoende virusbescherming zou zijn gebruikt.

**7\. Verantwoordelijkheid en plichten van de klant**

7.1. Als je een Premium-lidmaatschap en/of andere betaalde diensten of functies aanschaft, stem je ermee in alle kosten te betalen, zoals uiteengezet in de Abonnementsvoorwaarden (en indien van toepassing enige aanvullende voorwaarden, zoals de servicevoorwaarden van de app stores van Apple/Google). Daarnaast leveren we je de Dienst mogelijk niet tot een dergelijke betaling is gedaan en kunnen we stappen ondernemen om je openstaande betalingen terug te vorderen, zoals toegestaan door de wet. Je bent ook verantwoordelijk (en ontvangt van ons een rekening) voor enige terugboekingskosten (bijvoorbeeld van onze betalingsdienstaanbieders) of enige andere redelijke kosten die wij oplopen als gevolg van jouw verzuim de overeengekomen kosten te betalen.

7.2. Zoals hierboven vermeld, ben je verantwoordelijk voor de nauwkeurigheid van de inhoud die je bij registratie verstrekt en voor alle gegevens die je over jezelf verstrekt in je profiel. Door ons van deze gegevens te voorzien, ga je ermee akkoord en bevestig je dat deze gegevens waarheidsgetrouw en nauwkeurig zijn. We ondernemen ook stappen om te garanderen dat je gegevens nauwkeurig en up-to-date blijven. Opzettelijke en/of onrechtmatige misleiding wat betreft je identiteit, inclusief gebruik van een andere of fictieve identiteit, kan je ook blootstellen aan mogelijke wettelijke aansprakelijkheid.

7.3. Je stemt ermee in dat je de inhoud die wij je leveren en/of inhoud die door gebruik van onze Diensten wordt verkregen, inclusief gegevens over derden (inclusief andere leden) niet zult gebruiken voor commerciële of reclamedoeleinden. Het is in het bijzonder niet toegestaan om technologische methodes of processen te gebruiken om informatie over andere leden automatisch te downloaden of anderszins te bekijken om deze informatie buiten de Dienst te gebruiken (bijvoorbeeld door een computerprogramma of door de inhoud te kopiëren en te plakken). Je stemt er ook mee in dat het gebruik van computerprogramma's om bestanden met ledengegevens automatisch te lezen (zoals crawlers) verboden is.

7.4. Als je deze Servicevoorwaarden wezenlijk schendt of anderszins de wet overtreedt in verband met je gebruik van onze Dienst, kunnen we het recht hebben om schadevergoeding te eisen in overeenstemming met de toepasselijke wetgeving.

7.5. E-mails en andere berichten die je via of in verband met de Dienst ontvangt, behandel vertrouwelijk en maak je niet openbaar aan derden zonder toestemming van de afzender of een serieuze aanleiding. Deze zelfde regels zijn ook van toepassing op namen, telefoon- en faxnummers, adressen, e-mailadressen en/of url's of andere persoonlijke gegevens van andere leden.

7.6. Je stemt ermee in dat je berichten die je ontvangt (en informatie in je profiel die je wilt bewaren) regelmatig en met passende tussenpozen ophaalt en, indien noodzakelijk, dat je deze informatie op je eigen computer of een ander systeem voor gegevensopslag archiveert. Je begrijpt dat we in je account opgeslagen berichten na een periode van twaalf maanden, geteld vanaf de datum waarop het bericht was verzonden, kunnen verwijderen, zonder verdere kennisgeving aan jou. Als je een Basislid bent, begrijp je dat al je gegevens die betrekking hebben op je lopende Basislidmaatschap, automatisch worden verwijderd als je profiel meer dan vierentwintig maanden inactief is.

7.7. Iedere gebruiker is verplicht zich aan het [Inhouds- en gedragsbeleid](https://terms.hi5.com/content-and-conduct) te houden. Daarnaast is het niet toegestaan:

* om te proberen ongeautoriseerde toegang tot onze database of andere computersystemen te krijgen;
    
* te proberen enige door ons in verband met deze Dienst gebruikte softwareprogramma's te veranderen, vertalen, aanpassen, bewerken, decompileren, demonteren of reverse-engineeren;
    
* je in te laten met activiteiten die de Dienst verstoren, de kwaliteit ervan verminderen, invloed hebben op de prestaties van de Dienst of de functionaliteit ervan schaden;
    
* om op enig moment het account, de gebruikersnaam of het wachtwoord van een ander lid te gebruiken of diens wachtwoord aan derden bekend te maken of het enige derde partij toe te staan om toegang te krijgen tot diens account;
    
* om te proberen Virtuele Goederen buiten de Dienst te kopen;
    
* te proberen Virtuele Goederen te verkopen; en/of
    

7.8. te proberen een gebruikersaccount te verkopen dat gekoppeld is aan een van de Diensten. Als je je niet houdt aan de gedragseisen die in deze Clausule 7 worden uitgelegd of als je niet voldoet aan een wezenlijke verplichting in de Abonnementsvoorwaarden, kunnen we, als dit onder de omstandigheden van het specifieke geval redelijk is, een of meerdere van de volgende acties ondernemen: we kunnen je vragen te stoppen met je activiteiten die tegen de voorwaarden ingaan (of je anderszins een waarschuwing sturen dat je activiteiten niet voldoen aan onze gedragseisen); we kunnen enige inhoud die je via de Dienst hebt ingediend en die strijdig is met onze gedragseisen verwijderen; we kunnen de levering van de Dienst aan jou (geheel of gedeeltelijk) opschorten tot het probleem is opgelost (bijvoorbeeld terwijl we je activiteiten onderzoeken); of (als het ons duidelijk is dat je serieus misbruik maakt van de Dienst) we kunnen de levering van de Dienst aan jou stopzetten. Als je je Premium-lidmaatschap via Apple/Google hebt aangeschaft, vinden eventuele terugbetalingen plaats in overeenstemming met de eigen voorwaarden van Apple/Google zoals verder beschreven in Clausule 2.4.

**8\. Communicatie**

8.1. Communicatie op het platform moet altijd plaatsvinden in overeenstemming met deze Servicevoorwaarden, in het bijzonder de voorwaarden met betrekking tot veiligheid bij gebruik van de Dienst (zie Clausule 4) en het [Inhouds- en gedragsbeleid](https://terms.hi5.com/content-and-conduct).

8.2. Deze Diensten zijn online diensten. Als zodanig communiceren we over het algemeen met jou via online methoden zoals e-mail of via informatieschermen op onze mobiele apps en website. Als digitale dienst wordt onze Dienst alleen online geleverd. Daarom kun je je alleen online voor onze Dienst registreren, je abonneren en de Dienst gebruiken.

8.3. Om te garanderen dat we geen ongeoorloofde verzoeken ontvangen (en om je account tegen misbruik te beschermen), vragen we je om het je account gekoppelde e-mailadres of vergelijkbare inloggegevens te verstrekken, zodat we je kunnen identificeren.

**9\. Gebruiksrechten en auteursrecht**

9.1. Door onze Dienst te gebruik je, begrijp je en stem je ermee in dat wij de enige eigenaar zijn van alle rechten op en gerelateerd aan de Dienst, inclusief enige rechten op reproductie, distributie en verwerking, alle auteursrechten en het recht op immateriële overdracht en reproductie van de Tagged- en/of Hi5-website en de inhoud op deze websites. Het gebruik van alle programma's, inhoud, materialen, handelsmerken en handelsnamen binnen de Dienst is alleen toegestaan voor de doelen die in deze Servicevoorwaarden worden uiteengezet.

9.2. Door onze Dienst te gebruiken, begrijp je en stem je ermee in dat de Inhoud (gedefinieerd als alle gegevens, tekst, software, muziek, geluid, foto's, illustraties, video's, foto's, afbeeldingen, posts, uitzendingen, berichten of ander materiaal van welke aard dan ook, publiek geplaatst of privé verzonden) die door jou wordt gepubliceerd jouw eigen verantwoordelijkheid is. Je bent je ervan bewust dat als je Inhoud openbaar beschikbaar stelt, deze Inhoud door andere gebruikers kan worden gezien en dat andere gebruikers hier mogelijk misbruik van kunnen maken, oftewel de Inhoud kunnen gebruiken voor andere doeleinden dan waarvoor de Inhoud door jou beschikbaar is gesteld. Je verklaart en garandeert dat jij eigenaar bent of de noodzakelijke licenties, rechten, toestemmingen en machtigingen hebt om al je Inhoud te publiceren. We beschikken over systemen om de geplaatste Inhoud regelmatig te controleren op naleving van deze Servicevoorwaarden en de toepasselijke wetten, in het bijzonder om misbruik van je gegevens te voorkomen, maar we hebben de geplaatste Inhoud niet volledig onder controle en als zodanig hebben we ook de nauwkeurigheid, integriteit, kwaliteit of enig ander aspect ervan niet in de hand. Onder geen enkele omstandigheid zijn wij op enige wijze aansprakelijk voor enige Inhoud, inclusief maar niet beperkt tot enige fouten of lacunes in enige Inhoud of enige verliezen of schade van welke aard dan ook, opgelopen als gevolg van het gebruik van enige Inhoud.

9.3. Je geeft het Bedrijf hierbij het recht om dergelijke Inhoud (inclusief je gebruikersnaam en beeltenis) te distribueren, te reproduceren, vast te leggen, te wijzigen, aan te passen, te verwerken, te combineren, te synchroniseren, er afgeleide werken van te creëren, te publiceren, in het openbaar uit te voeren en in het openbaar weer te geven op de Diensten. Dit recht geldt alleen om onze Diensten aan jou te leveren in overeenstemming met deze Algemene voorwaarden.

9.4. Deze licentie geeft het Bedrijf het recht om je Inhoud beschikbaar te stellen aan de rest van de wereld en anderen hetzelfde te laten doen. Je gaat ermee akkoord dat deze licentie het recht van het Bedrijf omvat om de Diensten te leveren, te promoten en te verbeteren, en om de Inhoud die naar of via de Diensten wordt verzonden beschikbaar te stellen aan andere bedrijven, organisaties of personen voor de syndicatie, uitzending, distributie, promotie of publicatie van dergelijke Inhoud via andere media en diensten, behoudens de Servicevoorwaarden van het Bedrijf voor dergelijk gebruik van Inhoud. Dergelijk aanvullende gebruik door het Bedrijf of door andere bedrijven, organisaties of personen kan plaatsvinden zonder dat er een vergoeding aan jou betaald wordt in verband met de Inhoud die je verzendt, post, doorstuurt of anderszins ter beschikking stelt via de Diensten.

9.5. Het Bedrijf kan je feedback, reacties en suggesties gebruiken zonder enige verplichting om je daarvoor een vergoeding aan te bieden. Het Bedrijf kan alle Inhoud blijven gebruiken en beschikbaar stellen en het Bedrijf behoudt al deze rechten, zelfs als je account wordt beëindigd.

9.6. Je erkent en gaat ermee akkoord dat het Bedrijf niet belooft om de Inhoud die op de Dienst beschikbaar wordt gesteld regelmatig te screenen. Je begrijpt dat we enige door jou op de Dienst beschikbaar gestelde informatie of Inhoud kunnen verwijderen of weigeren te plaatsen als de Inhoud inbreuk maakt op deze Servicevoorwaarden of enige andere toepasselijke wet. We kunnen bijvoorbeeld Inhoud verwijderen als die inbreuk maakt op deze Servicevoorwaarden of anderszins aanstootgevend is. Je aanvaardt de aansprakelijkheid die gepaard gaat met enig gebruik van de Inhoud, inclusief maar niet beperkt tot je vertrouwen op de nauwkeurigheid, volledigheid of bruikbaarheid van dergelijke Inhoud. Je mag Inhoud op de Diensten die jou niet toebehoort niet reproduceren, opnieuw publiceren, verder distribueren of in het openbaar tentoonstellen.

**10\. Geldend recht/buitengerechtelijke geschillenbeslechting in consumentenzaken**

10.1. Deze Servicevoorwaarden worden beheerst door en geïnterpreteerd in overeenstemming met de wetten van de staat Californië in de VS, zonder rekening te houden met eventuele conflicterende rechtsbeginselen. Deze rechtskeuze is echter niet van toepassing als deze tot resultaat heeft dat je de bescherming wordt ontnomen die je wordt geboden door bepalingen waarvan niet kan worden afgeweken op grond van de wet die, bij gebreke van een rechtskeuze, van toepassing zou zijn geweest op basis van wettelijke bepalingen.

10.2. Onder de huidige wet zijn we verplicht om consumenten te informeren over het bestaan van het Europese platform voor onlinegeschillenbeslechting, dat is opgericht door de Europese Commissie voor geschillenbeslechting. Je kunt het Europese platform voor onlinegeschillenbeslechting hier vinden: [https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/). De contactgegevens van de officiële geschillenbeslechtingsorganen zijn te vinden via de volgende link: [https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/odr/main/index.cfm](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/odr/main/index.cfm). Bij gebrek aan een wettelijke verplichting om deel te nemen aan geschillenbeslechtingsprocedures bij een orgaan voor de beslechting van consumentengeschillen zijn wij niet verplicht en ook niet bereid om deel te nemen aan dergelijke geschillenbeslechtingsprocedures. Ons e-mailadres staat in Clausule 16.

10.3. Mocht een bepaling van deze Servicevoorwaarden geheel of gedeeltelijk ondoeltreffend of onuitvoerbaar zijn of worden, dan heeft dat geen invloed op de geldigheid van de overige bepalingen van deze Servicevoorwaarden.

**11\. Annulerings-/herroepingsbeleid, uitsluiting van het recht op annulering**

11.1. Recht op annulering/herroeping

Je hebt het recht om je contract, zonder opgaaf van redenen, te annuleren binnen 14 dagen vanaf de datum waarop we je een e-mail met een bevestiging van je aankoop sturen.

Om je recht op annulering uit te voeren, moet je ons via een van de onderstaande contactmethoden op de hoogte stellen:

per post: The Meet Group, Inc., 100 Union Square Drive, New Hope, PA 18938, VS

per e-mail: [support@themeetgroup.com](mailto:support@themeetgroup.com)

Je moet ons ook een duidelijke schriftelijke verklaring verstrekken van je beslissing om je aankoop te annuleren. Je kunt het modelannuleringsformulier hieronder gebruiken, maar dit is niet verplicht. Als je dit formulier liever niet gebruikt, zorg dan dat je ons de informatie verstrekt die hieronder in Clausule 11.3 vermeld staat.

11.2. Gevolgen van annulering

Als je je contract binnen de annuleringsperiode van 14 dagen annuleert, betalen we je alle betalingen die we van je hebben ontvangen terug, zonder onnodige vertraging en in ieder geval niet later dan 14 dagen, geteld vanaf de dag waarop we werden geïnformeerd over je beslissing om te annuleren. We betalen deze terugbetaling met hetzelfde betaalmiddel dat je voor de oorspronkelijke transactie hebt gebruikt, tenzij je uitdrukkelijk met iets anders hebt ingestemd; en er worden voor deze terugbetaling geen kosten in rekening gebracht.

Maar als je binnen de annuleringsperiode van 14 dagen bent begonnen de gekochte goederen of diensten te gebruiken, dan hebben we het recht om een redelijk bedrag (waardecompensatie) van de terugbetaalde betaling in te houden voor dat gedeelte van de goederen of diensten dat je al hebt ontvangen.

11.3. Zorg dat je het aan je account gekoppelde e-mailadres of vergelijkbare aanmeldgegevens verstrekt.

11.4. Clausule 11.1 tot en met 11.3 zijn niet van toepassing op de annulering van Premium-lidmaatschappen die bij Apple zijn gekocht via de iOS-app of bij Google via de Android-app. Zie Clausule 2.4 voor meer informatie. Apple/ Google biedt mogelijk ook andere mechanismen waarmee je je abonnement kunt annuleren. Zie voor het annuleren van je Premium-lidmaatschap dat bij Apple via de iOS-app of bij Google via de Android-app is gekocht, hun instructies om op te zeggen. Deze vind je voor Apple [hier](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202039) en voor Google [**hier**](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481).

Az elállási nyomtatvány sablonja

**1\. A Szolgáltatás leírása**

1.1. Miután fiókot regisztrált, hozzáférést biztosítunk egy online platformhoz, ahol megismerheti a többi regisztrált ügyfelet (más néven a tagokat). A Szolgáltatás csak mobilalkalmazásokon keresztül érhető el iOS és Android eszközökön (bár a jövőben más operációs rendszerek is elérhetőek lehetnek), illetve a Tagged és/vagy Hi5 weboldalunkon keresztül (kérjük, vegye figyelembe, hogy egyes funkciók csak a mobilalkalmazáson vagy az interneten keresztül érhetőek el); és a Szolgáltatás tartalmaz ingyenes és fizetős szolgáltatásokat is.

1.2. A Szolgáltatás tartalmazza a tagok „profilját”, amelyek az adott tagok által rendelkezésre bocsátott tartalmat (más néven „adatokat”) foglalnak magukban. További információkat találhat az [Adatvédelmi szabályzatunkban](https://secure.hi5.com/terms_of_service.html?#privacy_policy) arról, hogy milyen típusú személyes adatokat gyűjtünk, és hogy ezeket az adatokat miként tesszük hozzáférhetővé a többi tag számára (lásd az alábbi 5. pontot). Szolgáltatásunkat globálisan biztosítjuk; tagjaink számára lehetőség van arra, hogy bármely országban, ahol tevékenységünket végezzük, további tagokat keressenek meg és kapcsolatba lépjenek velük.

**2\. A szolgáltatáshoz való hozzáférés és az előfizetés lépései**

2.1. A Szolgáltatáshoz történő hozzáférésért és használatáért regisztrálnia kell. Ehhez ki kell választania az egyik rendelkezésre álló regisztrációs lehetőséget, mint például e-mail, SMS, Bejelentkezés Apple-lel, Bejelentkezés Google-lal vagy Facebookkal, és meg kell adnia a bejelentkezési adatokat, például az e-mail-címét és az Ön által választott jelszót. Jelszavának és fiókadatainak titokban tartásáért Ön felelős. Továbbá, Ön felelős minden olyan tevékenységért, amelyet hibásan okozott, amely az Ön fiókjában történik. Ön beleegyezik , hogy azonnal tájékoztat minket a fiókja jogosulatlan használatáról vagy a biztonság bármilyen más megsértéséről, amint arról tudomást szerez.

2.2. A sikeres regisztrációt követően hozzáférést kap ingyenes Szolgáltatásunkhoz („Alapszintű tagság”).

2.3. Különféle díjköteles szolgáltatásokat vagy funkciókat is kínálunk. Mielőtt ezen szolgáltatások vagy funkciók megvásárlására regisztrálna, további információkat adunk Önnek arról, hogy mit fog megvásárolni, például adott esetben: a szolgáltatások vagy funkciók főbb jellemzői, az előfizetés időtartama (beleértve az esetleges meghosszabbítást), az előfizetés megszüntetésének módja, az ár, valamint a fizetési feltételek és a fizetési módok feltételei. Amennyiben Ön virtuális termékeket vásárol (lásd az alábbi 3.3. pontot), tájékoztatjuk továbbá arról is, hogy ezek kizárólag a Szolgáltatásban válthatóak be digitális árucikkekre és tartalomra, és nem válthatók vissza. Ha Ön az Alapszintű tagságát díjköteles tagságra („Premium tagság”) kívánja frissíteni, vagy bármely más díjköteles szolgáltatáshoz vagy funkcióhoz kíván hozzáférni, tudomásul veszi, hogy a „Vásárlás most” gomb (vagy hasonló gomb) megnyomásakor megerősíti, hogy meg kívánja vásárolni a Premium tagságot vagy az Ön által kiválasztott egyéb szolgáltatásokat vagy funkciókat. Az ilyen vásárlásokra vonatkozó szerződéses viszonyunk azzal a dátummal kerül megerősítésre, amikor Ön megkapja a megrendelés visszaigazolását. Ugyanakkor felhívjuk figyelmét, hogy az Ön fizetési kötelezettségének teljesítése a vásárlást ellenőrző és feldolgozó adott fizetési szolgáltatótól függ.

2.4. Vásárolhat Apple iOS vagy a Google Android alkalmazásban is. Ez magában foglalja a Premium tagság vagy bármely más díjköteles szolgáltatás vagy funkció megvásárlását. Ebben az esetben továbbra is mi felelünk a Szolgáltatás nyújtásáért. Ön a vásárlást követően megrendelési visszaigazolást kap az előfizetési feltételekről. Azonban minden vásárlás és/vagy előfizetés kizárólag az Apple/Google-on keresztül köthető (és mondható le vagy szüntethető meg) (lásd 5.3. pont), és az Apple/Google által meghatározott technikai szabványok és elvek hatálya alá tartozik, amelyekre nincs ráhatásunk. Általános szabályként vásárlás egy alkalmazás-áruházon keresztül akkor valósul meg, amikor Ön a „Vásárlás most” gombra (vagy hasonló gombra kattint, és ha szükséges, megadja a jelszavát vagy az alkalmazás-áruházhoz tartozó egyenértékű hitelesítő adatokat (pl. Touch ID vagy Face ID)). Az Ön szerződéses kapcsolata az Apple-lel/Google-lel azon a napon kerül megállapításra, amikor az Apple/Google e-mailben visszaigazolást küld a megrendeléséről; és az Apple/Google az Apple/Google-fiókján keresztül kiállítja Önnek a Premium tagsággal kapcsolatos számlákat. Az alkalmazás-áruházban minden olyan lényeges információt megtalál, amire szüksége lesz az Apple-lel/ Google-lel létrejött szerződéses kapcsolatról. Ha Ön az alkalmazás-áruházon keresztül olyan Premium tagságot vásárol, amely automatikusan meghosszabbodik, a Prémium tagság határozott időtartamra szól, amely automatikusan meghosszabbodik, kivéve, ha Ön az Apple/Google szolgáltatási feltételeivel összhangban felmondja az előfizetését.Felhívjuk figyelmét, hogy a jelen Szolgáltatási feltételek 5.3. és 12. pontjai nem alkalmazandók, ha Ön az Apple-ön /Google-ön keresztül vásárolta meg a Premium tagságot.

2.5. Kérjük, tekintse meg az alábbi 14. és 15. pontot is azokról a feltételekről, amelyek akkor alkalmazandók, ha Ön az alkalmazásunkat az Apple-ről vagy a Google-ról töltötte le. Kérjük, ne feledje , hogy ha Ön az alkalmazásunkat az Apple/Google alkalmazás-áruházból töltötte le, akkor az Apple/Google alkalmazás-áruházának szolgáltatási feltételei érvényesek, és azok a jelen Szolgáltatási feltételekhez képest elsőbbséget élveznek bármilyen ellentmondás esetén.

**3\. Ingyenes és díjköteles szolgáltatások és vásárlások**

3.1. A Szolgáltatásra és az Alapszintű tagság használatára történő regisztráció ingyenes.

3.2. Ön választhatja a tagság Premium státuszra való frissítését („Premium tagság”) további havidíj ellenében. Ha úgy határoz, hogy Premium tagságot vásárol, a tagsága havonta automatikusan megújul.

3.3. Ön kizárólag a Szolgáltatásban történő használatra vásárolhat „virtuális termékeket” (pl. virtuális „aranyat”). A Virtuális áruk vásárlása vagy egyéb módon történő megszerzése csak egy korlátozott, nem átruházható, nem engedményezhető, teljes mértékben visszavonható licencet ad az ilyen Virtuális termékek használatára, hogy olyan szolgáltatásokhoz férjen hozzá, amelyeket kifejezetten az Ön személyes, nem kereskedelmi célú használatára bocsátunk rendelkezésre az ilyen Virtuális termékekkel (például élő animációk, úgynevezett Virtuális „Ajándékok”). A Virtuális termékek kizárólag a Szolgáltatásban válthatók be digitális árucikkekre és tartalmakra. A Virtuális termékeknek nincs lejárati ideje. A Virtuális termékek nem visszatéríthetőek. A Virtuális termékeknek nincs pénzértéke, és nem minősülnek sem pénznek, sem bármilyen tulajdonnak. A Virtuális termékeket nem lehet átruházni vagy engedményezni. Ön nem jogosult visszatérítésre, pénzre vagy bármilyen más kompenzációra a fel nem használt virtuális termékek után, ha a fiók a jelen Szolgáltatási feltételek súlyos megsértése miatt bezárásra kerül, vagy ha Ön úgy dönt, hogy bezárja a fiókját.

3.4. Ön virtuális áruk felhasználásával ajándékokat vásárolhat alkalmazásunk felhasználóinak, vagy más, az Ön számára látható alkalmazások felhasználóinak. Az egyes ajándékok ára a vásárlás helyén jelenik meg. Az ajándékok a Szolgáltatás egy bizonyos funkciójához való hozzáférésre vonatkozó korlátozott engedélyt képviselnek

3.5. Időről időre kínálhatunk bizonyos további szolgáltatásokat is, mint például vásárlási és e-kereskedelmi ajánlatokat és különféle információs szolgáltatásokat.

3.6. A Szolgáltatást módosíthatjuk azért, hogy: (i) a vonatkozó törvények és szabályozási követelmények változásait megjelenítsük; vagy (ii) kisebb technikai beállításokat és fejlesztéseket hajtsunk végre, például egy biztonsági fenyegetés orvoslása érdekében (ezek a módosítások azonban nem befolyásolják a Szolgáltatás Ön általi használatát). Továbbá, bár Szolgáltatásunkról leírást biztosítunk a weboldalunkon, időről időre megváltoztathatjuk Szolgáltatásunk főbb jellegzetességeit , anélkül, hogy ez Önre költségeket róna. Ugyanakkor ha így járunk el, akkor erről észszerű időn belül értesítjük Önt a változás hatályba lépése előtt; Ön ezután kapcsolatba léphet velünk, hogy megszüntesse előfizetését a változásról érkezett tájékoztatástól számított 30 napon belül , amennyiben a változás rontja a Szolgáltatásokhoz való hozzáférését vagy a Szolgáltatások használhatóságát, és ha a romlás nem csupán jelentéktelen a változások hatályba lépése előtt (és, abban az esetben, ha Ön Premium tagsággal fizetett elő rajtunk keresztül, Ön visszatérítésben részesül a szolgáltatásnak azon részére, amelyért ugyan fizetett , de nem vett igénybe az előfizetés korábbi megszűnése miatt). Minden ilyen értesítésben tájékoztatjuk Önt a változás természetéről és okairól, a változás hatálybalépésének időpontjáról, valamint azon jogáról, miszerint az előfizetést az értesítéstől számított 30 napon belül a jelen 3.6. pontnak megfelelően felmondhatja.

**4\. Az adatok felhasználása**

4.1. További információkat olvashat arról, hogy miként használjuk vagy kezeljük az Ön személyes adatait, és milyen kötelezettségeink vannak az adatvédelemmel kapcsolatban az [Adatvédelmi szabályzatunkban](https://secure.hi5.com/terms_of_service.html?#privacy_policy).

4.2. Folyamatosan törekszünk arra, hogy megvédjük Önt az olyan zaklatásoktól, mint a hackertámadások, a spam vagy a romantikus szélhámosság. Ebből a célból számos technikai és szervezeti előírást dolgoztunk ki. Az Ön felelőssége az, hogy betartsa az alábbi 8. pontban megfogalmazott felhasználói előírásokat. Előfordulhat, hogy a „Bizalmi és biztonsági csapatunk” kapcsolatba lép Önnel adott esetben, az ilyen természetű problémák megoldása érdekében. Ebben az esetben részletesen ismertetjük a kapcsolatfelvétel okát, Önnek pedig kötelessége, hogy együttműködjön és válaszoljon a megkereséstől számított észszerű időn belül. Ha intézkedéseket javasolunk, komolyan fontolóra kell azokat vennie. Ha Ön elutasít egy javasolt intézkedést, kötelessége erről észszerű időn belül tájékoztatni minket, és megnevezni az általunk javasolt intézkedés elutasításának okait. A problémás tartalmat vagy viselkedést a bejelentés funkció útján is jelentenie kell felénk.

4.3. Automatikusan törölhetjük azokat a válasz nélküli üzeneteket, amelyeket olyan profilok vagy a profiloknak küldtek, és amelyeket spamként vagy romantikus csalásként azonosítottunk, vagy amelyek más módon törlésre kerültek.

**5\. Megszüntetés/hosszabbítás**

**Kérjük, olvassa el a 11. szakaszt, amennyiben a Premium tagságot a 14 napos felmondási/„gondolkodási” időszakon belül szeretné lemondani (az Ön felmondási joga).**

5.1. Az Alapszintű tagságot bármikor azonnali hatállyal felmondhatja a fiókbeállítások alatt, vagy ha kapcsolatba lép velünk ([support@themeetgroup.com](mailto:support@themeetgroup.com)).

5.2. Ha az Alapszintű tagságának aktív virtuális termékekkel rendelkezik, akkor a felmondásról értesítenie kell bennünket a [support@themeetgroup.com](mailto:support@themeetgroup.com) címen. Ügyeljen arra , hogy megadja a fiókjához kapcsolódó e-mail címet vagy hasonló hitelesítő adatokat, hogy be tudjuk Önt azonosítani.

5.3. Ha szeretné megszüntetni a Premium tagságát, azt bármikor megteheti, amikor az Önnek megfelel. Ha a Premium tagsági fiókját a weboldalunkon keresztül számlázzuk, akkor keresse fel a [http://www.hi5.com/account\_info.html](http://www.hi5.com/account_info.html) oldalt, kattintson az Előfizetések és Fizetések fülre, válassza az „Előfizetés törlése” lehetőséget, majd kattintson a „Prémium tagság törlése” gombra legalább három nappal a következő esedékes automatikus fizetés előtt, hogy megfelelően fel tudjuk dolgozni a törlési kérelmet. Ha nem így jár el, a tagságot így is lemondhatja az adott előfizetési időszak végéig, azonban a következő időszakra vonatkozóan még bevételezhetjük az összeget, amelyet aztán visszatérítünk Önnek. Ez nem érinti az Ön arra vonatkozó jogát, hogy egyéb okokból megszüntesse Premium tagságát. Ebben az esetben meg kell neveznie a rendkívüli felmondás indokait, ha ezen az alapon mondja fel az előfizetést. Ha a Premium tagsági fiókját az Apple-ön keresztül számlázzák, akkor a következő tervezett automatikus fizetés előtt legalább 24 órával le kell mondania az előfizetést, követve az [itt](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039) leírt folyamatot. Ha a Premium tagsági fiókját a Google-ön keresztül számlázzák, akkor a számlázási ciklus kezdetétől számított hét napon belül le kell mondania az előfizetést, követve az [**itt**](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481) leírt folyamatot. Akár írhat is nekünk az alábbi 16. pontban megadott elérhetőségeken. Az 5.5. és az alábbi 11. pontra tekintettel, az Ön előfizetésének megszüntetése csak az aktuális számlázási időszak végéig lép hatályba (és mint ilyen, Ön nem jogosult visszatérítésre). Így annak érdekében, hogy a Premium tagsága ne hosszabbodjon meg automatikusan, tájékoztatnia kell minket arról, hogy az aktuális előfizetési időszak lejárta előtt meg kívánja szüntetni az előfizetését.

5.4. Amennyiben törli az Alapszintű vagy Premium tagságát, a korábban vásárolt virtuális termékek szintén törlődnek, és a fizetős szolgáltatások vagy funkciók (például a virtuális termékek) megvásárlásából fennálló fizetési kötelezettségek továbbra is érvényben maradnak, az alkalmazandó lemondási jogok függvényében (lásd a 12. pontot).

5.5. Személyazonosságának és a felmondási kérelmének hitelesítéséhez meg kell adnia a fiókjához kapcsolódó e-mail-címet vagy más személyes adatokat, hogy be tudjuk Önt azonosítani.

5.6. Ha úgy dönt, hogy Premium tagságot vásárol, a tagsága havonta automatikusan meghosszabbodik, kivéve, ha a jelen szakasznak megfelelően lemondja az előfizetést.

5.7. A Premium tagság megszüntetésével a fiók visszaáll az Alapszintű tagságra. Ha meg kívánja szüntetni az Alapszintű tagságát, kérjük, kövesse az 5.1. pontban meghatározott folyamatot.

5.8. Az 5.4. pontra is tekintettel és a 3.6. pontnak megfelelően, amennyiben Ön azért kívánja megszüntetni a Premium tagságát, mert közöltük Önnel, hogy a Szolgáltatásunkban lényeges változás következik be, az előfizetése azonnal megszűnik, miután megkaptuk a felmondási nyilatkozatát szöveges formában (például e-mailben vagy faxon), és visszatérítjük Önnek a Premium tagság azon hányadát , amelyet nem szolgáltattunk. Ha a Premium tagságot Apple/Google-ön keresztül vásárolta, a lemondás és a visszatérítés az Apple/Google saját feltételei szerint kerül végrehajtásra a 2.4. és 5.3. pontban leírtak szerint.

**6\. 6. A működőképesség, kompatibilitás, átjárhatóság, garanciák és felelősség**

6.1. Kérjük, tartsa szem előtt, hogy bár minden tőlünk telhetőt megteszünk, nem tudjuk azt garantálni, hogy a Szolgáltatás az idő 100%-ában elérhető lesz. Előfordulhat, hogy a Szolgáltatásunk elérhetősége csökken karbantartás és szoftverfrissítés miatt, valamint olyan időszakok alkalmával, amikor a Szolgáltatás nem elérhető olyan technikai vagy egyéb problémák miatt, amelyek nem állnak az irányításunk alatt.

6.2. Egyes funkciók csak a weboldalon vagy az alkalmazásban érhetőek el. A mobilalkalmazáson keresztül nem lehetséges többek között bizonyos funkciók, például a Tags, a Luv és a Webprofil testreszabása, elérése vagy használata). Az Élő funkció csak a mobilalkalmazáson keresztül érhető el és használható.

6.3. Habár Szolgáltatásainkat a mobil weboldalakon keresztül ingyenesen nyújtjuk, az Ön mobilszolgáltatójának szokásos díjai és tarifái továbbra is alkalmazandók. Ön elfogadja a díjak vonatkozásában a felelősséget.

6.4. Ahhoz, hogy a Szolgáltatást teljes körűen tudja használni, a mobileszközén vagy számítógépén a legfrissebb (böngésző) technológiákat kell használnia (pl. engedélyezni kell a Java scriptet, a cookie-kat, a felugró ablakokat). Ha régebbi operációs rendszert vagy internetszolgáltatót használ, a Szolgáltatásokat korlátozott mértékben tudja csak használni. Az alkalmazás használatakor a mobileszköz, az operációs rendszer vagy a kiválasztott beállítások korlátozhatják az alkalmazás bizonyos funkcióit (pl. push-üzenetek, távolságkeresés).

6.5. Ha termékfrissítéseket kínálunk, beleértve az Android- és iOS-alkalmazásaink frissítését, kifejezetten javasoljuk, hogy azokat a lehető leghamarabb telepítse. Az Ön felelőssége, hogy ezeket a frissítéseket észszerű időn belül feltelepítse. Ha nem így jár el annak ellenére, hogy tájékoztattuk Önt a frissítés elérhetőségéről, illetve a következményekről, melyek a frissítés telepítésének elmulasztásával járnak, akkor nem vállalunk felelősséget a termék azon hibáiért, amelyek a frissítés telepítésének elmulasztásából erednek; ez nem vonatkozik arra a tényre, hogy Ön nem vagy nem megfelelően telepítette a frissítést az Ön általunk megadott helytelen telepítési utasítások miatt.

6.6. A regisztráció során megadott információk pontosságáért Ön felel. Ha frissítenie kell a profilját vagy a regisztrációs adatait, ezt általánosságban bármikor megteheti a profilján keresztül. Vannak azonban olyan információk, amelyeket csak úgy frissíthet, ha a 16. pontban megadott elérhetőségeken kapcsolatba lép velünk. Azt egyértelműen jelezni fogjuk Önnek, ha kapcsolatba kell lépnie velünk bizonyos információk frissítése érdekében.

6.7. Mi csak a Szolgáltatás technikai nyújtásáért vagyunk felelősek (a 3. pontban leírtak szerint). Általánosságban lehetővé tesszük, hogy más tagokkal kapcsolatba léphessen. Azt azonban nem tudjuk garantálni, hogy a Szolgáltatás használatával Ön partnerre talál.

6.8. Bár számítunk arra, hogy tagjaink kedvesen és tisztelettudóan (és a jelen Szolgáltatási feltételeknek megfelelően) használják a Szolgáltatást, nem vagyunk felelősek a Szolgáltatásban elérhetővé tett személyes adatokkal való visszaélésért; a Szolgáltatásnak a tagok által történő bármely más, a jelen Szolgáltatási feltételekkel ellentétes használatáért; vagy bármely más módon történő jogosulatlan vagy jogellenes használatért. Nem tartozunk felelősséggel az adatokkal vagy információkkal való visszaélésekért sem a tagok, sem a nem tagok, sem harmadik felek részéről, amennyiben Ön szolgáltatta az információt a harmadik félnek. Mindazonáltal, amint tudomást szerzünk a Szolgáltatásainkon keresztül a Tartalommal kapcsolatos (a 9.2. pontban meghatározottak szerinti) ilyen visszaéléséről vagy jogellenességéről, megtesszük a szükséges óvintézkedéseket annak érdekében, hogy megakadályozzuk a jövőbeni visszaéléseket és a jelen Szolgáltatási feltételek és a vonatkozó jogszabályok más megsértését.

6.9. Bár keményen dolgozunk a magas színvonalú szolgáltatás biztosítása érdekében, nem garantáljuk, hogy a Szolgáltatás mindig tökéletesen fog működni, és nem tudjuk biztosítani, hogy a Szolgáltatás mindenkor zavartalan, biztonságos vagy hibamentes legyen. Különösen nem vagyunk felelősek az olyan fennakadásokért, amelyek befolyásolják a Szolgáltatás hozzáférhetőségét, amennyiben az ilyen fennakadásokat olyan tevékenységek vagy események okozzák, amelyek kívül esnek az irányításunkon. Továbbá, bár megfelelő technikai és szervezeti biztonsági intézkedéseket teszünk az Ön személyes adatainak védelme céljából, a jogszabályok által megengedett legteljesebb mértékben nem vállalunk felelősséget az Ön személyes adataihoz harmadik fél által történő jogosulatlan hozzáférésért (pl. hackerek adatbázisunkhoz való illetéktelen hozzáférése miatt), ha ez nem a részünkre felróható cselekmény vagy mulasztás, különösen ha az alkalmazandó jogszabályok megsértésének megelőzése érdekében szükséges óvintézkedések elmulasztása miatt következik be.

6.10. A Szolgáltatások használatából eredő károkért a jogszabályi rendelkezések hatályán belül, a jogalapra való tekintet nélkül, kizárólag a következő rendelkezések szerint felelünk:

a) Korlátozás nélkül felelünk a halál vagy személyi sérülés miatt bekövetkezett károkért, a szándékos vagy súlyos gondatlanságunk, törvényes képviselőink vagy megbízottjaink által okozott károkért, továbbá az általunk vállalt garancia be nem tartása vagy tudatosan elhallgatott hibák miatt bekövetkezett károkért.

b) Minden egyéb, a lényeges szerződéses kötelezettségek megszegéséből származó, általunk, törvényes képviselőink vagy megbízottjaink által elkövetett egyszerű gondatlanságból eredő kár esetén a felelősségünk az ügy jellege alapján áll fenn. A lényeges szerződéses kötelezettségek (sarkalatos kötelezettségek) olyan kötelezettségek, amelyek teljesítése lehetővé teszi a szerződés megfelelő teljesítését, és amelyek teljesítésére a szerződő fél rendes körülmények között számíthat. Ilyen esetekben a szerződésben az előre látható károkért a szokásos kártérítési összeggel felelünk. A felelősség egyebekben kizárt.

c) A német termékfelelősségi törvény szerinti felelősséget a fenti rendelkezések nem érintik.

6.11. Ön köteles megfelelő intézkedéseket tenni a károk megelőzése és enyhítése végett, különösen az Ön eszközein lévő adatok megfelelő biztonságának garantálása érdekében, amennyire ez technikailag lehetséges. Az adatok sérüléséért vagy adatvesztésért a felelősség csak arra a szokásos helyreállítási műveletre korlátozódik, amelyre akkor lett volna szükség, ha rendszeresen és a kockázat mértékének megfelelően biztonsági másolatok készülnek megfelelő vírusvédelmet alkalmaznak.

**7\. Az Ügyfél felelőssége és kötelezettségei**

7.1. Ha Premium tagságot és/vagy egyéb díjköteles szolgáltatásokat vagy funkciókat vásárol, vállalja, hogy az Előfizetési feltételekben meghatározott valamennyi díjat megfizeti (és adott esetben bármely további feltételben, pl. az Apple/Google alkalmazás-áruház feltételeiben). Továbbá nem tudunk Önnek Szolgáltatást biztosítani amíg a fizetés meg nem történik, és a törvény által megengedett módon lépéseket tehetünk a kintlévőségek behajtása érdekében. Önt terheli továbbá (és mi felszámítjuk Önnek) minden olyan visszaterhelési díj (például a fizetési szolgáltatóinktól) vagy minden egyéb észszerű díj, amelyet a megállapodás szerinti díjak Ön általi meg nem fizetése miatt vetnek ki ránk.

7.2. Mint fentebb említettük, Ön felelős a regisztráció során megadott tartalmak pontosságáért és minden olyan információért, amelyet a profiljában önmagáról megad. Azzal, hogy megadja nekünk ezeket az információkat, Ön elfogadja és kijelenti, hogy azok a valóságnak megfelelnek és pontosak. Lépéseket teszünk annak biztosítására is, hogy az Ön adatai pontosak és naprakészek maradjanak. Az Ön személyazonosságának szándékos és/vagy csalárd meghamisítása, beleértve egy másik vagy fiktív személyazonosság használatát is, esetleges jogi felelősségvonással járhat.

7.3. Ön vállalja, hogy nem használja fel az általunk és/vagy a Szolgáltatásaink használata során rendelkezésére bocsátott tartalmakat – beleértve a harmadik felekre (beleértve más tagokat is) vonatkozó információkat –kereskedelmi vagy reklámcélokra. Ön különösen nem alkalmazhat olyan technológiai módszereket vagy eljárásokat, amelyekkel automatikusan letölthet vagy más módon hozzáférhet más tagokra vonatkozó információkhoz , annak érdekében, hogy ezeket az információkat a Szolgáltatáson kívül használja fel (pl. számítógépes programmal vagy a tartalom másolásával és beillesztésével). Ön elfogadja továbbá, hogy számítógépes programok használata a tagok adatait tartalmazó fájlok automatikus olvasása céljából (mint például crawlerek) tilos.

7.4. Ha Ön lényegesen megszegi a jelen Szolgáltatási feltételeket, vagy más módon megszegi a törvényt a Szolgáltatásunk használatával összefüggésben, jogosultak lehetünk kártérítési igény érvényesítésére a vonatkozó jogszabályok szerint.

7.5. Ön bizalmasan kezeli a Szolgáltatáson keresztül vagy azzal kapcsolatban kapott e-maileket és egyéb üzeneteket, és nem adja át ezen üzeneteket harmadik félnek a feladó beleegyezése vagy komoly ok hiányában. Ugyanezek a szabályok vonatkoznak a többi tag nevére, telefon- és faxszámára, otthoni címére, e-mail-címére és/vagy URL-címére, illetve egyéb személyes adataira is.

7.6. Ön elfogadja, hogy a kapott üzeneteket (valamint a profiljában szereplő minden olyan információt, amelyet meg szeretne őrizni) rendszeres és megfelelő időközönként lekérdezi, és szükség esetén ezeket az információkat saját számítógépén vagy más adattároló rendszerében archiválja. Ön tudomásul veszi, hogy a fiókjában tárolt üzeneteket az üzenet beérkezésétől számított tizenkét hónap elteltével törölhetjük, anélkül, hogy külön értesítést küldenénk Önnek. Ha Ön Alapszintű tag, tudomásul veszi, hogy a jelenlegi Alapszintű tagságával kapcsolatos összes adatát automatikusan töröljük, ha a profilja huszonnégy hónapig inaktív.

7.7. Minden felhasználó köteles betartani a [Tartalomra és magatartásra vonatkozó szabályzatot](https://terms.hi5.com/content-and-conduct). Emellett tilos:

* megkísérelni jogosulatlanul hozzáférni az adatbázisunkhoz vagy más számítógépes rendszerekhez;
    
* az általunk a Szolgáltatással kapcsolatban használt bármely szoftverprogramot megváltoztatni, lefordítani, adaptálni, szerkeszteni, szétbontani vagy visszafejteni;
    
* bármilyen olyan tevékenységet folytatni, amely megzavarja, csökkenti a Szolgáltatás minőségét, zavarja a teljesítményét, vagy károsítja a Szolgáltatás működését;
    
* egy másik tag fiókját, felhasználónevét vagy jelszavát használni bármikor , vagy a jelszavát harmadik félnek felfedni, vagy harmadik félnek engedélyezni, hogy hozzáférjen a fiókjához;
    
* megkísérelni Virtuális termékek vásárlását a Szolgáltatáson kívül;
    
* megkísérelni Virtuális termékek értékesítését; és/vagy
    

7.8. megkísérelni az egyik Szolgáltatáshoz társított felhasználói fiók eladását. Ha Ön nem felel meg a jelen 7. pontban ismertetett magatartási előírásoknak, vagy ha Ön nem teljesíti az Előfizetési feltételek valamely lényeges kötelezettségét, akkor - amennyiben az adott eset körülményei alapján ésszerű - az alábbi intézkedéseket vagy azok mindegyikét megtehetjük: felszólíthatjuk Önt, hogy hagyjon fel a nem megfelelő tevékenységeivel (vagy más módon küldhetünk Önnek figyelmeztetést, hogy tevékenységei nem felelnek meg a magatartási előírásainknak); törölhetünk minden olyan tartalmat, amelyet Ön a Szolgáltatáson keresztül a magatartási előírásaink bármelyikét megszegve küldött be; felfüggeszthetjük a Szolgáltatás nyújtását az Ön számára (részben vagy egészben), amíg a probléma megoldódik (például amíg kivizsgáljuk az Ön tevékenységét); vagy (ha számunkra egyértelmű, hogy Ön komolyan visszaél a Szolgáltatással) megszüntethetjük a Szolgáltatás Ön számára történő nyújtását. Ha a Premium tagságot az Apple/Google-ön keresztül vásárolta, a visszatérítés az Apple/Google saját feltételei szerint kerül végrehajtásra a 2.4. pontban leírtak szerint.

**8\. Kommunikáció**

8.1. A felületünkön történő kommunikációnak mindig a jelen Szolgáltatási feltételekkel összhangban kell történnie, különösen a Szolgáltatás használatának biztonságra vonatkozó feltételekkel (lásd a 4. pontot) és a [Tartalmi és viselkedési szabályzattal](https://terms.hi5.com/content-and-conduct).

8.2. A Szolgáltatás online szolgáltatás. Ezért általában online kommunikálunk Önnel, például e-mailben vagy a mobilalkalmazásainkon és weboldalunkon található információs képernyőkön keresztül. Mivel digitális szolgáltatásról van szó, a Szolgáltatásunkat kizárólag online nyújtjuk. Ezért a Szolgáltatásunkra csak online regisztrálhat, online használhatja és online fizethet rá elő.

8.3. Annak érdekében, hogy ne kapjunk jogosulatlan megkereséseket (és hogy megvédjük fiókját a visszaélésektől), kérjük, adja meg a fiókjához kapcsolódó e-mail -címét vagy hasonló hitelesítő adatokat, hogy be tudjuk Önt azonosítani.

**9\. Felhasználási és szerzői jogok**

A Szolgáltatásunk használatával Ön tudomásul veszi és elfogadja, hogy mi vagyunk a Szolgáltatással kapcsolatos valamennyi jog kizárólagos tulajdonosai, beleértve a sokszorosítási, terjesztési és feldolgozási jogokat, minden szerzői jogot, valamint a Tagged és/vagy a Hi5 weboldal és a benne foglalt tartalom szellemi átadásának és sokszorosításának jogát.

Ön tudatában van annak, hogy a Tartalom nyilvánosan elérhetővé tétele révén azt más felhasználók is láthatják, és hogy más tagok visszaélhetnek vele, azaz a Tartalmát más célokra is felhasználhatják, mint amire Ön azt hozzáférhetővé tette. Ön biztosítja és garantálja, hogy Ön rendelkezik vagy birtokolja a szükséges licenceket, jogokat, hozzájárulásokat és engedélyeket az összes Tartalom közzétételéhez. Rendelkezünk olyan mechanizmusokkal, amelyekkel rendszeresen ellenőrizzük a jelen Szolgáltatási Feltételeknek és a vonatkozó jogszabályoknak való megfelelést, mindenekelőtt az Ön adataival való visszaélés megakadályozása érdekében, azonban nem tudjuk és nem is fogjuk teljes mértékben ellenőrizni a közzétett Tartalmat, és mint ilyen, nem ellenőrizzük annak pontosságát, épségét, minőségét vagy bármely más szempontot. Semmilyen körülmények között nem vállalunk felelősséget semmiféle Tartalomért, beleértve, de nem kizárólagosan a Tartalomban található hibákat vagy hiányosságokat, vagy bármilyen veszteségért vagy kárért, amely a Tartalom felhasználásából ered.

9.3. Ön ezennel felhatalmazza a Vállalatot arra, hogy az ilyen Tartalmakat (beleértve az Ön felhasználónevét és képmását) a Szolgáltatásokban felhasználja, terjessze, reprodukálja, rögzítse, módosítsa, adaptálja, feldolgozza, kombinálja, szinkronizálja, származékos műveket hozzon létre, közzétegye, nyilvánosan előadja és nyilvánosan megjelenítse, kizárólag azért, hogy az Ön számára a jelen Feltételeknek megfelelően Szolgáltatásainkat nyújthassuk.

9.4. Ez az engedély felhatalmazza a Vállalatot, hogy az Ön Tartalmát a világ többi része számára is elérhetővé tegye, és hogy mások is ugyanezt megtehessék. Ön tudomásul veszi, hogy ez az engedély tartalmazza a Vállalat azon jogát, hogy a Szolgáltatásokat nyújtsa, népszerűsítse, fejlessze, valamint hogy a Szolgáltatásokhoz vagy a Szolgáltatásokon keresztül benyújtott Tartalmat más vállalatok, szervezetek vagy magánszemélyek számára elérhetővé tegye az ilyen Tartalom más médiumokon és szolgáltatásokon történő közvetítése, sugárzása, terjesztése, népszerűsítése vagy közzététele céljából, a Vállalat ilyen tartalomhasználatra vonatkozó Szolgáltatási feltételeinek megfelelően. Az ilyen, a Vállalat, vagy más vállalatok, szervezetek vagy magánszemélyek általi felhasználás történhet anélkül, hogy az Ön által beküldött, közzétett, továbbított vagy más módon a Szolgáltatásokon keresztül elérhetővé tett Tartalmakért Önt kompenzáció illetné.

9.5. A Vállalat felhasználhatja az Ön visszajelzéseit, észrevételeit és javaslatait anélkül, hogy bármilyen kompenzációs kötelezettség terhelné. A Vállalat továbbra is használhatja és elérhetővé tehet bármilyen és minden Tartalmat, és a Vállalat a későbbiekben is rendelkezik ezekkel a jogokkal, még akkor is, ha az Ön fiókja megszűnik.

9.6. Ön tudomásul veszi és elfogadja, hogy a Vállalat nem ígéri meg a Szolgáltatásban elérhetővé tett Tartalom rendszeres ellenőrzését. Ön tudomásul veszi, hogy megtagadhatjuk az Ön által a Szolgáltatásban elérhetővé tett információ vagy Tartalom közzétételét, vagy eltávolíthatjuk azt, ha a Tartalom sérti a jelen Szolgáltatási feltételeket vagy bármely más alkalmazandó jogszabályt. Például eltávolíthatunk bármilyen olyan Tartalmat, amely sérti a jelen Szolgáltatási feltételeket, vagy más módon kifogásolható. Ön vállalja a Tartalom használatával kapcsolatos felelősséget, beleértve, de nem kizárólagosan az ilyen Tartalom pontosságára, teljességére vagy hasznosságára való támaszkodást. Ön nem sokszorosíthat, nem publikálhat, nem terjeszthet tovább, és nem mutathat be nyilvánosan olyan Tartalmat a Szolgáltatásokban, amely nem az Ön tulajdona.

**10\. Irányadó jog / Fogyasztóvédelmi jogviták bíróságon kívüli rendezése**

10.1. A jelen Szolgáltatási feltételekre az Egyesült Államok Kalifornia államának törvényei az irányadók, és azok szerint értelmezendők, tekintet nélkül a kollíziós jogi elvekre. Ez a jogválasztás azonban nem alkalmazható, ha ennek eredményeképpen megfosztja Önt attól a védelemtől, amelyet olyan rendelkezések nyújtanak Önnek, amelyektől megállapodással nem lehet eltérni azon jog alapján, amely a jogválasztás hiányában a törvényi rendelkezések alapján alkalmazandó lett volna.

10.2. A hatályos jogszabályok értelmében kötelesek vagyunk tájékoztatni a fogyasztókat az Európai Online Vitarendezési Platform létezéséről, amelyet az Európai Bizottság hozott létre vitarendezés céljából. Az Európai Online Vitarendezési Platform itt található: [https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/). A hivatalos vitarendezési testületek elérhetőségei a következő hivatkozáson találhatók: [https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/odr/main/index.cfm](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/odr/main/index.cfm). Jogszabályi kötelezettség hiányában nem vagyunk kötelesek részt venni vitarendezési eljárásban fogyasztói vitarendezési szerv előtt, és nem vagyunk kötelesek és nem kívánunk részt venni ilyen vitarendezési eljárásban. E-mail -címünk a 16. pontban található.

10.3. Ha a jelen Szolgáltatási feltételek bármely rendelkezése teljes egészében vagy részben érvénytelen vagy végrehajthatatlanná válik, az nem érinti jelen Szolgáltatási feltételek fennmaradó rendelkezéseinek érvényességét.

**11\. Lemondásra/elállásra vonatkozó szabályok, a felmondási jog gyakorlása**

11.1. A lemondás/elállás joga

Önnek joga van indoklás nélkül felmondani a szerződést attól a dátumtól számított 14 napon belül, amikor e-mailben megküldtük Önnek a visszaigazolást a vásárlásról.

A lemondáshoz való jogának gyakorlásához Önnek értesítenie kell minket az alábbiakban megadott elérhetőségek bármelyikén:

postai úton: The Meet Group, Inc., 100 Union Square Drive, New Hope, PA 18938, USA

e-mailben: [support@themeetgroup.com](mailto:support@themeetgroup.com)

Egyértelmű írásbeli nyilatkozatot kell adnia nekünk a vásárlás lemondásáról szóló döntéséről. Használhatja az alább elérhető lemondási űrlapot , ez azonban nem kötelező. Ha nem szeretné ezt az űrlapot használni, kérjük, győződjön meg arról, hogy a 11.3. pontban felsorolt információkat átadja részünkre.

11.2. A lemondás hatása

Ha Ön a 14 napos felmondási időn belül felmondja a szerződését, visszautaljuk az Öntől érkezett összes befizetést indokolatlan késedelem nélkül, de minden esetben legkésőbb attól a naptól számított 14 napon belül, amikor bennünket értesített a felmondásra vonatkozó döntéséről. A visszatérítést ugyanazzal a fizetési móddal hajtjuk végre, mint amelyet az eredeti tranzakció során használt, kivéve, ha Ön kifejezetten másképp nem rendelkezik; az ilyen visszatérítés során semmilyen esetben sem merül fel az Ön számára semmilyen díj.

Mindazonáltal kérjük, vegye figyelembe, hogy ha a 14 napos elállási időszakon belül megkezdte a megvásárolt áru vagy szolgáltatás használatát, akkor jogosultak leszünk a visszatérített összegből egy észszerű összeget visszatartani (értékkompenzáció) az áru vagy szolgáltatás azon részéért, amelyet Ön már igénybe vett.

11.3. Ügyeljen arra, hogy megadja a fiókjához kapcsolódó e-mail-címet vagy hasonló hitelesítő adatokat.

11.4. A 11.1-11.3. pontok nem vonatkoznak az Apple-től az iOS alkalmazáson keresztül vagy a Google-tól az Android alkalmazáson keresztül vásárolt Premium tagság törlésére. További információkért lásd a 2.4. pontot. Az Apple/ Google további mechanizmusokat is biztosíthat az előfizetés törlésére. Az Apple-nél az iOS alkalmazáson keresztül vagy a Google-nél az Android alkalmazáson keresztül vásárolt Premium tagság megszüntetéséhez lásd a lemondásra vonatkozó utasításokat az Apple esetében [itt](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202039) és a Google esetében [**itt**](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481).

**12\. Az Ön törvényes jogai**

Önnek joga van ahhoz, hogy a Szolgáltatás a leírásnak megfelelő, a célnak megfelelő és megbízható minőségben álljon rendelkezésre. Ha Premium tagságot vásárol, és az általunk biztosított tartalom hibás, Ön javításra vagy cserére jogosult; vagy ha a hiba nem javítható, vagy nem javítható észszerű időn belül és jelentős kényelmetlenség nélkül, akkor teljes vagy részleges visszatérítésre lehet jogosult. Ha be tudja bizonyítani, hogy a hiba kárt okozott a készülékében, és mi nem az elvárható gondossággal és szakértelemmel jártunk el, javításra vagy kártérítésre lehet jogosult.

**13\. Vegyes rendelkezések**

13.1. Harmadik fél szolgáltatókat és ügynököket vehetünk igénybe, beleértve a csoportunkhoz tartozó szervezeteket is, hogy segítségünkre legyenek a Szolgáltatás nyújtásában.

13.2. Amennyiben az Előfizetés feltételeinek bármely rendelkezése érvénytelen vagy érvénytelenné válik, illetve hiányos, az nem érinti az Előfizetési feltételek fennmaradó tartalmának érvényességét.

13.3. A szerződés nyelve és az Előfizetési feltételek nyelve az angol.

13.4. Az Ön előfizetési feltételeinek a másolatát nem őrizzük meg automatikusan. Éppen ezért mentse el a szerződés egy példányát a számítógépére, vagy más módon tároljon el egy példányt az Előfizetési feltételekből a szerződés megkötésének időpontjában.

13.5. Ön nem ruházhatja át vagy adhatja tovább az Előfizetési feltételekben foglalt jogait vagy kötelezettségeit harmadik félnek, kivéve, ha abba írásban beleegyezünk.

13.6. Az Előfizetési feltételek szerinti jogainkat vagy kötelezettségeinket engedményezhetjük, átruházhatjuk vagy alvállalkozásba adhatjuk belátásunk szerint bármely harmadik félnek. Ha azonban harmadik felet bíztunk meg az Önnel kötött szerződés teljesítésével, továbbra is felelősséggel tartozunk Önnel szemben a szerződésünk teljes körű teljesítéséért, valamint a harmadik fél általi teljesítéséért.

13.7. A leányvállalataink és a csoport vállalatai a jelen Szolgáltatási feltételek harmadik fél kedvezményezettjei. Ön, a TMG és más leányvállalataink és a csoport vállalatai az 1999. évi szerződésekről („Harmadik felek jogai”) szóló törvénynek megfelelően érvényesíthetik a jelen Előfizetési feltételeket. Ettől eltekintve, (de az alábbi 14. és 15. pontra is figyelemmel) az 1999. évi szerződésekről szóló („Harmadik felek jogai”) törvény értelmében senki másnak nincs joga az Előfizetési feltételek érvényesítésére.

**16\. Pets Szolgáltatási feltételek**

16.1. Tagként Önnek lehetősége van részt venni a Pets játékban, amely a Szolgáltatásaink olyan funkciója, amely lehetővé teszi, hogy „vásároljon”, „eladjon” és „kereskedjen” virtuális „Pets” háziállatokkal, és közben új személyekkel ismerkedjen meg. Versenyezhet más tagokkal, hogy kiderítse, hogy ki gyűjti össze a legtöbb Pets háziállatot, és kinek a profilja a „legértékesebb”.

16.2. A Pets funkcióhoz történő hozzáféréssel és a jelen feltételek elfogadásával Ön tudomásul veszi és elfogadja, hogy részt vesz a Szolgáltatás részét képező Pets játékban. Ön tudomásul veszi és elfogadja, hogy a Pets játék lehetővé teszi más tagok számára, hogy hozzáférjenek az Ön profilleírásaihoz és képmásaihoz, és ezek a tagok különféleképpen felhasználhatják ezeket a leírásokat és képmásokat. Ez a használat magában foglalhatja az Ön és más tagok „pets” háziállatként történő megjelölését, amelyeket a tagok „birtokolhatnak”, és az ilyen „pets” háziállatok „eladását” (virtuális termékekért cserébe) más tagoknak. Az egyes háziállatokhoz társított „értéket” az általunk meghatározott kritériumok alapján jelölhetünk meg, amely magában foglalhatja az adott háziállatot érintő „eladások” számát és gyakoriságát. Az egyes pet háziállatokhoz rendelt érték idővel változhat. A vállalat olyan rangsorokat és egyéb adatokat tehet közzé, amelyek a tagok tulajdonában lévő háziállatok értékére vonatkozó hivatkozásokat vagy számításokat tartalmaznak. Azzal, hogy taggá válik, Ön visszavonhatatlanul engedélyt, jóváhagyást, felhatalmazást és licencet ad nekünk és kapcsolt vállalkozásainknak, jogutódainknak és megbízottjainknak, hogy használjuk és engedélyezzük másoknak, beleértve más tagokat is, hogy az Ön képét, képmását, megjelenését, profilinformációit, vagy más személyes jellemzőit a Pets játék vagy a Szolgáltatás egyéb műveleteivel kapcsolatban örökre, az Ön további hozzájárulása nélkül, és jogdíj, kifizetés vagy más kompenzáció nélkül felhasználják.

TÁJÉKOZTATÁS AZ ELÁLLÁSI JOGRÓL
-------------------------------

### ELÁLLÁSI JOG

Önnek jogában áll tizennégy napon belül, indoklás nélkül elállni a szerződéstől.

Az elállás időtartama a szerződéskötéstől számított tizennégy nap.

Az elállási joga gyakorlásához értesítenie kell minket (The Meet Group, Inc., 100 Union Square Drive, New Hope, PA 18938, USA, [support@themeetgroup.com](mailto:support@themeetgroup.com)) egy egyértelmű nyilatkozat útján (pl. postai úton vagy e-mailben küldött levélben) arról, hogy el kíván állni a szerződéstől. Ehhez használhatja a csatolt elállási formanyomtatványt, de ez nem kötelező.

Az elállási határidő betartásához elég, ha az elállási jog gyakorlásáról szóló értesítést az elállási határidő lejárta előtt elküldi.

### AZ ELÁLLÁS KÖVETKEZMÉNYEI

Ha Ön eláll a szerződéstől, akkor az Öntől beérkezett minden befizetést, beleértve a szállítási költségeket is (kivéve az abból eredő további költségeket, hogy Ön az általunk felajánlott legolcsóbb standard szállítási módtól eltérő szállítási módot választott), késedelem nélkül, de legkésőbb attól a naptól számított tizennégy napon belül, amikor a szerződéstől történő elállásáról szóló értesítést megkaptuk, visszatérítjük Önnek. A visszafizetéshez ugyanazt a fizetési módot alkalmazzuk, amelyet Ön az eredeti tranzakció során használt, kivéve, ha Önnel kifejezetten másképp állapodtunk meg; a visszafizetés semmilyen esetben sem kerül kiszámlázásra.

Oferim serviciul nostru la nivel global; și este posibil ca membrii noștri să caute și să contacteze alți membri în oricare din țările în care activăm.

**2\. Accesul la serviciu și încheierea abonamentului**

2.1. Pentru a accesa și utiliza serviciul va trebui să vă înregistrați. Pentru a face acest lucru, va trebui să alegeți o opțiune de înregistrare disponibilă, cum ar fi e-mail, SMS, conectarea cu Apple, conectarea cu Google sau Facebook și să furnizați acreditările de conectare, cum ar fi adresa de e-mail și o parolă la alegere. Aveți responsabilitatea de a păstra confidențialitatea parolei și a acreditărilor contului. În plus, răspundeți pentru activitățile cauzate din culpă care au loc în contul dvs. Sunteți de acord să ne informați imediat cu privire la orice utilizare neautorizată a contului dvs. sau orice altă încălcare a securității odată ce aflați despre aceasta.

2.2. După ce v-ați înregistrat cu succes, veți putea accesa serviciul nostru gratuit („abonament de bază”).

2.3. De asemenea, oferim diverse servicii sau funcții care sunt supuse unei taxe. Înainte de a vă înscrie pentru a achiziționa astfel de servicii sau funcții, vă vom furniza informații suplimentare despre ceea ce veți cumpăra, de exemplu, dacă este cazul: principalele caracteristici ale serviciilor sau funcțiilor, termenul abonamentului (inclusiv orice prelungire), cum să vă reziliați abonamentul, prețul și orice condiții de plată și limitările mijloacelor de plată. În cazul în care achiziționați bunuri virtuale (vedeți clauza 3.3 de mai jos), vă vom informa suplimentar că acestea pot fi valorificate numai prin intermediul serviciului pentru mărfuri și conținut digital și că nu sunt rambursabile. Dacă doriți să vă actualizați abonamentul de bază alegând un abonament care face obiectul unei taxe („abonament Premium”) sau să accesați orice alte servicii sau funcții supuse unei taxe, confirmați faptul că prin apăsarea butonului „Cumpărați acum” (sau un buton comparabil), veți fi confirmat că doriți să achiziționați abonamentul Premium sau alte servicii sau funcții pe care le-ați selectat. Relația noastră contractuală pentru astfel de achiziții va fi confirmată la data la care veți primi o confirmare a comenzii dvs. Rețineți, totuși, că îndeplinirea obligației dvs. de plată față de noi este condiționată de verificarea și procesarea achiziției de către furnizorul de servicii de plată respectiv.

De regulă, o achiziție printr-un magazin de aplicații va avea loc atunci când faceți clic pe „Cumpărați acum” (sau pe un buton comparabil) și, atunci când este necesar, introduceți parola sau acreditări echivalente (de exemplu, Touch ID sau Face ID). ) pentru magazinul de aplicații.

3.3. Puteți achiziționa „bunuri virtuale” pentru utilizare exclusiv în cadrul serviciului (cum ar fi „aur” virtual).

În plus, deși oferim o descriere a serviciului nostru pe site-ul nostru web, este posibil să modificăm principalele caracteristici ale serviciului nostru din când în când, fără costuri suplimentare pentru dvs. Cu toate acestea, dacă facem acest lucru, vă vom anunța cu privire la aceasta într-o perioadă rezonabilă de timp înainte de intrarea în vigoare a acestei modificări și ne puteți contacta apoi pentru a rezilia abonamentul în termen de 30 de zile de la informarea cu privire la astfel de modificări în cazul în care modificările vă afectează capacitatea de a accesa serviciile sau capacitatea de a utiliza serviciile și dacă o astfel de afectare nu este doar nesemnificativă înainte ca modificările să intre în vigoare (și, în cazul în care v-ați abonat la un abonament Premium prin intermediul nostru, veți primi o rambursare de la noi pentru partea din serviciu pentru care ați plătit, dar de care nu ați beneficiat din cauza rezilierii timpurii a abonamentului). Orice astfel de notificare vă va informa cu privire la natura și motivele unei astfel de modificări, momentul la care modificarea va intra în vigoare și dreptul dvs. de a rezilia abonamentul în termen de 30 de zile de la asemenea notificare în conformitate cu această clauză 3.6.
