### Introduction

RealtimeBoard, Inc. dba Miro (“**Miro**” and also referred to as “**our**”, “**us**” and “**we**”) understands the importance of user privacy and takes privacy matters very seriously. By visiting Miro’s existing and future website(s), application(s) and/or domain name(s) at https://miro.com, including its sub-domains and mobile optimized version (collectively, the “**Site**”), or otherwise accessing any linked pages, features, content, products, services, mobile properties and mobile device applications for iPhone, iPad, Android or other smartphone or tablet device (each, a "**Service**") owned or operated by Miro, you acknowledge that you have read and understand the terms in this Privacy Policy (“**Policy**”). Please note that this Policy applies where we are processing personal information on our own behalf. If you have been given access to our Services by another company or organization (e.g., your employer), or are otherwise using our Services on behalf of another company or organization, then we may be processing your information on behalf of that company or organization. In those circumstances, your access and use of the Services is subject to the agreement we have entered with that company or organization (the “**Customer Agreement**”) and the organization that entered into the Customer Agreement (“**Customer**”) controls and is responsible for the processing of your information. This Policy does not apply to information that we process on behalf of our Customers and if you have any questions about specific settings and privacy practices, please contact the administrator for your Miro account. In addition, this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party applications or software that integrate with the Services (“**Third Party Services**”), or any other third party products, services or businesses. This Privacy Policy describes the following information about collected by Miro:

### Information We Collect

We collect a variety of personally identifiable information ("PII") about users of our Services in order to ensure a quality user experience. "PII" means information that we can use to identify or contact you, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address or other contact information. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of all PII that you submit to us. Inaccurate information may affect your experience when using the Services and/or our ability to contact you as described in this Policy. PII collected by us is protected as personal data under applicable data protection law. PII does not include "Aggregated Information" which is information or data we collect where individual user identities have been removed, including metadata on your use of the Services, IP address logs, device and location information. Aggregated Information helps us understand trends, user needs and other information to provide improved Services and may be used by us for any purpose. We may also collect other non-personally identifiable information about your use and interaction with our Services. "Non-personally identifiable information" means information where we cannot determine the identity of a natural person. Non-personally identifiable information is not treated as PII unless we combine it with or link it to PII that you give to us. If you do not wish to disclose any required information, then your sole remedies shall be to close this web tab, delete your Miro account and/or exit the Site.

### How We Collect Information

#### Information You Give Us

We collect information that you give to us when you register or use our Services. When you register for a Miro user account ("**Account**") on the website or mobile application, you will be assigned a unique account identifier which will be associated with any information you give to us under your Account. You may also give us information to allow us to contact you or use certain features available through our Services without signing up for an Account, such as when you fill out a request form, provide feedback, email us, or engage in communications with our team. While you may use some functionality of the Services and/or Site without registering for an Account, most functionality and services will require that you register for an Account.

#### Customer Support Information

Your emails, calls and other correspondence to and from us may be recorded for various purposes including: monitoring customer service quality or compliance, checking accuracy of the information you provide us, preventing fraud or providing training for our staff or customer service representatives. Any information obtained from you through Customer support will be treated in accordance with the provisions of this Policy.

#### Information We Collect Automatically

Even if you do not provide information to us, we automatically collect certain information about your use and interaction with our Site and/or Services. For example, when you visit our website, our systems automatically maintain web logs to record data about all visitors who use our website and stores this information in our database. These web logs may contain information about you including the following: IP address, type(s) of operating system you use, type of device you use, date and time you visited the website, your activity and/or referring websites. We use your log information to troubleshoot problems, gather demographic information, customize your experience when accessing our Site, Services and other business purposes.

#### Information Collected From Other Sources

We may receive information about you from outside sources, such as commercially available demographic or marketing information, and add or combine it with your information to provide better service to you and inform you of Services or other information that may be of interest to you. Our Site offers you the functionality of using your social media credentials (e.g. Facebook, Google, Miro, etc.) to use single-sign-on to enter our Site, and in that manner, we may also collect certain information from you as you log on. We will not collect more information from you when using your social media credentials beyond the information such third parties disclose to us.

### How We Use Information

• Improve your user experience and provide you with customer support.

• Investigate and help prevent security issues, abuse and breaches.

• As required by applicable law, legal process or regulation.

### With Whom We Share Information

#### Disclosure With Your Consent

Where we are processing your information on behalf of a Customer, the Customer determines their own policies and practices for the sharing and disclosure of your information and Miro does not control how a Customer or any other third parties choose to share or disclose information. Where we are processing your information on our own behalf, we may disclose your information with your consent, which we may obtain in a number of ways, including:

• In writing;

• Verbally;

• Online, by clicking on a link or button;

• Other mechanism.

Our Services permit you to submit information which may be displayed to other authorized users in the same or different Customer Account. The sharing and other controls applied to such information may be determined by you, other users and/or an administrator of your Account.

#### Disclosure Without Your Consent

In general, we may disclose your information without your consent to disclosure when we reasonably believe disclosure is appropriate in order to:

• Comply with the law (e.g., lawful subpoena or court order);

• Cooperate with or report to law enforcement agencies in investigations that involve users who use our Service Offerings for activities that are or seem illegal or illegitimate activities;

• Enforce or apply agreements for our Service Offerings; or

• Protect our rights or property or that of our affiliates, including respective officers, directors, employees, agents, third party content providers, suppliers, sponsors, or licensors (e.g., to address allegations about fraudulent or unlawful activity related to a Miro account).

When a third party acts solely on our behalf and otherwise as applicable, we use reasonable commercial efforts to require that party to follow the privacy practices stated in this Policy or have complementary privacy protections to protect your information. We do not share your information with unaffiliated third parties except as permitted to do so in this Policy.

### How We Protect Information

We use industry standard protocols and technology to protect your registered user information and personal data in order to guard and encrypt data for transmission in a format that prevents data theft by unauthorized third parties, including internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices, security measures, and physical security measures. However, please take into account that the Internet and email transmissions are not secure or error free communication means. We also urge you to take additional steps on your own to safeguard and maintain the integrity of your information. For example, you should never share your Account or login information with other people and be sure to sign off when finished using a shared or public computer. We urge you to be aware that if you use or access our Services through a third party computer network (e.g., internet café, library) or other potentially non-secure internet connection, such use is not recommended and is solely at your own risk. It is your responsibility to check beforehand on the privacy and/or security policy of your network prior to accessing the Services. We are not responsible for your handling, sharing, re-sharing and/or distribution of your information except as set forth in the Policy.

This includes transferring your information to a country that the European Commission or UK authorities (as applicable) have determined provides an adequate level of protection for personal information, or by implementing standard contractual clauses with our customers, third party service providers and partners. We have also implemented certain additional safeguards to ensure your information remains protected, such as encrypting and pseudonymising information (where possible) and implementing strict security and access controls.

#### Privacy Shield

Miro complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and United Kingdom, as applicable, to the United States. Miro has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/. Miro remains liable if it fails to meet its obligations under the Privacy Shield and is responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. In addition, when Miro receives personal information subject to the Privacy Shield Principles and subsequently transfers such information to a third-party service provider acting as an agent on Miro’s behalf, Miro remains liable if the agent processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield and we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Miro commits to resolve complaints about our collection and use of your personal information. Individuals in the European Union and United Kingdom with inquiries or complaints regarding our processing of personal information under the Privacy Shield should first contact our Data Protection Officer by sending an email to privacy@miro.com. We will respond to your complaint within 45 days of receipt. Miro has further committed to cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) as our independent recourse mechanism with regard to unresolved Privacy Shield complaints. If you are unsatisfied with the response you have received from us, or your complaint remains unresolved, you can contact your local DPA and they will investigate your complaint free of charge. You may also refer your complaint to the U.S. Department of Commerce or FTC for further investigation. In certain circumstances, you may elect to arbitrate unresolved complaints pursuant to the Privacy Shield’s Recourse, Enforcement and Liability Principle. Each party shall be responsible for its own attorney’s fees. Pursuant to the Privacy Shield, the arbitrator(s) may only impose individual-specific, non-monetary, equitable relief necessary to remedy any violation of the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to the individual filing the complaint. Miro is also subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. Please note that Miro does not rely on the Privacy Shield as a mechanism to transfer personal information to the USA under the General Data Protection Regulation or UK data protection laws.

#### Legal basis to process your information
