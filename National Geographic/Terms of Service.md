**1\. Description of National Geographic Partners, LLC Services and Acceptance of Terms of Use**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

National Geographic Partners, LLC, (“National Geographic Partners,” or “we” or “us”) a joint venture of the National Geographic Society and the subsidiaries of The Walt Disney Company, has developed this Terms of Use Agreement (“Agreement”) to describe the terms that govern your access and use of the Services (defined below). This Agreement applies to the National Geographic Partners websites (“NG Sites”), mobile sites, applications ("apps"), widgets, NG Products (as defined below) and other content and services that are linked to this Agreement (collectively, the "Services"). National Geographic Partners is based in the United States.

Your access to and use of certain Services may require you to accept additional terms and conditions applicable to such Services, including any future modifications (collectively, "Additional Terms") in addition to this Agreement, and may require you to download software or Content (as defined below). The Additional Terms are made a part of this Agreement by this reference. In the event of a conflict, between any such Additional Terms and this Agreement, such Additional Terms will prevail over this Agreement with respect to your use of that specific Service.

Except as to those NG Sites and apps directed to children, including [kids.nationalgeographic.com](https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/), [natgeolittlekids.com](https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/littlekids/), and certain online features directed to children, all other content, products and Services are limited to users aged 13 years and above, except in European Economic Area (“EEA”), where the Services are limited to users aged 16 years and above.

PLEASE NOTE THAT THE “ARBITRATION AGREEMENT” SECTION BELOW CONTAINS PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE (i) WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, ALL DISPUTES ARISING BETWEEN YOU AND NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC PARTNERS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT TO BE RESOLVED IN BINDING ARBITRATION, AND NOT IN COURT, AND (ii) YOU AND NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC PARTNERS WAIVE THE RIGHT TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH DISPUTES. PLEASE [CLICK HERE](#arbitration) TO REVIEW THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. BY USING THE NG SITES AND ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY.

National Geographic Partners furnishes the Services (as defined below) for your personal enjoyment and entertainment. By using any Service (whether or not you have an account or subscription) or by clicking a box that states that you accept and agree to this Agreement, you signify your agreement to be bound by this Agreement, including any future modifications, and any Additional Terms and to abide by all applicable laws, rules and regulations ("Applicable Law"). Please read through this Agreement carefully. **If you do not agree to be bound by this Agreement and to abide by all Applicable Law, you may not use the Services and must discontinue use of the Services immediately.** National Geographic Partners may modify this Agreement at any time, and each such modification will be effective upon posting on or to the Service. All material modifications will apply prospectively only. Your continued use of the Services following any modification constitutes your acceptance of and agreement to be bound by this Agreement as so modified. It is therefore important that you review this Agreement regularly. National Geographic Partners may also use third-party service providers, such as vendors, contractors, agents or sponsors, to operate, develop or help National Geographic Partners manage and provide the Services.

**2\. National Geographic Partners Account Registration and Security**
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Some Services require you to create an account (including setting up a National Geographic Partners credential and password) to participate in or to secure additional Services, such as viewing and commenting on NG Content (defined below), purchasing NG Products, creating an NG Site profile and signing up for specific National Geographic Partners newsletters. To create an account and interact with participating Services click on the Sign In/Join link on the Service webpage and create a profile.

All registration information you submit directly to us or through a Third-Party Service (defined below) to create an account must be accurate and must be kept updated by you by visiting our customer portal [here](https://membercenter.nationalgeographic.com/). Your failure to do so will constitute a breach of the Agreement, which may result in immediate termination of your account. You may not (i) select or use as a username a name of another person with the intent to impersonate that person; or (ii) use as a username a name subject to any rights of another person without appropriate authorization. National Geographic Partners reserves the right to refuse registration of, or cancel, a username, in its sole discretion. It is your responsibility to notify us of any changes in such information, including, but not limited to your contact information. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of all your passwords and are responsible for all use of your account. It is therefore critical that you do not share your account information with anyone. You may be held liable for losses incurred by National Geographic Partners, the National Geographic Society, NG Affiliates (defined below) or any other National Geographic Partners user or visitor in the event someone else uses your account as a result of your failure to keep your account information secure and confidential and you agree to indemnify National Geographic Partners, the National Geographic Society and all NG Affiliates from any third-party claims arising from such actions. You agree not to use the account, username, email address or password of another member or subscriber at any time and not to allow any other person to use your account. You agree to notify National Geographic Partners immediately if you suspect any unauthorized use of, or access to, your account or password. National Geographic Partners shall retain the right to change your username, but no obligation, for any reason, including, without limitation, if the username you have selected violates this Agreement. If National Geographic Partners makes available a manner by which you are able to upload a picture to your profile, National Geographic Partners shall also retain the right, but no obligation, to review any profile pictures provided by you.

National Geographic Partners will provide you with advance notice of any such fees, including any change in the amount of such fees, and a way to cancel your account and/or subscription in the event you do not wish to pay the modified fee. If you continue to use the Services after the applicable fee has been imposed or increased, you are expressly agreeing to the subscription fee or increase thereto and you will be responsible for paying such fee for the balance of your subscription service. You will not be entitled to a refund of any unused portion of such fees or other payments if National Geographic Partners suspends or terminates your account, and/or access to any Service (or any portion of the Services), due to your breach of this Agreement or violation of Applicable Law, as determined by National Geographic Partners, in its sole discretion.

**6\. Purchasing NG Products**
------------------------------

In connection with a purchase of any Services feature, subscription (including any premium subscription) or product, through any Service ("NG Product") you may be required to provide personal information, including credit card and billing information (“Personal Financial Information”), to an independent third-party selected by, but not affiliated with, National Geographic Partners (the “Processor”). Where the Processor is responsible for collecting, transmitting and/or processing your Personal Financial Information and, in some instances, for fulfilling your order, the collection, use and transmission of your Personal Financial Information and any payment obligations for NG Products shall be governed by the terms of use/service and privacy policy(ies) of the Processor. If you make a purchase of an NG Product, you are warranting that you are authorized to make the purchase using the Personal Financial Information that you provide to the Processor. **You must be 18 years of age or older to purchase an NG Product**.

If you purchase certain subscription based NG Products, your subscription will be automatically renewed and the credit or debit card you provided to the Processor for such NG Product will be charged per the billing cycle of your subscription (e.g., monthly, 3-month, 6-month, annual), unless you cancel the subscription prior to the automatic renewal date of the subscription. The renewal charge for your subscription shall be the same as the original purchase price, unless you are otherwise notified in advance. You acknowledge and agree that the authorization to charge your credit card for the subscription shall automatically transfer to any successors or assigns of National Geographic Partners or the Processor, for a substantially similar subscription. Some subscription options include a free trial period. You are allowed only one free trial period. Subsequent subscriptions or upgrades do not qualify for additional free trials.

National Geographic Partners makes no warranty, and to the fullest extent provided by law, accepts no liability for any loss or damages whatsoever, relating to, or in connection with, your placement of an order for an NG Product with the Processor. National Geographic Partners provides no refunds for, makes no warranty for, and to the fullest extent provided by law, accepts no liability, regarding purchases you make on or through any Service. You are solely responsible for any and all transactions utilizing your Personal Financial Information, including, but not limited to, any and all charges. You acknowledge and agree that in the event the Processor experiences a data breach that affects any of your information, National Geographic Partners will in no way be responsible or liable to you for any such data breach.

If you have any questions regarding your purchases or transactions or believe that there is an error or unauthorized transaction or activity associated with transactions utilizing your information, you must contact the Processor.

21\. Arbitration Agreement
--------------------------

(1) National Geographic Partners, including our NG Affiliates, the National Geographic Society, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, and you agree that any Dispute (as defined herein) between you and National Geographic Partners, regarding any aspect of your relationship with National Geographic Partners, will be resolved in a binding, confidential, individual and fair arbitration process, and not in court. Each of you and National Geographic Partners agrees to give up the right to sue in court. The term “Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced, and shall include any dispute, claim, demand, count, cause of action, or controversy between you and National Geographic Partners, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, or any other intentional tort), or any other legal or equitable theory. The term “Dispute” specifically includes, but is not limited to, any and all claims between you and National Geographic Partners in any way related to or concerning this Arbitration Agreement, any other aspect of these Terms of Use (including their applicability and their conformance to applicable law), any products or services provided by National Geographic Partners, any billing disputes, and any disputes relating to telephonic, text message, or any other communications either of us received from the other. The only exceptions to this Arbitration Agreement are that (i) each of you and National Geographic Partners retains the right to sue in small claims court and (ii) each of you and National Geographic Partners may bring suit in court against the other to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. Disputes over whether these exceptions apply shall be resolved by the court in which such action has been brought; all other disputes over arbitrability shall be resolved by the arbitrator. Each of you and National Geographic Partners also agrees to give up the ability to seek to represent, in a class action or otherwise, anyone but each of you and National Geographic Partners (see paragraph 9 of this Arbitration Agreement below). There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. An arbitrator must follow this Arbitration Agreement. The arbitrator, however, can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief, or statutory damages).

(2) This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement.

(3) Any arbitration between you and National Geographic Partners will be conducted by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”), pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures effective July 1, 2014 (the “JAMS Rules”), as modified by this agreement to arbitrate. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator, and if you and National Geographic Partners cannot agree on who that single arbitrator will be, the arbitrator will be appointed pursuant to the JAMS Rules, with the participation and involvement of National Geographic Partners and you pursuant to JAMS Rule 12. The JAMS Rules are available on its website [here](http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/). The Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards are available [here](http://www.jamsadr.com/consumer-minimum-standards/). The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Arbitration Agreement.

(4) If either you or National Geographic Partners wants to arbitrate a Dispute, you or National Geographic Partners must first send by mail to the other a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving notice, the specific facts giving rise to the Dispute, the NG Service to which the Notice relates, and the relief requested. Your Notice to the National Geographic Partners must be sent by mail to Arbitration Notice of Dispute, c/o Business and Legal Affairs, Litigation VP, 1145 17th Street NW, Washington, DC 20036. The National Geographic Partners will send any Notice to you at the contact information we have for you or that you provide. It is the sender’s responsibility to ensure that the recipient receives the Notice. During the first 45 days after you or we send a Notice to the other, you and we may try to reach a settlement of the Dispute.

If you and we do not resolve the Dispute within those first 45 days, either you or we may initiate arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Rules. Further instructions on submitting a Demand for Arbitration may be found [here](http://www.jamsadr.com/files/Uploads/Documents/JAMS_Arbitration_Demand.pdf). In addition to filing this Demand for Arbitration with JAMS in accordance with its rules and procedures, you must send a copy of this completed Demand for Arbitration to the National Geographic Partners at the address listed above to which you sent your Notice of Dispute.

(5) You and the National Geographic Partners acknowledge and agree to abide by the following rules for arbitration: (a) YOU AND NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC PARTNERS MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR MULTI-CLAIMANT PROCEEDING, AND THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE NO POWER TO AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF; (b) the National Geographic Partners will pay arbitration costs as required by the JAMS Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards and consistent with paragraph 6 below; (c) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law; and (d) each side pays his, her or its own attorneys' fees, except as otherwise provided in paragraph 8 below.

(6) JAMS charges filing and other fees to conduct arbitrations. Ordinarily, the claimant has to pay the filing fee to initiate arbitration, but if you wish to commence an arbitration against National Geographic Partners, you and the National Geographic Partners acknowledge and agree to abide by the following:

*   If you are seeking to recover less than $10,000 (inclusive of attorneys’ fees), National Geographic Partners will pay the filing fee on your behalf or reimburse your payment of it.
*   If you are seeking to recover $10,000 or more, you will have to pay the filing fee charged by JAMS, but National Geographic Partners will reimburse the filing fee if you prevail on all claims decided upon by the arbitrator.
*   National Geographic Partners and you agree that, if the claims to be arbitrated total less than $10,000 (inclusive of attorneys’ fees), the claim ordinarily should be decided on written submissions only, without a telephonic or in-person hearing. National Geographic Partners will not request a hearing for any claims totaling less than $10,000. This provision shall not be construed by the arbitrator to deprive you of any rights you may have to a telephonic or in-person hearing in your hometown area pursuant to the JAMS Rules.
*   National Geographic Partners and you agree that, if the claims to be arbitrated total $10,000 or more, the arbitration will occur in a manner and place consistent with the JAMS Rules.

(7) Regardless of how the arbitration proceeds, each of you and National Geographic Partners shall cooperate in good faith in the exchange of non-privileged documents and information as necessary in accordance with the JAMS Rules, and the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain his or her findings and conclusions.

(8) Each of you and National Geographic Partners may incur attorneys’ fees during the arbitration. Each side agrees to pay his, her or its own attorneys’ fees unless the claim(s) at issue permit the prevailing party to be paid its attorneys' fees, and in such instance, the fees awarded shall be determined by the applicable law(s). In addition to whatever rights you may have to recover your attorneys’ fees under applicable law, if you prevail in the arbitration, and if National Geographic Partners failed to make a settlement offer to you before the arbitration or the amount you win is at least 25% greater than National Geographic Partners' highest settlement offer, then National Geographic Partners will pay your reasonable attorneys’ fees in addition to the amount the arbitrator awarded. If National Geographic Partners wins the arbitration, you will be responsible for your own attorneys’ fees. In addition, if the arbitrator, at the request of the winning party, finds that the losing party brought a claim or asserted a defense frivolously or for an improper purpose, then regardless of the amount in dispute, the arbitrator must order the losing party to pay both sides’ arbitration fees and may order the losing party to pay the winning party’s reasonable attorneys’ fees, unless such an award of fees is prohibited by applicable law.

(9) The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. The arbitrator may not order National Geographic Partners to pay any monies to or take any actions with respect to persons other than you, unless National Geographic Partners explicitly consents in advance, after an arbitrator is selected, to permit the arbitrator to enter such an order. Further, unless National Geographic Partners expressly agrees, the arbitrator may not consolidate other persons’ claims with yours, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, multi-claimant or class proceeding.

(10) You and National Geographic Partners agree to maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and shall not disclose the fact of the arbitration, any documents exchanged as part of any mediation, proceedings of the arbitration, the arbitrator’s decision and the existence or amount of any award, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration (in which case anyone becoming privy to confidential information must undertake to preserve its confidentiality), or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a provisional remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or court order.

(11) With the exception of subpart (a) in paragraph (5) (i.e., the waiver of the ability to proceed on behalf of multiple claimants or a purported class), if any part of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the balance of this Arbitration Agreement shall remain in effect and be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, or illegal provision were not contained. If, however, subpart (a) in paragraph (5) is found invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, but the rest of this Agreement, including the provisions governing where actions against National Geographic Partners must be pursued, the choice of governing law, and our mutual waiver of the right to a trial by jury, will remain in effect and apply to any claim that, for this or any other reason, proceeds in court rather than in arbitration.

**22\. Governing Law**
----------------------

This Agreement will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Except with respect to Disputes to be resolved through an arbitration process in accordance with the Arbitration Agreement contained above, you and National Geographic Partners agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in New York, New York to resolve any Dispute arising out of this Agreement or the Services. YOU HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY CLAIMS, COUNTERCLAIMS, CROSS-CLAIMS, OR THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS) ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT.
