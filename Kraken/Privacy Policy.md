In addition, the processing of personal data takes place to enable the completion of our client on-boarding process.

The use of your personal information is necessary for us to know who you are, as we have a legal obligation to comply with “Know Your Customer” and customer due diligence regulatory obligations.
    
    **Compliance with a legal obligation**
    
    There are a number of legal obligations imposed by relevant laws to which we are subject, as well as specific statutory requirements e.g. anti-money laundering laws, financial services laws, corporation laws, privacy laws and tax laws. There are also various supervisory authorities whose laws and regulations apply to us. Such obligations and requirements imposed on us necessary personal data processing activities for identity verification, payment processing, compliance with court orders, tax laws or other reporting obligations and anti-money laundering controls.
    
    These obligations apply at various times, including client on-boarding, payments and systemic checks for risk management.
    
    **For the purpose of safeguarding legitimate interests**
    
    We process personal data so as to safeguard the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. A legitimate interest is when we have a business or commercial reason to use your information. Example of such processing activities include the following:
    
    *   Initiating legal claims and preparing our defense in litigation procedures;
        
    *   Means and processes we undertake to provide for the Company’s IT and system security, preventing potential crime, asset security and access controls;
        
    *   Measures for managing the business and for further developing products and services;
        
    *   Sharing your data within the Payward Inc. group of companies for the purpose of updating and/or verifying your personal data in accordance with the relevant anti-money laundering compliance frameworks, and
        
    *   Risk management.
        
    
    **To provide you with products and services, or information about our products and services, and to review your ongoing needs.**
    
    Once you successfully open an account with us, or subscribe to information, we must use your personal information to perform our services and comply with our obligations to you. It is also in our legitimate interests to try to ensure that we are providing the best products and services so we may periodically review your needs based on our assessment of your personal information to ensure that you are getting the benefit of the best possible products and services from us.
    
    **To help us improve our products and services, including support services, and develop and market new products and services.**
    
    We may, from time-to-time, use personal information provided by you through your use of the services and/or through client surveys to help us improve our products and services. It is in our legitimate interests to use your personal information in this way to try to ensure the highest standards when providing you with our products and services and to continue to be a market leader within the cryptocurrency financial service industry.
    
    **To investigate or settle enquiries or disputes**
    
    We may need to use personal information collected from you to investigate issues or to settle disputes with you because it is our legitimate interest to ensure that issues and disputes get investigated and resolved in a timely and efficient manner.
    
    **To comply with applicable laws, subpoenas, court orders, other judicial process, or the requirements of any applicable regulatory authorities**
    
    We may need to use your personal information to comply with any applicable laws and regulations, subpoenas, court orders or other judicial processes, or requirements of any applicable regulatory authority. We do this not only to comply with our legal obligations but because it may also be in our legitimate interest to do so.
    
    **To send you surveys**
    
    From time to time, we may send you surveys as part of our client feedback process. It is in our legitimate interest to ask for such feedback to try to ensure that we provide our products and services at the highest standard. However, we may from time to time also ask you to participate in other surveys and if you agree to participate in such surveys we rely on your consent to use the personal information we collect as part of such surveys. All responses to any survey we send out whether for client feedback or otherwise will be aggregated and depersonalised before the results are published and shared.
    
    **Data analysis**
    
    Our website pages and emails may contain web beacons or pixel tags or any other similar types of data analysis tools that allow us to track receipt of correspondence and count the number of users that have visited our webpage or opened our correspondence. We may aggregate your personal information with the personal information of our other clients on an anonymous basis (that is, with your personal identifiers removed), so that more rigorous statistical analysis of general patterns may lead us to providing better products and services.
    
    If your personal information is completely anonymised, we do not require a legal basis as the information will no longer constitute personal information. If your personal information is not in an anonymised form, it is in our legitimate interest to continually evaluate that personal information to ensure that the products and services we provide are relevant to the market.
    
    **Marketing purposes**
    
    We may use your personal information to send you marketing communications by email or other agreed forms (including social media campaigns), to ensure you are always kept up-to-date with our latest products and services. If we send you marketing communications we will do so based on your consent and registered marketing preferences.
    
    **Internal business purposes and record keeping**
    
    We may need to process your personal information for internal business and research purposes as well as for record keeping purposes. Such processing is in our own legitimate interests and is required in order to comply with our legal obligations. This may include any communications that we have with you in relation to the products and services we provide to you and our relationship with you. We will also keep records to ensure that you comply with your contractual obligations pursuant to the agreement (‘Terms of Service”) governing our relationship with you.
    
    **Legal Notifications**
    
    Often the law requires us to advise you of certain changes to products or services or laws. We may need to inform you of changes to the terms or the features of our products or services. We need to process your personal information to send you these legal notifications. You will continue to receive this information from us even if you choose not to receive direct marketing information from us.
    
7.  Disclosure of your personal information
    ---------------------------------------
    
    The Company will not disclose any of its clients’ confidential information to a third party, except: (a) to the extent that it is required to do so pursuant to any applicable laws, rules or regulations; (b) if there is a duty to disclose; (c) if our legitimate business interests require disclosure; (d) in line with our Terms of Service; (e) at your request or with your consent or to those described in this Privacy Notice. The Company will endeavour to make such disclosures on a “need-to-know” basis, unless otherwise instructed by a regulatory authority. Under such circumstances, the Company will notify the third party regarding the confidential nature of any such information.
    
    As part of using your personal information for the purposes set out above, the Company may disclose your personal information to the following:
    
    *   Any members of the Company, which means that any of our affiliates and subsidiaries may receive such information;
        
    *   Any of our service providers and business partners, for business purposes, such as specialist advisors who have been contracted to provide us with administrative, financial, legal, tax, compliance, insurance, IT, debt-recovery, analytics, research or other services;
        
    
    If the Company discloses your personal information to service providers and business partners, in order to perform the services requested by clients, such providers and partners may store your personal information within their own systems in order to comply with their legal and other obligations.
    
    We require that service providers and business partners who process personal information to acknowledge the confidentiality of this information, undertake to respect any client’s right to privacy and comply with all relevant privacy and data protection laws and this Privacy Notice.
    
8.  Where we store your personal data
    ---------------------------------
    
    Our operations are supported by a network of computers, servers, and other infrastructure and information technology, including, but not limited to, third-party service providers. We and our third-party service providers and business partners store and process your personal data in the European Union, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and elsewhere in the world.
    
9.  Transfers of personal information outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK)
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    We may transfer your personal information outside the EEA and UK to other Company subsidiaries, service providers and business partners (i.e Data Processors) who are engaged on our behalf. To the extent that we transfer your personal information outside of the EEA and UK, we will ensure that the transfer is lawful and that Data Processors in third countries are obliged to comply with the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Act 2016 and the UK Data Protection Act 2018. If transfers of personal information are processed in the US, we may in some cases rely on standard contractual clauses.
    
10.  Transfers of Personal Information outside of your country
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    
    By using our products and services, you consent to your Personal Data being transferred to other countries, including countries that have differing levels of privacy and data protection laws than your country. In all such transfers, we will protect your personal information as described in this Privacy Notice, and ensure that appropriate information sharing contractual agreements are in place.
    
11.  Privacy when using digital assets and blockchains
    -------------------------------------------------
    
    Your funding of bitcoin, XRP, ether, and other Digital Assets, may be recorded on a public blockchain. Public blockchains are distributed ledgers, intended to immutably record transactions across wide networks of computer systems. Many blockchains are open to forensic analysis which can lead to deanonymization and the unintentional revelation of private financial information, especially when blockchain data is combined with other data.
    
    Because blockchains are decentralized or third-party networks which are not controlled or operated by Payward or its affiliates, we are not able to erase, modify, or alter personal data from such networks.
    
12.  Data Retention
    --------------
    
    Safeguarding the privacy of your personal information is of utmost importance to us, whether you interact with us personally, by phone, by email, over the internet or any other electronic medium. We will hold personal information, for as long as we have a business relationship with you, in secure computer storage facilities, and we take the necessary measures to protect the personal information we hold from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.
    
    When we consider that personal information is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, we will remove any details that will identify you or we will securely destroy the records. However, we may need to maintain records for a significant period of time (after you cease being our client). For example, we are subject to certain anti-money laundering laws which require us to retain the following, for a period of 5 years after our business relationship with you has ended.
    
    *   A copy of the records we used in order to comply with our client due diligence obligations;
        
    *   Supporting evidence and records of transactions with you and your relationship with us.
        
    
    Also, the personal information we hold in the form of a recorded information, by telephone, electronically or otherwise, will be held in line with local regulatory requirements (i.e. 5 years after our business relationship with you has ended or longer if you have legitimate interests (such as handling a dispute with you)). If you have opted out of receiving marketing communications we will hold your details on our suppression list so that we know you do not want to receive these communications.
    
    We may keep your data for longer than 5 years if we cannot delete it for legal, regulatory, or technical reasons.
    
13.  Cookies
    -------
    
    When you use our products and services, we may make use of the standard practice of placing tiny data files called cookies, flash cookies, pixel tags, or other tracking tools (herein, “Cookies”) on your computer or other devices used when engaging with us. We use Cookies to (i) help us recognize you as a customer, collect information about your use of our products and services, to better customize our services and content for you, and to collect information about your computer or other access devices to ensure our compliance with our BSA and AML obligations.

    **Objection**
    
    You can ask us to stop processing your personal information, and we will do so, if we are:

    *   Processing your personal information for direct marketing; or

    If we have made a decision about you based solely on an automated process (e.g. through automatic profiling) that affects your ability to access our products and services or has another significant effect on you, you can request not to be subject to such a decision unless we can demonstrate to you that such decision is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between you and us. Even if a decision is necessary for entering into or performing a contract, you may contest the decision and require human intervention. We may not be able to offer our products or services to you, if we agree to such a request (i.e. end our relationship with you).
