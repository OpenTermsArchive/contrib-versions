Google Measurement Controller-Controller Data Protection Terms
==============================================================

The Measurement Services customer agreeing to these terms (“**Customer**”) has entered into an agreement with either Google or a third party reseller (as applicable) for the provision of the Measurement Services (as amended from time to time, the “**Agreement**”) through which services user interface Customer has enabled the Data Sharing Setting.

These Google Measurement Controller-Controller Data Protection Terms (“**Controller Terms**”) are entered into by Google and Customer. Where the Agreement is between Customer and Google, these Controller Terms supplement the Agreement. Where the Agreement is between Customer and a third party reseller, these Controller Terms form a separate agreement between Google and Customer.

For the avoidance of doubt, the provision of the Measurement Services is governed by the Agreement. These Controller Terms set out the data protection provisions relating to the Data Sharing Setting only but do not otherwise apply to the provision of the Measurement Services.

Subject to Section 7.2 (Processor Terms), these Controller Terms will be effective, and replace any previously applicable terms relating to their subject matter, from the Terms Effective Date.

If you are accepting these Controller Terms on behalf of Customer, you warrant that: (a) you have full legal authority to bind Customer to these Controller Terms; (b) you have read and understand these Controller Terms; and (c) you agree, on behalf of Customer, to these Controller Terms. If you do not have the legal authority to bind Customer, please do not accept these Controller Terms.

Please do not accept these Controller Terms if you are a reseller. These Controller Terms set out the rights and obligations that apply between users of the Measurement Services and Google.
