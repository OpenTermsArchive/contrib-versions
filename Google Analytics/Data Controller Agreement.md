Google Measurement Controller-Controller Data Protection Terms
==============================================================

We are making changes to the Google Measurement Controller-Controller Data Protection Terms. These updates will apply from September 1 2023. You can find the terms that apply prior to September 1, 2023 [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/13776363).

The Measurement Services customer agreeing to these terms (“**Customer**”) has entered into an agreement with either Google or a third party reseller (as applicable) for the provision of the Measurement Services (as amended from time to time, the “**Agreement**”) through which services user interface Customer has enabled the Data Sharing Setting.

These Google Measurement Controller-Controller Data Protection Terms (“**Controller Terms**”) are entered into by Google and Customer. Where the Agreement is between Customer and Google, these Controller Terms supplement the Agreement. Where the Agreement is between Customer and a third party reseller, these Controller Terms form a separate agreement between Google and Customer.

For the avoidance of doubt, the provision of the Measurement Services is governed by the Agreement. These Controller Terms set out the data protection provisions relating to the Data Sharing Setting only but do not otherwise apply to the provision of the Measurement Services.

Subject to Section 6.2 (No Effect on Processor Terms), these Controller Terms will be effective, and replace any previously applicable terms relating to their subject matter, from the Terms Effective Date.

If you are accepting these Controller Terms on behalf of Customer, you warrant that: (a) you have full legal authority to bind Customer to these Controller Terms; (b) you have read and understand these Controller Terms; and (c) you agree, on behalf of Customer, to these Controller Terms. If you do not have the legal authority to bind Customer, please do not accept these Controller Terms.

Please do not accept these Controller Terms if you are a reseller. These Controller Terms set out the rights and obligations that apply between users of the Measurement Services and Google.

* (a) Google LLC acts as data importer and Customer acts as data exporter under the Controller SCCs; and
* (b) Customer terminates the Agreement in accordance with Clause 16(c) of the Controller SCCs, then for the purposes of Clause 16(d) of the Controller SCCs, Customer directs Google to delete Controller Personal Data, and, unless European Laws require storage, Google will facilitate such deletion as soon as is reasonably practicable, to the extent such deletion is reasonably possible (taking into account that Google is an independent Controller of such data, as well as the nature and functionality of the Controller Services).

* (b) Customer’s Security Assessment. Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Security Measures implemented and maintained by Google as set out in paragraph 3.3.1(a) (Google’s Security Measures) provide a level of security appropriate to the risk in respect of Customer Personal Data, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing of Customer Personal Data as well as the risks to individuals.
* (c) Customer’s Audit Rights.
    * (i) Customer may conduct an audit to verify Google’s compliance with its obligations under this Appendix 1B by requesting and reviewing (1) a certificate issued for security verification reflecting the outcome of an audit conducted by a third party auditor (e.g., SOC 2 Type II or ISO/IEC 27001 certification or a comparable certification or other security certification of an audit conducted by a third-party auditor agreed by Customer and Google) within 12 months as of the date of Customer’s request and (2) any other information Google determines is reasonably necessary for Customer to verify such compliance.
    * (ii) Alternatively, Google may, at its sole discretion and in response to a request by Customer, initiate a third-party audit to verify Google’s compliance with its obligations under this Appendix 1B.

Where Customer requests such an audit, Google may charge a fee (based on Google’s reasonable costs) for any audit.

Customer will be responsible for any fees charged by any third-party auditor appointed by Customer to execute any such audit.
    * (iii) Nothing in this Appendix 1B will require Google either to disclose to Customer or its third-party auditor, or to allow Customer or its third-party auditor to access:
        * (1) any data of any other customer of a Google Entity;
        * (2) any Google Entity’s internal accounting or financial information;
        * (3) any trade secret of a Google Entity;
        * (4) any information that, in Google's reasonable opinion, could: (A) compromise the security of any Google Entity’s systems or premises; or (B) cause any Google Entity to breach its obligations under the US State Privacy Laws or its security and/or privacy obligations to Customer or any third party; or
        * (5) any information that Customer or its third party auditor seeks to access for any reason other than the good faith fulfillment of Customer’s obligations under the US State Privacy Laws.
