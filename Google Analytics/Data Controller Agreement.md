Google Measurement Controller-Controller Data Protection Terms
==============================================================

We are making changes to these Google Measurement Controller-Controller Data Protection Terms (Controller Terms). If you accepted the Controller Terms on or after September 27, 2021, these updates will apply to your use of the relevant service(s) immediately. If you accepted the Controller Terms before September 27, 2021, these updates will apply to your use of the relevant service(s) from October 27, 2021 onwards. For our legacy terms, [see here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11156289).

The Measurement Services customer agreeing to these terms (“**Customer**”) has entered into an agreement with either Google or a third party reseller (as applicable) for the provision of the Measurement Services (as amended from time to time, the “**Agreement**”) through which services user interface Customer has enabled the Data Sharing Setting.

These Google Measurement Controller-Controller Data Protection Terms (“**Controller Terms**”) are entered into by Google and Customer. Where the Agreement is between Customer and Google, these Controller Terms supplement the Agreement. Where the Agreement is between Customer and a third party reseller, these Controller Terms form a separate agreement between Google and Customer.

For the avoidance of doubt, the provision of the Measurement Services is governed by the Agreement. These Controller Terms set out the data protection provisions relating to the Data Sharing Setting only but do not otherwise apply to the provision of the Measurement Services.

Subject to Section 8.4 (No Effect on Processor Terms), these Controller Terms will be effective, and replace any previously applicable terms relating to their subject matter, from the Terms Effective Date.

If you are accepting these Controller Terms on behalf of Customer, you warrant that: (a) you have full legal authority to bind Customer to these Controller Terms; (b) you have read and understand these Controller Terms; and (c) you agree, on behalf of Customer, to these Controller Terms. If you do not have the legal authority to bind Customer, please do not accept these Controller Terms.

Please do not accept these Controller Terms if you are a reseller. These Controller Terms set out the rights and obligations that apply between users of the Measurement Services and Google.

-----------------------------------------

### 3.1 Application of European Data Protection Legislation

These Controller Terms will only apply to the extent that the European Data Protection Legislation applies to the processing of Controller Personal Data.

### 3.2 Application to Data Sharing Setting

These Controller Terms will only apply to the Data Sharing Setting for which the parties agreed to these Controller Terms (for example, the Data Sharing Setting for which Customer clicked to accept these Controller Terms).

### 3.3 Duration

These Controller Terms will apply from the Terms Effective Date and continue while Google or Customer processes Controller Personal Data, after which these Controller Terms will automatically terminate.

4\. Roles and Restrictions on Processing
----------------------------------------

### 4.1 Independent Controllers

Subject to Section 4.4 (End Controllers), each:

*   (a) is an independent controller of Controller Personal Data under the European Data Protection Legislation;
*   (b) will individually determine the purposes and means of its processing of Controller Personal Data; and
*   (c) will comply with the obligations applicable to it under the European Data Protection Legislation regarding the processing of Controller Personal Data.

### 4.2 Restrictions on Processing

Section 4.1 (Independent Controllers) will not affect any restrictions on either party’s rights to use or otherwise process Controller Personal Data under the Agreement.

### 4.3 End User Consent

Customer will comply with the Policies in relation to the Controller Personal Data shared pursuant to the Data Sharing Setting and at all times will bear the burden of proof in establishing such compliance.

### 4.4 End Controllers

Without reducing either party’s obligations under these Controller Terms, each party acknowledges that: (a) the other party’s Affiliates or clients may be End Controllers; and (b) the other party may act as a processor on behalf of its End Controllers. The Google End Controllers are: (i) for European Controller Personal Data processed by Google, Google Ireland Limited; and (ii) for UK Controller Personal Data processed by Google, Google LLC. Each party will ensure that its End Controllers comply with the Controller Terms, including (where applicable) the Controller UK SCCs.

5\. Data Transfers
------------------

### 5.1 Restricted Transfers

Subject to Section 5.3 (Transfers of UK Controller Personal Data to Google), either party may make Restricted Transfers if it complies with the provisions on Restricted Transfers in the European Data Protection Legislation.

### 5.2 Alternative Transfer Solution

If Google announces its adoption of an Alternative Transfer Solution for any Restricted Transfers, then: (a) Google will ensure that such Restricted Transfers are made in accordance with that Alternative Transfer Solution, and (b) Sections 5.3 (Transfers of UK Controller Personal Data to Google) to 5.8 (Third Party Controllers) will not apply to such Restricted Transfers.

### 5.3 Transfers of UK Controller Personal Data to Google

To the extent that Customer transfers UK Controller Personal Data to Google, Customer as data exporter will be deemed to have entered into the Controller UK SCCs with Google LLC (the applicable Google End Controller) as data importer and the transfers will be subject to the Controller UK SCCs, because Google LLC is established in the USA and such transfers are therefore Restricted Transfers. For clarity, to the extent Customer transfers European Controller Personal Data to Google, no transfer mechanism under Chapter V of the EU GDPR is required because Google Ireland Limited (the applicable Google End Controller) is established in Ireland and such transfers are therefore Permitted Transfers.

### 5.4 Additional Commercial Clauses for the Controller UK SCCs

Sections 5.5 (Contacting Google) to 5.8 (Third Party Controllers) are additional commercial clauses relating to the Controller UK SCCs as permitted by Clause VII (Variation of these clauses) of the Controller UK SCCs. Nothing in Sections 5.5 (Contacting Google) to 5.8 (Third Party Controllers) varies or modifies any rights or obligations of the parties to the Controller UK SCCs.

### 5.5 Contacting Google

Customer may contact Google Ireland Limited and/or Google LLC in connection with the Controller UK SCCs at [https://support.google.com/policies/troubleshooter/9009584](https://support.google.com/policies/troubleshooter/9009584) or through such other means as may be provided by Google from time to time, including for the purposes of requesting an Audit under Section 5.7 (a) (Reviews, Audits and Certifications of Compliance) below, to the extent applicable under the Controller UK SCCs.

### 5.6 Responding to Data Subject Enquiries

For the purpose of Clause I(d) of the Controller UK SCCs, the applicable data importer will be responsible for responding to enquiries from data subjects and the authority concerning the processing of applicable Controller Personal Data by the data importer.

### 5.7 Reviews, Audits and Certifications of Compliance

*   (a) If the Controller UK SCCs apply under this Section 5 (Data Transfers), the applicable data importer will allow the applicable data exporter or a third party inspection agent or auditor appointed by the data exporter to conduct a review, audit and/or certification as described in the Controller UK SCCs (“Audit”) in accordance with this Section 5.7 (Reviews, Audits and Certifications of Compliance).
*   (b) Following receipt by the data importer of a request for an Audit, the data importer and the data exporter will discuss and agree in advance on the reasonable start date, scope and duration of, and security and confidentiality controls applicable to, the Audit.
*   (c) The data importer may charge a fee (based on the data importer’s reasonable costs) for any Audit. The data importer will provide the data exporter with further details of any applicable fee, and the basis of its calculation, in advance of the Audit. The data exporter will be responsible for any fees charged by any third party inspection agent or auditor appointed by the data exporter to execute the Audit.
*   (d) The data importer may object to any third party inspection agent or auditor appointed by the data exporter to conduct any Audit if the inspection agent or auditor is, in the data importer’s reasonable opinion, not suitably qualified or independent, a competitor of the data importer or otherwise manifestly unsuitable. Any such objection by the data importer will require the data exporter to appoint another inspection agent or auditor or conduct the Audit itself.
*   (e) The data importer will not be required either to disclose to the data exporter or its third party inspection agent or auditor, or to allow the data exporter or its third party inspection agent or auditor to access:
    *   (i) any data of any customers of the data importer or any of its Affiliates;
    *   (ii) any internal accounting or financial information of the data importer or any of its Affiliates;
    *   (iii) any trade secret of the data importer or any of its Affiliates;
    *   (iv) any information that, in the data importer’s reasonable opinion, could: (A) compromise the security of any systems or premises of the data importer or any of its Affiliates; or (B) cause the data importer or any Affiliate of the data importer to breach its obligations under the European Data Protection Legislation or its security and/or privacy obligations to the data exporter or any third party; or
    *   (v) any information that the data exporter or its third party inspection agent or auditor seeks to access for any reason other than the good faith fulfillment of the data exporter’s obligations under the European Data Protection Legislation.

### 5.8 Third Party Controllers

To the extent Google LLC acts as data importer and Customer acts as data exporter under the Controller UK SCCs under Section 5.3 (Transfers of UK Controller Personal Data to Google), Google notifies Customer for the purpose of Clause II(i) of the Controller UK SCCs that UK Controller Personal Data may be transferred to the third party data controllers described in applicable Help Centre articles for the Measurement Services.

6\. Liability
-------------

### 6.1 Liability Cap

If Google is:

*   (a) party to the Agreement and the Agreement is governed by the laws of:
    *   (i) a state of the United States of America, then, regardless of anything else in the Agreement, the total liability of either party towards the other party under or in connection with these Controller Terms will be limited to the maximum monetary or payment-based amount at which that party’s liability is capped under the Agreement (and therefore, any exclusion of indemnification claims from the Agreement’s limitation of liability will not apply to indemnification claims under the Agreement relating to the European Data Protection Legislation); or
    *   (ii) a jurisdiction that is not a state of the United States of America, then the liability of the parties under or in connection with these Controller Terms will be subject to the exclusions and limitations of liability in the Agreement; or
*   (b) not party to the Agreement, to the extent permitted by applicable law, Google will not be liable for Customer’s lost revenues or indirect, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary or punitive damages, even if Google or its Affiliates have been advised of, knew or should have known that such damages do not satisfy a remedy. Google’s (and its Affiliates’) total cumulative liability to Customer or any other party for any loss or damages resulting from claims, damages or actions arising out of or relating to these Controller Terms will not exceed $500 (USD).

### 6.2 Liability if the Controller UK SCCs Apply

If the Controller UK SCCs apply under Section 5 (Data Transfers), then:

(a) if Google is party to the Agreement, the total combined liability of: (i) Google and Google LLC towards Customer; and (ii) Customer towards Google, Google LLC and Google Ireland Limited; under or in connection with the Agreement and the Controller UK SCCs combined will be subject to Section 6.1(a) (Liability Cap). Clause III(a) of the Controller UK SCCs will not affect the previous sentence.

(b) if Google is not party to the Agreement, the total combined liability of: (i) Google and Google LLC towards Customer; and (ii) Customer towards Google, Google LLC and Google Ireland Limited; under or in connection with these Controller Terms and the Controller UK SCCs combined will be subject to Section 6.1(b) (Liability Cap). Clause III(a) of the Controller UK SCCs will not affect the previous sentence.

7\. Third Party Beneficiaries
-----------------------------

Where Google LLC is not a party to the Agreement but is a party to the Controller UK SCCs, Google LLC will be a third-party beneficiary of Sections 4.4 (End Controllers), 5.3 (Transfers of UK Controller Personal Data to Google) to 5.8 (Third Party Controllers), and 6.1 (Liability Cap) to 6.2 (Liability if the Controller UK SCCs Apply). To the extent this Section 7 conflicts or is inconsistent with any other clause in the Agreement, this Section 7 will apply.

8\. Effect of Controller UK SCCs
--------------------------------

### 8.1 Order of Precedence

If there is any conflict or inconsistency between the Controller UK SCCs, the Additional Terms for Non-European Data Protection Legislation, the remainder of these Controller Terms and/or the remainder of the Agreement then, subject to Sections 4.2 (Restrictions on Processing) and 8.4 (No Effect on Processor Terms), the following order of precedence will apply: (a) the Controller UK SCCs (if applicable); (b) the Additional Terms for Non-European Data Protection Legislation (if applicable); (c) the remainder of these Controller Terms; and (d) the remainder of the Agreement (if applicable). Subject to the amendments in these Controller Terms, the Agreement between Google and Customer remains in full force and effect.

### 8.2 Additional Commercial Clauses

Sections 5.5 (Contacting Google) to 5.8 (Third Party Controllers), and Section 6.2 (Liability if Controller UK SCCs Apply) are additional commercial clauses as permitted by Clause VII (Variation of these Clauses) of the Controller UK SCCs.

### 8.3 No Modification of Controller UK SCCs

Nothing in the Agreement (including these Controller Terms) is intended to modify or contradict any Controller UK SCCs or prejudice the fundamental rights or freedoms of data subjects under the European Data Protection Legislation.

### 8.4 No Effect on Processor Terms

These Controller Terms will not replace or affect any Processor Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, if Customer is party to the Processor Terms in connection with the Measurement Services, the Processor Terms will continue to apply to the Measurement Services notwithstanding that these Controller Terms apply to Controller Personal Data processed pursuant to the Data Sharing Setting.

9\. Changes to these Controller Terms
-------------------------------------

### 9.1 Changes to Controller Terms

Google may change these Controller Terms if the change:

*   (a) is required to comply with applicable law, applicable regulation, a court order or guidance issued by a governmental regulator or agency, or reflects Google’s adoption of an Alternative Transfer Solution; or
*   (b) does not: (i) seek to alter the categorisation of the parties as independent controllers of Controller Personal Data under the European Data Protection Legislation; (ii) expand the scope of, or remove any restrictions on, either party’s rights to use or otherwise process Controller Personal Data; or (iii) have a material adverse impact on Customer, as reasonably determined by Google.

### 9.2 Notification of Changes

If Google intends to change these Controller Terms under Section 9.1(a) and such change will have a material adverse impact on Customer, as reasonably determined by Google, then Google will use commercially reasonable efforts to inform Customer at least 30 days (or such shorter period as may be required to comply with applicable law, applicable regulation, a court order or guidance issued by a governmental regulator or agency) before the change will take effect. If Customer objects to any such change, Customer may switch off the Data Sharing Setting.
