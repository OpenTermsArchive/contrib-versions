These Google Analytics Terms of Service (this **"Agreement"**) are entered into by Google Ireland Limited (**"Google"**) and the entity executing this Agreement (**"You"**). This Agreement governs Your use of the standard Google Analytics service (the **"Service"**). BY CLICKING THE "I ACCEPT" BUTTON, COMPLETING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE REVIEWED AND ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT AND ARE AUTHORISED TO ACT ON BEHALF OF, AND BIND TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OWNER OF THIS ACCOUNT. In consideration of the parties’ respective rights and obligations that are described in this Agreement, the parties agree as follows:

1\. Definitions.
----------------

_**"Account"**_ refers to the account for the Service. All Profiles (as applicable) linked to a single Property will have their Hits aggregated before determining the charge for the Service for that Property.

_**"Confidential Information"**_ includes any proprietary data and any other information disclosed by one party to the other in writing and marked "confidential" or disclosed orally and, within five business days, reduced to writing and marked "confidential". However, Confidential Information will not include any information that is or becomes known to the general public, which is already in the receiving party's possession prior to disclosure by a party or which is independently developed by the receiving party without the use of Confidential Information.

_**"Customer Data"**_ or “Google Analytics Data" means the data that you collect, process or store using the Service concerning the characteristics and activities of Users.

_**"Documentation"**_ means any accompanying documentation made available to You by Google for use with the Processing Software, including any documentation available online.

_**"GAMC"**_ means the Google Analytics Measurement Code, which is installed on a Property for the purpose of collecting Customer Data, together with any fixes, updates and upgrades provided to You.

“Google Affiliates” means Google, Google LLC and Google LLC’s wholly owned subsidiaries.

_**“Hit”**_ means a collection of interactions that results in data being sent to the Service and processed. Examples of Hits may include page view hits and ecommerce hits. A Hit can be a call to the Service by various libraries, but does not have to be so (e.g., a Hit can be delivered to the Service by other Google Analytics-supported protocols and mechanisms made available by the Service to You).

_**“Platform Home”**_ means the user interface through which You can access certain Google Marketing Platform-level functionality.

_**"Processing Software"**_ means the Google Analytics server-side software and any upgrades, which analyses the Customer Data and generates the Reports.

_**"Profile"**_ means the collection of settings that together determine the information to be included in, or excluded from, a particular Report. For example, a Profile could be established to view a small portion of a web site as a unique Report.

_**"Property"**_ means any web page, application, other property or resource under Your control that sends data to Google Analytics.

_**"Privacy Policy"**_ means the privacy policy on a Property.

_**"Report"**_ means the resulting analysis shown at www.google.com/analytics/, some of which may include analysis for a Profile.

_**“SDKs”**_ mean certain software development kits, which may be used or incorporated into a Property app for the purpose of collecting Customer Data, together with any fixes, updates, and upgrades provided to You.

_**"Servers"**_ means the servers controlled by a Google Affiliate on which the Processing Software and Customer Data are stored.

_**"Software"**_ means the Processing Software, GAMC and/or SDKs.

_**"Third Party"**_ means any third party (i) to which You provide access to Your Account or (ii) for which You use the Service to collect information on the third party's behalf.

_**"Users"**_ means users and/or visitors to Your Properties.

The words _**"include"**_ and _**"including"**_ mean "including but not limited to".

2\. Fees and Service.
---------------------

Subject to Section 15, the Service is provided without charge to You for up to 10 million Hits per month per Account. Google may change its fees and payment policies for the Service from time to time including the addition of costs for geographic data, the importing of cost data from search engines or other fees charged to Google or another Google Affiliate by third-party vendors for the inclusion of data in the Service reports. The changes to the fees or payment policies are effective upon Your acceptance of those changes which will be posted at [www.google.com/analytics/](https://www.google.com/analytics/). Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in US Dollars. Any outstanding balance becomes immediately due and payable upon termination of this Agreement and any collection expenses (including legal fees) incurred by Google will be included in the amount owed, and may be charged to the credit card or other billing mechanism associated with Your Google Ads account.

3\. Member Account, Password and Security.
------------------------------------------

To register for the Service, You must complete the registration process by providing Google with current, complete and accurate information as prompted by the registration form, including Your e-mail address (username) and password. You will protect Your passwords and take full responsibility for Your own, and third-party, use of Your accounts. You are solely responsible for any and all activities that occur under Your Account (save for activities carried out by, or on behalf of, Google Affiliates). You will notify Google immediately upon learning of any unauthorised use of Your Account or any other breach of security. Google Affiliates’ support staff may, from time to time, log in to the Service under Your customer password in order to maintain the service, including to provide You assistance with technical or billing issues.

4\. Nonexclusive Licence.
-------------------------

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (a) Google grants You a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-sub-licensable licence to install, copy and use the GAMC and/or SDKs solely as necessary for You to use the Service on Your Properties or Third Party Properties; and (b) You may remotely access, view and download Your Reports stored at [www.google.com/analytics/](https://www.google.com/analytics/). You will not (and You will not allow any third party to) (i) copy, modify, adapt, translate or otherwise create derivative works of the Software or the Documentation; (ii) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise attempt to discover the source code of the Software, except as expressly permitted by the law in effect in the jurisdiction in which You are located; (iii) rent, lease, sell, assign or otherwise transfer rights in or to the Software, the Documentation or the Service; (iv) remove any proprietary notices or labels on the Software or placed by the Service; (v) use, post, transmit or introduce any device, software or routine which interferes or attempts to interfere with the operation of the Service or the Software; or (vi) use data labelled as belonging to a third party in the Service for purposes other than generating, viewing and downloading Reports. You will comply with all applicable laws and regulations in Your use of and access to the Documentation, Software, Service and Reports.

5\. Confidentiality and Beta Features.
--------------------------------------

Neither party will use or disclose the other party's Confidential Information without the other's prior written consent except for the purpose of performing its obligations under this Agreement or if required by law, regulation or court order; in which case, the party being compelled to disclose Confidential Information will give the other party as much notice as is reasonably practicable prior to disclosing the Confidential Information. Certain Service features are identified as "Alpha," "Beta," "Experiment," (either within the Service or elsewhere by Google) or as otherwise unsupported or confidential (collectively, **"Beta Features"**). You may not disclose any information from Beta Features or the terms or existence of any non-public Beta Features. Subject to Section 11(a), Google and the Google Affiliates will have no liability (including any indemnification obligations) arising out of or related to any Beta Features. Any use of Beta Features will be solely at Your own risk and may be subject to additional requirements as specified by Google. Google is not obligated to provide support for Beta Features and Google may, at its sole discretion, cease providing Beta Features as part of any Services.

6\. Information Rights and Publicity.
-------------------------------------

Google will not share Your Customer Data or any Third Party's Customer Data with any third parties unless Google (i) has Your consent for any Customer Data or any Third Party's consent for the Third Party's Customer Data; (ii) concludes that it is required by law or has a good faith belief that access, preservation or disclosure of Customer Data is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of Google, its users or the public; or (iii) provides Customer Data in certain limited circumstances to third parties to carry out tasks on Google's behalf (e.g. billing or data storage) with strict restrictions that prevent the data from being used or shared except as directed by Google. When this is done, it is subject to agreements that oblige those parties to process Customer Data only on Google's instructions and in compliance with this Agreement and appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

7\. Privacy.
------------

You will not and will not assist or permit any third party to, pass information to Google that Google could use or recognise as personally identifiable information. You will have and abide by an appropriate Privacy Policy and will comply with all applicable laws, policies and regulations relating to the collection of information from Users. You must post a Privacy Policy and that Privacy Policy must provide notice of Your use of cookies, identifiers for mobile devices (e.g., Android Advertising Identifier or Advertising Identifier for iOS) or similar technology used to collect data. You must disclose the use of Google Analytics, and how it collects and processes data. This can be done by displaying a prominent link to the site “How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps”, (located at [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/), or any other URL that Google may provide from time to time). You will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that a User is provided with clear and comprehensive information about, and consents to, the storing and accessing of cookies or other information on the User’s device where such activity occurs in connection with the Service and where providing such information and obtaining such consent is required by law.

You must not circumvent any privacy features (e.g. an opt-out) that are part of the Service. You will comply with all applicable Google Analytics policies located at [www.google.com/analytics/policies/](https://www.google.com/analytics/policies/) (or such other URL as Google may provide) as modified from time to time (the **“Google Analytics Policies”**).

You may participate in an integrated version of Google Analytics and certain Google advertising services (**"Google Analytics Advertising Features"**). If You use Google Analytics Advertising Features, You will adhere to the Google Analytics Advertising Features policy (available at [support.google.com/analytics/bin/answer.py?hl=en\_GB&topic=2611283&answer=2700409](https://support.google.com/analytics/bin/answer.py?hl=en_GB&topic=2611283&answer=2700409)) Your access to and use of any Google advertising service is subject to the applicable terms between You and Google regarding that service.

If You use the Platform Home, Your use of the Platform Home is subject to the Platform Home Additional Terms (or as subsequently re-named) available at [https://support.google.com/marketingplatform/answer/9047313](https://support.google.com/marketingplatform/answer/9047313) (or such other URL as Google may provide) as modified from time to time (the **"Platform Home Terms”**).

To the extent that Your use of the Service is within scope, You and Google agree to the Google Ads Data Processing Terms at [https://privacy.google.com/businesses/processorterms](https://privacy.google.com/businesses/processorterms) (the **“Processing Terms”**). Google will not modify the Processing Terms, except as expressly permitted under the Processing Terms.

Google will provide You with written notice of any claim, suit or action from which You must indemnify Google Affiliates. You will cooperate as fully as reasonably required in the defence of any claim. Google reserves the right, at its own expense, to enforce this Section 8 on behalf of all Google Affiliates and assume the exclusive defence and control of any matter subject to indemnification by You.

9\. Third Parties.
------------------

If You use the Service on behalf of the Third Party or a Third Party otherwise uses the Service through Your Account, whether or not You are authorised by Google to do so, then You represent and warrant that (a) You are authorised to act on behalf of, and bind to this Agreement, the Third Party to all obligations that You have under this Agreement, (b) Google may share with the Third Party any Customer Data that is specific to the Third Party's Properties, and (c) You will not disclose Third Party's Customer Data to any other party without the Third Party's consent.

17\. Google Analytics for Firebase.
-----------------------------------

If You link a Property to Firebase (**“Firebase Linkage”**) as part of using the Service, the following terms, in addition to Sections 1-16 above, will also apply to You, and will also govern Your use of the Service, including with respect to Your use of Firebase Linkage. Other than as modified below, all other terms will stay the same and continue to apply. In the event of a conflict between this Section 17 and Sections 1-16 above, the terms in Section 17 will govern and control solely with respect to Your use of the Firebase Linkage.

1.  The following definition in Section 1 is modified as follows:
    1.  "Hit" means a collection of interactions that results in data being sent to the Service and processed. Examples of Hits may include page view hits and ecommerce hits. A Hit can be a call to the Service by various libraries, but does not have to be so (e.g., a Hit can be delivered to the Service by other Google Analytics-supported protocols and mechanisms made available by the Service to You). For the sake of clarity, a Hit does not include certain events whose collection reflects interactions with certain Properties capable of supporting multiple data streams, and which may include screen views and custom events (the collection of events, an **“Enhanced Packet”**).
2.  The following sentence is added to the end of Section 7 as follows:
    1.  If You link a Property to a Firebase project (**“Firebase Linkage”**) (i) certain data from Your Property, including Customer Data, may be made accessible within or to any other entity or personnel according to permissions set in Firebase and (ii) that Property may have certain Service settings modified by authorized personnel of Firebase (notwithstanding the settings You may have designated for that Property within the Service).
