Revcontent may in its sole and absolute discretion amend, modify, or change the specifications, rules, and regulations. Specifications may change to allow for network enhancements, including, but not limited to, code changes, delivery improvements, and optimization of displays, tracking, and reporting of Articles. You shall not alter the code, link, script, programming, pixel, Article, content, and/or data provided to You by Revcontent without the prior express written consent of Revcontent.

**4\.    PUBLISHER DUTIES.**

You are solely responsible for Your Website(s) and/or Property(ies), including all content and materials, maintenance and operation thereof; the proper implementation of Revcontent specifications; adherence to the terms of this Agreement; all applicable laws, rules, regulations, statutes, and ordinances; compliance with all terms, conditions and requirements of any source of web traffic to your website(s); and any Revcontent rule, policy, or procedure. You hereby grant Revcontent the sole and exclusive right to investigate, at its own discretion, any violation, activity, or alleged breach of this Agreement, or any engagement in any activity prohibited by this Agreement. Revcontent shall not be liable or responsible for anything related to You or Your Websites, including, but not limited to, the receipt and/or collection of data, information, or queries from end users of Your Websites, or the transmission of any information or data between You, Your Website, and Revcontent. In addition, all Articles are provided on an “AS IS” or “AS AVAILABLE” basis and Revcontent makes no warranty or representation that such Articles will be available, delivered, or work properly. Revcontent is not required to notify You of any problems or issues relating to the Revcontent Network, the Program, or the Articles.

**5\.    SERVICE.**

Approved Publishers shall be permitted to participate in the Program and receive served Articles from Revcontent for publication on Publisher’s Website(s) and/or Property(ies). Revcontent will specify the amount and terms under which You will earn payment (“Bounties”). Bounties are generated from a specified transaction (“Action”) as defined by Revcontent. Actions can include, without limitation, clicks, click-throughs, sales, registrations, impressions and leads. The applicable Action associated with each campaign and/or Your account shall be set forth in the applicable terms listed on the Revcontent Network and, unless otherwise specified, such shall be subject to change at the sole and absolute discretion of Revcontent. If You accept Articles to run on your Website(s), You agree to adhere to any specific policies, procedures, and specifications associated with those Articles, and operate at all times in accordance with the Agreement. Revcontent may, at its sole discretion, change the Articles or the terms of a campaign at any time, without prior notice to You, unless otherwise specified. Similarly, You may cease participation in the Program at any time, unless otherwise specified in this Agreement or other terms associated with the campaign. Revcontent is responsible for displaying and administrating the Program and tracking associated Bounties and Actions. Program data compiled by Revcontent including, but not limited to, numbers and calculations regarding Actions and associated Bounties (“Program Data”), will be calculated by Revcontent through the use of tracking technology and shall be final and binding on You. Any questions regarding the Program Data must be submitted in writing seven (7) days of initial appearance in the tracking system; otherwise the Program Data will be deemed to be accurate and accepted by You. Publisher understands and agrees that on occasion the Service and/or Revcontent Network may be inaccessible, unavailable or inoperable for any reason, including, but not limited to, the following: (i) equipment malfunctions; (ii) periodic maintenance procedures or repairs; or (iii) causes beyond the control of Revcontent or which are not reasonably foreseeable by Revcontent including, but not limited to, interruption or failure of telecommunication or digital transmission links, hostile network attacks, the unavailability, operation, or inaccessibility of websites or interfaces, network congestion or other failures. Publisher acknowledges and agrees that Revcontent has no control over the availability of the Program, Services, and Revcontent Network on a continuous or uninterrupted basis. Terms of the Agreement are subject to Revcontent hardware, software, and bandwidth traffic limitations. Revcontent’s failure to deliver because of technical difficulties does not represent a failure to meet the obligations of the Agreement.

**6\.    SUB-PUBLISHERS.**

Publisher may desire to use its business partners and/or associates to fulfill the obligations or exercise the rights under a particular Program. For the purposes of this section, any of Publisher’s business partners or associates that participate in or perform any activities on behalf of Publisher under the Agreement shall be considered to be a “Sub-Publisher.” Revcontent reserves the right to review and approve or reject any and all Sub-Publishers and may revoke a prior approval of any Sub-Publisher at any time and for any reason.  Sub-Publishers must meet the same criteria for approval as the Publisher as set forth in the Agreement and must comply with all the terms and conditions that are applicable to Publisher under the Agreement and any and all other applicable terms required by Revcontent. Publisher is responsible for and shall fully and unconditionally indemnify Revcontent for any and all actions of any of its Sub-Publishers, including the payment of legal fees and costs if necessary. Further, Revcontent may, at its sole discretion, terminate a Publisher at any time based on the actions of that Publisher’s Sub-Publisher(s). Once express approval of a Sub-Publisher has been granted by Revcontent, notices to the Publisher shall be deemed notice to that Publisher’s approved Sub-Publisher(s).  Publisher agrees that Revcontent is under no obligation to pay a Sub-Publisher. Revcontent further reserves the right to withhold or refuse payment to any Publisher in the event that any of its Sub-Publishers breach the Agreement.

**7\.    TERMS OF PAYMENT.**

You agree to be paid the applicable Bounty rate for each Action verified by Revcontent as specified by Revcontent approximately thirty (30) days after the last day of a given calendar month, for Bounties realized in that month, subject to a reduction based on Revcontent’s expenses associated with the delivery of any traffic to advertisers which would have otherwise been blocked by ad block software. You agree that payment for Bounties will be owed to You from the applicable Advertiser, and that corresponding payments shall be made by Revcontent to You out of the funds actually collected by Revcontent from the applicable Advertiser. Revcontent shall have no payment obligation to Publisher where Advertiser has not remitted sufficient payments to cover the Bounties otherwise due and owing Publisher. All Publisher accounts will be paid in United States dollars ($US). Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no Bounty payments will be issued for any amounts otherwise due Publisher that total less than Fifty Dollars ($50.00) (“Payment Threshold”). Upon termination of the Agreement, all legitimate moneys due to Publisher that are actually collected from the applicable Advertiser, even amounts below the Payment Threshold, will be paid during the next billing cycle. Every Publisher account must have a unique, valid taxpayer identification number (TIN), valid Social Security Number, or other applicable unique government identification. All payments due hereunder shall be in U.S. dollars and are exclusive of any applicable taxes. Publisher is responsible for all applicable taxes (including without limitation VAT) with respect to Payments received from Revcontent and will on request provide a VAT invoice for any payments made to it by Revcontent if so requested by Revcontent.

An Advertiser may request that Revcontent, or Revcontent may on its own initiative, debit from the Bounties otherwise due and owing Publisher an amount equal to a Bounty previously credited to Publisher’s account where: (a) a return or cancellation has been made with respect to the applicable product and/or service; (b) there is an instance of a duplicate, fraudulent or incomplete entry or other similar error with respect to a customer order; (c) there are Actions that do not comply fully with the terms of the Agreement, including where the applicable non-complying Action is not the result of Publisher’s action, omission and/or failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the Agreement; (d) there is non-receipt of payment from, or refund of payment to, the customer that entered into the subject Action; or (e) there is any failure on the part of Publisher to comply with the Agreement and/or the applicable Program Terms (collectively referred to as a “Chargeback”). Chargebacks requested by an Advertiser in accordance with this Section may be applied up to one hundred and twenty (120) days after the end of the month in which the applicable Bounty was earned (“Chargeback Period”). An Advertiser may request that the payment of a Bounty be postponed for one (1) payment cycle where: (i) Advertiser is verifying a lead (for Programs in which lead generation is a component of the Action); (ii) Advertiser has a product return policy that allows the underlying purchaser to return the product during the Chargeback Period; or (iii) the applicable Program Terms provide for such a postponement. The number or amount of Actions, credits for payments and debits for Chargebacks, as calculated by Revcontent, shall be final and binding on Publisher. The parties expressly acknowledge, confirm, and agree that, at all times during Your participation in the Program, Revcontent specifically reserves the right to determine whether purported impressions and/or other Actions are in fact valid and give rise to Revcontent payment obligations pursuant to these Terms and Conditions and the terms of any applicable Insertion Order(s). This determination shall be made at Revcontent’s sole and absolute discretion, and may be made in consideration of the geographic location of users or any other factors deemed relevant by Revcontent in making such determination. Definition of Revenue for Revenue Share Arrangements: In the event the parties agree to a revenue share arrangement, Revcontent will pay you a revenue share based on “Net Revenue” which is defined as the gross revenue received by Revcontent as a result of valid clicks, less adjustments for chargebacks, commissions, direct cost charged to Revcontent by third party providers, discounts allowed, refunds and administrative fees, and bad debt deductions.

**8\.    FRAUD.**

Revcontent actively monitors traffic, Actions, Bounties and other Program-related activities for potential fraud. If Revcontent suspects that Your account has been used in a fraudulent manner, Your account will be deactivated effective immediately and with no notice to You pending further investigation. If You add Actions, or inflate Actions, through the use of fraudulent means of traffic generation, as determined solely by Revcontent, You will forfeit all of the Bounties related to that Program, and Your Publisher account will be terminated effective immediately. **Revcontent reserves sole judgment in determining fraud and You agree to be bound by any and all such determinations.** It is the OBLIGATION of Publisher to prove to Revcontent that it has NOT engaged in fraud. Revcontent will hold Your Bounty-related payments in 'Pending Status' until You have satisfactorily provided evidence that demonstrates to Revcontent that You have not engaged in fraud. If You are unable to provide Revcontent with satisfactory evidence that You have not engaged in fraud within seven (7) days of Your Bounties being placed in “Pending Status,” then Revcontent reserves the right to terminate Your Publisher account and cancel payment on the applicable Bounties, at its sole discretion and without any further obligations to You.

**9\.    TERMINATION.**

In addition, Revcontent reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to terminate You from the Program at any time for any reason, without notice to You. Revcontent also reserves the right to terminate Your access to the Revcontent Network at any time with or without notice to You. Termination notice may be provided via e-mail and will be effective immediately. Upon termination, Publisher agrees to immediately remove from its Website(s) and/or Property(ies) any and all Articles, content, materials, and Revcontent Code or other intellectual property made available to Publisher in connection with its performance under the Agreement. The representations, warranties and obligations of Publisher contained within the Agreement shall survive and remain in full force and effect after termination of the Agreement. All payment obligations accruing prior to the date of termination shall survive until fully fulfilled.

**23\.    RELATIONSHIP.**

Additionally, if either party brings any action for judicial relief in the first instance without first pursuing arbitration prior thereto, the party bringing such action for judicial relief will be liable for and will immediately pay to the other party all of the others party’s costs and expenses (including without limitation, court costs and attorneys’ fees) to stay or dismiss such judicial action and//or remove it to arbitration. The failure of either party to exercise any rights granted hereunder will not operate as a waiver of those rights. The arbitrators will not be empowered to award punitive damages. The consent of the parties to arbitrate their disputes shall survive termination of this Agreement. If this Agreement is found to not be subject to arbitration, each party herein consents, agrees, and affirmatively waives any right to a jury trial in any proceeding. The parties consent and agree that jurisdiction and venue shall be in within the Middle District of Florida, Sarasota County Florida.
