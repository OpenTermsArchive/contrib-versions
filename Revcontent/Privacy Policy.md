DATA TRANSFERS AND PRIVACY SHIELD

Revcontent is based in the U.S. As such, we and our service providers may transfer your information to, or store or access it in, jurisdictions that may not provide equivalent levels of data protection as your home jurisdiction. We will take steps to ensure that your personal data receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it.

When we transfer personal data from the European Union or Switzerland to the United States, we comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss - U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. Revcontent has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit [https://www.privacyshield.gov/](https://www.privacyshield.gov/).

In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, we are committed to resolving complaints about our processing of your personal data. EU and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our compliance with the Privacy Shield program should first contact us at [privacy@revcontent.com](mailto:privacy@revcontent.com) We have further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact or visit [https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield](https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield) claim for more information or to file a complaint.

HOW WE PROTECT THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT

We take reasonable measures to help protect the information we collect from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. However, no transmission over the internet or electronic storage can be completely secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any data.

RESIDENTS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

For Residents of the State of California, the following provisions address the foundational principles of the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018.

**1\. DATA PROTECTION PRINCIPLES**  
  
The COMPANY is committed to processing data in accordance with its responsibilities under the CCPA, and in particular with regard to the principles articulated therein which affirm a right to privacy, provide California consumers should be able to exercise control over their personal information, and provide that there are safeguards against misuse of their personal information.

And, among other rights,

j. authorize the Consumer to opt out of the sale of personal information; and
