Reporting a Vulnerability about GitLab or GitLab.com
----------------------------------------------------

Please report any security vulnerabilities in GitLab itself via our [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/gitlab) bug bounty program. If you do not desire to use HackerOne our next preferred method is to have you create a confidential issue following the instructions in our [handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/security/#creating-new-security-issues). If neither of these methods work for you, feel free to email us at [security@gitlab.com](mailto:security@gitlab.com). Please note initial vulnerability reports to the security@gitlab.com email address will be redirected to HackerOne and confidential issue creation as these are the most [efficent](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#efficiency) methods of Application Security Issue Triage.

Please refrain from requesting compensation for reporting vulnerabilities. If you want we will [publicly acknowledge](https://about.gitlab.com/security/vulnerability-acknowledgements/) your responsible disclosure. We also try to make the confidential issue public after the vulnerability is announced, for an example see our [impersonation feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/15548). HackerOne also makes the bug reports [public after 30 days](https://hackerone.com/disclosure-guidelines) if neither party objects, for an example see [the report for a persistent XSS on public project page](https://hackerone.com/reports/129736).

You are not allowed to search for vulnerabilities on GitLab.com itself. GitLab is open source software, you can install a copy yourself and test against that. You can either download [CE](https://about.gitlab.com/install/), [EE](https://about.gitlab.com/downloads-ee/), or the [GitLab Development Kit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit). If you want to perform testing without setting GitLab up yourself please contact us to arrange access to a staging server.

You can find more details on how we handle [security releases here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release-tools/blob/master/doc/security.md).

On our website you can find more about [the availability and security of GitLab.com](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-com/#faq). Security issues that are not vulnerabilities can be seen on [our public issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues?label_name%5B%5D=security).

Reporting a Vulnerability in Public Projects Hosted on GitLab.com
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Please see our [CVE Request Process](https://about.gitlab.com/security/cve#requesting-a-cve-from-gitlab) to learn how to request a CVE for a public project hosted on GitLab.com.

Confidential issues
-------------------

When a vulnerability is suspected or discovered we create a [confidential ~security issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/security/#creating-new-security-issues) to track it internally. Security patches are pushed to [dev.gitlab.org](https://dev.gitlab.org/), which is not publicly accessible, and merged into the `security` branch. They should not appear on [GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/) until the security release has been announced and updated packages are available.

Details can be found under [Critical Security Releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/docs/blob/master/general/security/process.md#critical-security-releases) in `release/docs`.

Red Team Rules of Engagement
----------------------------

If you want to conduct red teaming against GitLab you will need written permission upfront. You can apply by emailing security@gitlab.com your plans and experience. You need to get a written authorization letter from our Directory of Security. While you are engaged in red teaming activities you should coordinate with the Security Team so escalation (law enforcement, etc.) can be avoided. The Security Team will notify the Infrastructure Team as well as the VP of Engineering so that awareness is maintained.

Disclosure Guidelines for Vulnerabilities in 3rd Party Software
---------------------------------------------------------------

When a security vulnerability in some 3rd party product is discovered by GitLab team members the following disclosure guideline should apply:

*   The first priority is our users.
    *   Therefore for any vulnerability discovered in a dependency of GitLab we'll make sure our users are not affected.
*   For the following disclosure process our priority is to get the reported vulnerability fixed.
*   If the 3rd party acknowledges the vulnerability and is working on a patch, we will keep vulnerability details confidential until the issue is fixed.
    *   If possible, we will verify the fix before it is being published.
    *   In special cases we might release details without a fix to make the public aware. This might, for instance, be the case when a vulnerability is being actively exploited.
*   We aim for a fix within a 90 days deadline.
    *   We will treat this as a soft deadline and help to meet the deadline when reporting.
    *   We will try to coordinate with the affected 3rd party to have a patch released before we release an advisory.
*   Resulting advisories will be published in the [disclosures repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/disclosures).
