As set out in the Privacy Policy, when you use the Service, such as inviting other users to join the Service, participating in leader boards, enabling invitations or multiplayer functionality, or displaying status messages, the personal information you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them. You are responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these instances. When playing a game that supports multiplayer functionality, other users accessing the Service from within the same game on the same Wi-Fi network, local area network or within range of Bluetooth will be able to see that you are nearby, and see your nickname and photo, or full profile if you have a friend relationship with such user. If you do not want to be visible to other users nearby, you must adjust the settings on your device by launching the Game Center app, tapping Account, tapping View Account, and sliding the Game Invites switch “off”. or on your Mac, by launching the Game Center application, tapping Account, and unchecking “Allow friends to invite you to play games”. If you list your name or other personal information in a status message, that information is public. If you choose to have your public profile set to “on”, other users of the Service can see your full profile, including your full name, your activity (such as the games you have played and when you played them), your scores, and your achievements, and you can be recommended as a friend to other users. If you choose to have your public profile set to “off”, only users with whom you have established a friend relationship can see your full profile, and you will not be recommended to others. only your nickname and photo will be visible to users who are not friends. The full name associated with your Apple ID will also be shared with those users to whom you send, or from whom you accept, a friend request, such as in the Friends list, the Friends leaderboards, and the pending friends requests lists. and we may recommend games that you have played to your friends. If you prefer not to share your full name or profile with friends, you should remove that friend by tapping the “Unfriend” button at the bottom of that friend’s screen in Game Center.
