PRIVACY

The Service is subject to Apple's Privacy Policy at [https://www.apple.com/privacy](https://www.apple.com/privacy). As set out in the Privacy Policy, when you use the Service, such as inviting other users to join the Service, participating in leader boards, enabling invitations or multiplayer functionality, or displaying status messages, the personal information you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them. You are responsible for the personal information you choose to submit. When playing a game that supports multiplayer functionality, other users accessing the Service from within the same game on the same Wi-Fi network, local area network or within range of Bluetooth will be able to see that you are nearby (unless you turn this feature off), and see your nickname and photo, or full profile if you have a friend relationship with such user. If you choose to have your public profile set to “on”, other users of the Service can see your full profile, including your full name, activity (such as the games you have played and when you played them), scores, and achievements, and you can be recommended as a friend to other users. If your public profile is set to “off”, only users with whom you have established a friend relationship can see your full profile, and you will not be recommended to others; only your nickname and photo will be visible to users who are not friends. If you send or receive a friend request, the full name associated with your Apple ID will be shared with those users to whom you send, or from whom you accept, a friend request, and Apple may recommend games that you have played to your friends.

If you wish to stop sharing information with other users and the Service, see [https://www.apple.com/support/](https://www.apple.com/support/).

Some aspects of the Service are not available to children under 13, such as features that allow users to disclose personally identifiable information. Please enable restrictions as appropriate.
