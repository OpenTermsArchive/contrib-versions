Abuse programme policies and enforcement
----------------------------------------

The content policies listed below play an important role in maintaining a positive experience for our users. We need to curb abuses that threaten our ability to provide this service, and we ask that everyone abide by the policies below to help us achieve this goal.

These policies apply to **Google Meet ('Meet')**. When applying these policies, we may make exceptions based on educational, documentary, scientific or artistic considerations or where there are other substantial benefits to the users of the service. Be sure that you check back from time to time, as these policies may change. Please also refer to [Google's Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en-US) for more information.

Report abuse

If you believe that someone is violating the policies found below, [report abuse](https://support.google.com/meet/contact/abuse).

Google may disable your ability to use Meet or disable accounts that are found to be in violation of these policies. If your service has been suspended or your account has been disabled, and you believe that it was a mistake, please follow these instructions on [this page](https://accounts.google.com/signin/v2/recoveryidentifier?fpOnly=1&hl=en&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=ServiceLogin).

Programme policies
------------------

### Child safety

Don't use Meet to create, upload or distribute content that exploits or abuses children. This includes all child sexual abuse material.

More broadly, Meet prohibits the use of our products to endanger children. This includes but isn't limited to predatory behaviour towards children such as:

*   Child grooming (for example, befriending a child online to facilitate, either online or offline, sexual contact and/or exchanging sexual imagery with that child);
*   'Sextortion' (for example, threatening or blackmailing a child by using real or alleged access to a child's intimate images);
*   Sexualisation of a minor (e.g. imagery that depicts, encourages or promotes the sexual abuse of children or the portrayal of children in a manner that could result in the sexual exploitation of children) and
*   Trafficking of a child (for example, advertising or solicitation of a child for commercial sexual exploitation).

We will take appropriate action, which may include reporting to the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, limiting access to product features and disabling accounts. If you believe that a child is in danger of or has been subject to abuse, exploitation or trafficking, contact the police immediately.

### Circumvention

Do not engage in actions intended to bypass our policies or subvert restrictions placed on your account. This includes the creation or use of multiple accounts or other methods intended to engage in behaviour that was previously prohibited.

### Dangerous and illegal activities

Don't use Meet to promote, organise or engage in illegal activities or activities that cause serious and immediate physical harm to people or animals.

### Deceptive practices, fraud and scams

Do not deceive, mislead or confuse users for financial gain or personal harm. This includes providing instructions on, recruiting for or facilitating scams and fraud. Deceptive content includes, but is not limited to, fake reviews, 'get rich quick' schemes, advance fee, romance, sweepstakes and investment scams.

### Harassment, bullying and threats

Do not harass, bully or threaten others. We also don't allow this product to be used to engage or incite others in these activities. Remember that online harassment is illegal in many places and can have serious offline consequences for both the harasser and the victim. We may take appropriate action if we are notified of threats of harm or other dangerous situations, which may include reporting you to the relevant authorities.

### Hate speech

Don't engage in hate speech. Hate speech is content that promotes or condones violence against or has the primary purpose of inciting hatred against an individual or group on the basis of their race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, age, nationality, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or any other characteristic that is associated with systemic discrimination or marginalisation.

### Impersonation and misrepresentation of identity

Do not impersonate a person or organisation or misrepresent yourself. This includes impersonating any person or organisations you don't represent; or providing misleading information about a user's/site's identity, qualifications, ownership, purpose, products, services or business.

This also includes content or accounts misrepresenting or concealing their ownership or primary purpose, such as misrepresenting or intentionally concealing your country of origin or other material details about yourself when directing content about politics, social issues or matters of public concern to users in a country other than your own. We do allow parody, satire and the use of pseudonyms or pen names – just avoid content that is likely to mislead your audience about your true identity.

### Malware and similar malicious content

Do not transmit malware or any content that harms or interferes with the operation of the networks, servers, end-user devices or other infrastructure. This includes the direct hosting, embedding or transmission of malware, viruses, destructive code or other harmful or unwanted software or similar content. This also includes content that transmits viruses, causes pop-ups, attempts to install software without the user's consent or otherwise impacts users with malicious code. See our [Safe Browsing Policies](https://safebrowsing.google.com/#policies) for more information.

### Non-consensual intimate imagery and sextortion

Do not store or distribute private nude, sexually explicit or intimate images or videos without the subject's consent. If someone has sent a private nude, sexually explicit or intimate image or video of you, please report it to us [here](https://support.google.com/blogger/answer/7540088).

Do not threaten to expose or disseminate explicit, intimate or embarrassing content of a sexual nature of another person without consent.

Do not coerce (using power, influence or pressure), encourage or solicit financial gain or other sexual content from an individual through the threat of disseminating their explicit, intimate or embarrassing content of a sexual nature.

### Personal and confidential information

Don't share or distribute other people's personal or confidential information without authorisation. ​This includes the use of sensitive information, such as US Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, credit card numbers, images of signatures and personal health documents. In most cases where this information is broadly available elsewhere on the Internet or in public records, like national ID numbers listed on a government website, we generally don't process enforcement actions.

### Phishing

Do not use this product for phishing. This includes soliciting or collecting sensitive data such as passwords, financial details and Social Security numbers.

### Regulated goods and services

​Do not sell, advertise or facilitate the sale of regulated goods and services. Regulated goods and services include alcohol, gambling, pharmaceuticals, unapproved supplements, tobacco, fireworks, weapons or health/medical devices.

### Sexually explicit content

Do not share or distribute content that contains sexually explicit material, such as nudity, graphic sex acts and pornographic content. This includes driving traffic to commercial pornography sites. We allow content for educational, documentary, scientific or artistic purposes.

### Spam

Do not spam. This may include unwanted promotional or commercial content, unwanted content that is created by an automated programme, unwanted repetitive content, nonsensical content or anything that appears to be a mass solicitation.

### System interference

Don't abuse this product and don't harm, degrade or negatively affect the operation of networks, devices or other infrastructure. This includes degrading, disabling or negatively interfering with any aspect of the product or its services.

### Violence and gore

Don't share or distribute violent or gory content involving real-life people or animals that's primarily intended to be shocking, sensational or gratuitous. This includes ultra-graphic violence, such as dismemberment or close-up footage of mutilated corpses. Graphic violence, such as content containing significant amounts of blood, may be allowed in an educational, documentary, scientific or artistic context but please be mindful to provide enough information to help people understand the context. In some cases, content may be so violent or shocking that no amount of context will allow that content to remain on our platforms. Lastly, don't encourage others to commit specific acts of violence.

### Violent organisations and movements

Terrorist organisations aren't permitted to use this product for any purpose, including recruitment. We'll also take action against meeting organisers or participants for content related to terrorism, such as promoting terrorist acts, inciting violence or celebrating terrorist attacks.
