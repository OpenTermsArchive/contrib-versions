8.3. In order to provide reliable services to Passengers, we may determine a minimum average rating and a minimum activity score that Drivers must establish and maintain. If, after a pertinent notification from us, you do not increase your average rating or activity score to minimum level within the prescribed time period, your Driver´s account will be automatically suspended either temporarily or permanently. We may reverse the suspension of your account if it is merited by any external circumstances or it is detected that the suspension was caused by a system error or false ratings.

**9\. MARKET ANALYSIS AND CAMPAIGNS**

9.1. Market Overviews: Bolt Ireland may send you via the Bolt Apps, Bolt Driver Account, SMS, e-mail or other means, market overviews, to increase its awareness of when the Passenger's needs are the highest. Please note that such market analysis are only recommendations and do not constitute any obligations for either party. As any market estimation provided is based on previous statistics, we cannot give any guarantees that the actual market situation will reflect the latter.

9.2. Campaigns promising a minimum income: We may also provide campaigns, whereby we will guarantee a minimum income if you provide Transportation Services within a specified timeframe, location or other criteria defined by Bolt Ireland. If the specified minimum income is not reached, we shall compensate the gap. The specific requirements and conditions will be sent via the Bolt Apps, Bolt Driver Account, SMS, Email or other means. We have full discretion, in deciding if, when and to who we provide such campaigns. If we have reasonable cause to suspect any fraudulent activity, we may withhold their Fare until the suspicion of fraud has been cleared.

9.3. Campaigns for Passengers: Bolt Ireland may occasionally arrange various campaigns to Passengers in order to promote the Bolt Services. If the Fare paid by the Passenger is reduced as part of such a campaign, Bolt Ireland will in most cases pay compensation equal to the monetary value of the benefit offered to the Passengers. Bolt Ireland may set-off the marketing compensation against the Bolt Fees.
