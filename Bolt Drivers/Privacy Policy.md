****Global Privacy Notice for Drivers****

At Bolt, we are focused on making cities for people. To do this, we offer a number of alternative transport solutions including ride-hailing, shared cars, e-scooters, e-bikes and food and grocery delivery. Your safety as a Driver is our priority and this includes the safety of your personal data that we process when you use the Bolt services on the “Bolt Platform” (being the technology infrastructure made available by Bolt to facilitate online intermediation of ride-hailing services, including the Bolt Driver Portal and the Bolt Driver app (“Bolt App”)).

More information about Bolt and its group companies, such as the relevant Bolt group company for your market, is set out [here](https://bolt.eu/en-ie/privacy/privacy-controller-list/?category=rides).

  

The term “you” or “your” refers to a Driver. This Notice lets you know how we promise to look after your personal data and tells you about your privacy rights and the choices and controls available to you.

  

This Notice applies to all Drivers globally who access the Bolt Platform to fulfil passenger transportation services (and other ancillary transportation services such as package delivery services), whether acting on their own behalf as an independent service provider or acting on behalf of another service provider (for example, acting on behalf of a fleet or another individual). This Notice should be read in combination with all terms and conditions, guidelines and policies that apply to your use of the Bolt services as are made available at [https://bolt.eu/legal](https://bolt.eu/legal).

  

The way we collect, use, and share your personal data may differ depending on the legal requirements of the country or region where you access or provide services through the Bolt Platform. Local laws can influence the types of personal data we process, the purposes for which we process it, the legal basis we rely on and the rights available to you. If you operate or travel across borders, please be aware that the data practices outlined in this Notice may be adapted to comply with the applicable laws of each location. In all cases, we apply safeguards to ensure compliance with relevant legal standards.

****4\. What purposes do we use your personal data for and what is our Legal Basis for Processing?**** 

The table below sets out:

* our purposes for processing your personal data; 
* our legal grounds (known as a ****'legal basis'****) under data protection law, for each purpose; and 
* the categories of personal data we use for each purpose. Learn more about what personal data these categories include in Section 3 “__Personal Data that we process about you__” above.

Here is a general explanation of each 'legal basis' that Bolt may rely on to process your personal data to help you understand the table below:

* ****Performance of a Contract:**** When it is necessary for Bolt (or a third party) to process personal data to provide services under our Bolt Platform terms. Where the legal basis for processing personal data is performance of a contract, and you choose not to provide the information, you may be unable to benefit from the applicable Bolt's services.
* ****Legitimate Interests:**** When we process your personal data based on legitimate interest grounds. This includes our commercial and non-commercial interests in providing an innovative, personalised and safe service to you, other Drivers, and other third parties (including Passengers). Where the table below states that we rely on legitimate interests, we have provided a brief description of the legitimate interest. If you would like more information about this (including the balancing test), please contact us using the methods set out in Section 2 “__How can you contact us?__” above. In countries where legitimate interest is not an available lawful basis for Bolt’s processing activities, we will instead rely on an alternative valid legal basis.
* ****Consent:**** When we ask you to actively indicate your agreement to our use of your personal data for a certain purpose, which you have been informed of. ​​Where we rely on consent to process your personal data, you can withdraw your consent to such activities at any time. Withdrawal of the consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing that took place prior to you giving your consent to us. 
* ****Compliance with Legal Obligations:**** When we must process your personal data to comply with laws or regulations in the markets we operate in, such as to comply with our licensing conditions and obligations under tax and accounting laws. Where the legal basis for processing your personal data is compliance with legal obligations, and you choose not to provide the information, you may be unable to use the Bolt services.
* ****Vital Interests****: When we process your personal data where it is necessary to protect your vital interests or those of others, for example, in the event of an emergency or an imminent threat to life.

| ****To authenticate your account and verify your identity****<br><br>We collect information to verify who you say you are and in certain circumstances to verify your age and eligibility for a Bolt account, when required by local law. If we ask you to verify your identity (either upon registration, periodically or as a result of unusual activity being detected on your Bolt account) and you are not able to verify your identity, the Bolt services will be suspended to prevent harmful activities (including fraudulent activities) until the verification process is completed. As part of the verification process, you may be asked to submit a selfie and/or ID document to prove your identity.<br><br>To verify your identity quickly and securely, we may use facial recognition technology to confirm that your selfie shows a clear face and matches the face on your identity document. This involves processing your facial measurements. <br><br>Your biometric data may be shared with trusted verification providers to confirm your identity. If you prefer not to use facial recognition technology, you can opt for your identity to be manually verified by a member of our team, though this may take longer. You can withdraw consent at any time by contacting our Customer Support Team. | * __Performance of a Contract__ <br>* __Compliance with Legal Obligations__<br>* __Legitimate Interests__ - It is in our interest and in the interest of our Passengers to prevent and address unauthorised uses of Bolt accounts and violations of our Terms and Conditions which increases Passengers’ safety.<br>* __Consent__ \- Your opt-in consent will be required for us to proceed with biometric verification checks. | * Account Data<br>* Profile Data<br>* Identification/<br><br>Verification Data <br><br>* Device Data<br>* Geolocation Data <br>* App and Platform Usage Data<br>* Consent Data<br>* Order Data |
| ****To enable, improve and customise the transportation services and other services and features like delivery of packages, by connecting Passengers requesting Bolt services with Drivers**** <br><br>We use automated processes to ensure that Drivers and Passengers are connected quickly and efficiently. These processes are triggered when a Passenger requests a ride, and we evaluate certain data to determine appropriate trip(s), optimize trip matching, and improve the overall experience on the Bolt Platform, including:<br><br>* To match available Drivers with Passengers, we process Geolocation Data and Order Data to determine the most suitable Driver for each trip. This includes considering estimated arrival times, geographic proximity to Passengers and historical activity. <br>* Drivers can set certain preferences, such as preferred destinations, preferred radius or service categories (e.g., larger vehicles or pet-friendly rides). Orders outside the set criteria may be deprioritized by Bolt or presented as optional.<br>* If a Driver cancels or rejects an order, or if a Passenger cancels, we may prevent immediate re-matching between the same Driver and Passenger for a short period to improve efficiency and reduce repeated cancellations.<br>* We monitor order acceptance and completion patterns to provide contextual feedback to Drivers. This includes insights on ratings, cancellations, and customer support interactions to help improve service quality.<br><br>We are continually developing and improving our processes for connecting Drivers with Passengers, and may consider different factors depending on the location in which you are using Bolt’s services.<br><br>During (and for a defined period after) an active order, we also connect Drivers and Passengers through Bolt’s in-app call and messaging system. | * __Performance of a Contract__ <br>* __Legitimate Interests__ - It is in our interest and in the interest of our Passengers and Drivers to ensure that Passengers and Drivers are connected effectively, and that other services and features are provided in an efficient and user-friendly manner. | * Account Data<br>* Profile Data<br>* Geolocation Data<br>* Fleet Driver Data <br>* Vehicle Data<br>* Order Data <br>* Communication Data<br>* Driver Rating Data<br>* User Generated Data <br>* Billing and Earnings Data |
| ****To process and verify Driver registrations and compliance documentation****<br><br>We process certain data to facilitate the registration and compliance verification process for Drivers, Fleet Owners and Fleet Companies, and vehicle registrations:<br><br>* When a Driver submits a registration form, the provided Profile Data and Identification / Verification Data (including uploaded documents) are automatically processed through our internal verification platform.<br>* Documents undergo initial verification (including by automated means). If all required documents pass the checks, compliance rules are applied to ensure regulatory and platform requirements are met.<br>* Uploaded documents may be automatically processed to determine compliance with platform and regulatory requirements. If a document meets the necessary criteria, it is automatically approved. If it does not pass automated checks, it is sent for manual review, but no documents are automatically declined.<br>* If certain documentation fails verification, access to the Bolt services may be suspended until the verification process is completed. | * __Performance of a Contract__ <br>* __Legitimate Interests –__ It is in our interest, and in the interest of our Drivers and Fleet Owners, to streamline the registration process, ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, and facilitate faster activation.<br>* __Compliance with Legal Obligations__ | * Account Data<br>* Driver Compliance Data<br>* Profile Data<br>* Identification / Verification Data<br>* Background Check Data |
| ****To make sure your ride is the quickest and the most convenient and smooth for everyone**** <br><br>We collect Geolocation Data and data on the routes taken during the trip to analyse geographic coverage. This lets us improve recommendations to Drivers about the most efficient routes and facilitate the trip in the best possible way. | * __Legitimate Interests -__ It is in our interests and in the interests of our Drivers to facilitate the most convenient trip__.__ | * Account Data<br>* Geolocation Data<br>* Order Data |
| ****To calculate prices and process payments****<br><br>We use automated processes to calculate the prices of the trips. These processes are triggered when a Passenger requests a ride, and they evaluate certain data including pickup and drop-off locations, estimated distance, trip duration, and demand conditions to determine both estimated and final trip fees. <br><br>These fees may be influenced and adjusted based on various factors, including:<br><br>* Where applicable, drivers may set a preferred per-kilometer rate within the parameters set by the Bolt App. If an order’s calculated price falls below the Driver’s set rate, the trip will not be offered to that Driver. Minimum and maximum price limits per kilometer apply, varying by city.<br>* We may apply multipliers to an estimated trip fee to reflect market conditions and to optimize trip matching. For example, fees may increase where Passenger demand is significantly higher than available Drivers, or to compensate Drivers during low-demand times (e.g. fewer orders per hour). Alternatively, Bolt's commission may be adjusted dynamically to increase the appeal of a low-demand trip to Drivers.<br><br>We are continually developing and improving our processes for calculating prices, and may consider different factors depending on the location in which you are using Bolt’s services.<br><br>Additionally, we process Payment Data to facilitate Passenger payments on behalf of Drivers and Profile Data to process Driver payouts. We also use your Billing and Earnings Data to generate financial documents such as invoices, balance reports and tax reports. | * __Performance of a Contract__ <br>* __Legitimate Interests -__ It is in our interests and in the interests of our Drivers to ensure that payouts are processed efficiently, as well as to ensure fair pricing, optimize Driver earnings, and make ride matching more efficient. | * Account Data<br>* Payment Data<br>* Billing and Earnings Data<br>* Geolocation Data<br>* Order Data<br>* App and Platform Usage Data<br>* Profile Data<br>* Driver Rating Data |
| ****To facilitate additional services and programs with third parties**** <br><br>We will use Order Data and App and Platform Usage Data, where applicable, to confirm if a Driver is eligible to incentive programs and to give Bolt points or equivalents to the Drivers.<br><br>Partners can also have visibility of Drivers' data (depending on the specific partner, the data can include name, email address, referral code, phone number, information on the Driver’s tier, photograph and licence plate number) when they want to redeem specific benefits. <br><br>We also process certain data to determine your eligibility for discounts facilitated by third parties. | * __Performance of a Contrac__t <br>* __Legitimate Interests -__ It is in our interests and in the interests of our Drivers to facilitate participation in the Bolt Rewards program and receive benefits. | * Account Data<br>* Order Data<br>* App and Platform Usage Data <br>* Driver Rating Data<br>* Payment Data<br>* Profile Data<br>* Fleet Driver Data<br>* Vehicle Data |
| ****To connect Drivers with Fleet Partners through Bolt Vehicle Marketplace****<br><br>We process your data to facilitate connections between drivers and Fleet Partners via Bolt Vehicle Marketplace, a feature that allows Fleet Partners to list available vehicles for the Drivers to connect with them directly.<br><br>As part of this process, we facilitate Fleet Partners to ask drivers for information, such as age, gender, home address, experience in ride-hailing, and expected working hours.

****6\. Does Bolt transfer your personal data to other countries?****

We operate internationally and as a result, your personal data may be transferred to, stored and/or processed by Bolt Group Companies, subcontractors and partners when undertaking the activities described in this Notice outside the country where you are located. Please see our Bolt Group Companies table for details of the countries where your personal data may be transferred to within the Bolt Group. 

When we transfer your personal data outside of a country or region, such as the European Economic Area (“EEA”), we will make sure that we take steps necessary to comply with applicable legal requirements and rely on the following transfer mechanisms: 

* ****Adequacy Decisions****: We will rely on decisions from the European Commission where they recognise that certain countries and territories outside of the European Economic Area ensure an adequate level of protection for personal information. Please click [here ↗](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en) to see the list of countries deemed ‘adequate’ by the European Commission and click [here ↗](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-approach-to-international-data-transfers/international-data-transfers-building-trust-delivering-growth-and-firing-up-innovation) to see the list of countries deemed ‘adequate’ by the UK Government. We rely on these adequacy decisions when we transfer personal data we collect from the EEA and the United Kingdom to the United States (where some of our third party service providers are based).
* ****Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs):**** We will utilise standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission for transfers outside the EEA and by the UK Government for transfers outside of the United Kingdom. Please click [here ↗](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en) to see the EEA SCCs and click [here ↗](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/international-transfers/international-data-transfer-agreement-and-guidance/) to see the UK SCCs. We will rely on SCCs when we transfer personal data we collect from the EEA and the United Kingdom to the United States, Singapore and Nigeria where some of our third party service providers are based. 

  

There may be certain situations (such as responding to law enforcement requests - see Section 4 “__What purposes do we use your personal data for and what is our legal basis for processing?__” above) where a transfer of personal data will take place on the basis of exemptions provided for under applicable data protection legislation. In these circumstances, we will take steps to minimise and protect the personal data transferred.   

  

****7\. How do we keep your personal data safe?****

The security of your personal data is very important to us, and we have implemented appropriate technical and organisational controls to protect your personal data against unauthorised processing and against accidental loss, damage or destruction. We have implemented data encryption in transit and at rest, data privacy and security training, information security policies and controls around the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our data/systems. 

Any personal data collected in the course of providing Bolt Services is transferred to and stored in our data centres which are located within the EEA. Only authorised employees of ​Bolt group companies and partners ​have access to the personal data and they may access the data only for the purpose of resolving issues associated with the use of the services (including disputes regarding transportation services and customer support services in the respective countries  [https://bolt.eu/cities/](https://bolt.eu/cities/)).

For our research and scientific purposes, all data, like bulk Geolocation Data, is anonymised so you can never be identified from it. Regarding anonymised data, we will not attempt to re-identify your personal data that has been deidentified, in the course of sharing your data with other organisations.

****10\. How do we use your personal data for direct marketing?****

Please be aware that you may from time to time receive updates about special offers and promotions related to our services. We send these communications based on our legitimate interests (soft opt-in) in providing you with information about opportunities that could be beneficial to you. In countries where soft opt-in is not an available lawful basis for Bolt’s processing activities, we will instead rely on an alternative valid legal basis. You have complete control over these communications, and if you decide at any time that you do not wish to receive them, you can stop them by clicking the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of our emails, typing “STOP” for messages and SMS, or updating your communication preferences in your account settings.

Additionally, we may seek your opt-in consent for specific direct marketing activities where this is required by law. For example, we might request your consent to send you information regarding third-party promotions and offers that we think might be of interest to you. You always have the ability to opt out by changing your communication preferences in your account settings. We also personalise direct marketing messages using information about how you use the Bolt services (for example, how often you use the Bolt App).

  

****11\. How do we notify you of changes to this Notice?****

We may make changes to this Notice from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify you (as required) via the Bolt App, website or via another method such as email.
