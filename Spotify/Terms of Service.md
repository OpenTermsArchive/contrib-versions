[](#1-introduction)**1\. Introduction**
---------------------------------------

Please read these Terms of Use ("**Terms**") carefully as they govern your use of (which includes access to) Spotify's personalized services for streaming music and other content, including all of our websites and software applications that incorporate or link to these Terms (collectively, the "**Spotify Service**") and any music, videos, podcasts, audiobooks, or other material that is made available through the Spotify Service ("**Content**").

Use of the Spotify Service is subject to additional terms and conditions presented by Spotify, all of which are made part of these Terms by this reference (collectively, the "**Agreements**"). Please refer to Section 7 below for information about those additional terms and how we may change these Terms or the additional terms incorporated by reference. To learn more about how Spotify collects, uses, shares and protects your personal data, please see the [Spotify Privacy Policy](https://www.spotify.com/legal/privacy-policy/).

By signing up for, or otherwise using, the Spotify Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, then you must not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.

THESE TERMS CONTAIN A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT, AS FURTHER SET FORTH IN SECTION 6 BELOW, REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR ANY OTHER COURT PROCEEDINGS, OR CLASS ACTIONS OF ANY KIND. IN ARBITRATION THERE IS LESS DISCOVERY AND APPELLATE REVIEW THAN IN COURT.

### [](#service-provider)**Service provider**

These Terms are between you and Spotify USA Inc., 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, NY, 10007.

### [](#age-and-eligibility-requirements)**Age and eligibility requirements**

BY USING THE SPOTIFY SERVICE, YOU AFFIRM THAT YOU ARE 18 YEARS OR OLDER TO ENTER INTO THESE TERMS, OR, IF YOU ARE NOT, THAT YOU ARE 13 YEARS OR OLDER AND HAVE OBTAINED PARENTAL OR GUARDIAN CONSENT TO ENTER INTO THESE TERMS. Additionally, in order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you represent that: you reside in the United States, and any registration and account information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times. If you do not meet the minimum age requirements then you must not register as a user. In certain markets, Spotify may offer primary account holders the opportunity to allow access to a kids experience as part of a family subscription. By enabling such access, the primary account holder confirms they are the legal guardian of any user accessing the experience and that they give permission for the younger user to use Spotify.

[](#2-the-spotify-service-provided-by-us)**2\. The Spotify Service Provided by Us**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [](#spotify-service-options)**Spotify Service options**

We provide numerous Spotify Service options. Certain Spotify Service options are provided free of charge, while other options require payment before they can be accessed ("**Paid Subscriptions**"). We may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services. We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.

### [](#trials)**Trials**

From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate ("**Trial**"). By using a Spotify Service via a Trial, you agree to the [Spotify Paid Subscription Terms](https://www.spotify.com/us/legal/paid-subscription-terms/).

### [](#third-party-applications-devices-and-open-source-software)**Third-party applications, devices and open source software**

The Spotify Service may be integrated with, or may otherwise interact with, third-party applications, websites, and services ("**Third-Party Applications**") and third-party personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers, and other devices ("**Devices**"). Your use of such Third-Party Applications and Devices may be subject to additional terms, conditions, and policies provided to you by the applicable third party. Spotify does not guarantee that Third-Party Applications and Devices will be compatible with the Spotify Service.

### [](#service-limitations-and-modifications)**Service limitations and modifications**

We use reasonable efforts to keep the Spotify Service operational and to provide you with a personalized, immersive audio experience. However, Spotify reserves the right to change our Spotify Service offerings and their availability from time to time, without notice or liability to you. For example:

* The Spotify Service may experience temporary interruptions due to technical difficulties, maintenance or testing, or updates, including those required to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements.

* Our dynamic content offering is constantly evolving and adapting to the needs of the Spotify community. Spotify has no obligation to provide any specific content through the Spotify Service, and Spotify or the applicable owners may remove access to particular songs, videos, podcasts, audiobooks and other Content without notice.

Your right to terminate these Terms if you no longer want to use the Spotify Service is set forth in Section 6 below.

If you have prepaid fees directly to Spotify for a Paid Subscription that Spotify permanently discontinues prior to the end of your Prepaid Period (as that term is defined in the "Payments and cancellations" section below), Spotify will refund you the prorated portion of the prepaid fees for the Pre-Paid Period after such discontinuation. Your account and billing information must be up to date in order for us to refund you.

Spotify has no liability to you, nor any obligation to provide a refund to you, in connection with internet or other Spotify Service outages or failures that are caused by the actions of government authorities, other third parties, or events beyond our control.

### [](#payments-and-cancellation)**Payments and cancellation**

**Paid Subscriptions**

You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by:

* paying a subscription fee plus applicable taxes in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase; or
* prepayment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period ("**Prepaid Period**").

Tax rates are calculated based on the information you provide and the applicable rate at the time of your monthly charge.

If you purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party, separate terms and conditions with such third party may apply to your use of the Spotify Service in addition to these Terms. Please contact the third party regarding any refunds or to manage your subscription. If you purchase a Paid Subscription using a code, gift card, pre-paid offer, or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription ("**Codes**"), you must agree to the Spotify [Card Terms](https://www.spotify.com/legal/gift-card/).

If you purchase Audiobook Content outside of your Paid Subscription, your purchase will be governed by the [Audiobook Purchase Terms and Conditions](https://www.spotify.com/us/legal/audiobook-purchase-terms/).

**Price and tax changes**

Spotify may from time to time make changes to Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Prepaid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, and will communicate any price changes to you in advance. Price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change and, by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect, you will have accepted the new price. If you do not agree to a price change, you can reject the change by unsubscribing from the applicable Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.

Tax rates are based on the rates applicable at the time of your monthly charge. These amounts can change over time with local tax requirements in your country, state, territory, county, or city. Any change in tax rate will be automatically applied based on the account information you provide.

The price of a Paid Subscription or Trial is specific to the version of the Spotify Service offered in your country of residence and you agree not to engage in any means to Access the Paid Subscription or Trial without paying the applicable price or to frustrate Spotify's legitimate attempts to collect payment for such Access.

**Billing and cancellation**

Unless otherwise indicated (for example, if you have signed up for a Prepaid Period), Paid Subscriptions continue indefinitely until cancelled. You will be billed on a recurring basis on the first day of each billing period and you will pay and you authorise us (or the applicable third party, if you sign up through a third party) to charge your payment method the then-current subscription fee.

You may cancel your Paid Subscription at any time by logging into your Spotify account and following the prompts on the Account page or by clicking [here](https://support.spotify.com/article/cancel-premium/?_gl=1*2y9g6z*_gcl_au*MTkyNDM5MjI3My4xNzAxNzEwMzMz) and following the instructions. Unless otherwise indicated, cancellation will take effect from the end of the billing period in which you cancel and you will be downgraded to the free version of the Spotify Service. Unless otherwise required by law, we do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods, except as expressly stated in these Terms.

If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated with your Code, or when there is an insufficient prepaid balance to pay for the Spotify Service.

In addition to, and notwithstanding, any other rights we may have under these Terms, we reserve the right to terminate a Paid Subscription at any time, on no less than 14 days' notice to you.

Subject to the exceptions set forth in the "Exceptions to arbitration" section below, you and Spotify agree that any Dispute between you and Spotify (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms) will be determined by binding individual (not class) arbitration.

The arbitrator can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorneys' fees and costs where allowable under applicable law), except that (as discussed below) the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. This arbitration provision will survive termination of these Terms.

#### [](#exceptions-to-arbitration)**Exceptions to arbitration**

You and Spotify both agree that any Dispute relating to any actual or alleged infringement of your or Spotify's intellectual property rights shall be brought in the federal courts of New York, New York, and that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of your or Spotify's rights, at any time, to elect to have an individual action heard in: (1) a U.S. small claims court (so long as the action is litigated exclusively in small claims court and is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction); or (2) a court of law, in accordance with the jurisdiction and venue described in the "Governing law, jurisdiction, and jury trial waiver" section above, seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator. In addition, this Arbitration Agreement does not stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa). Nor does this Arbitration Agreement preclude you or us from entering into or participating in a class-wide, collective, or representative settlement of claims.

#### [](#no-class-or-representative-proceedings-and-class-action-waiver)**No class or representative proceedings and class action waiver**

YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER IN ARBITRATION OR LITIGATION ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, CONSOLIDATED, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Unless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person's claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief) and all appeals have been exhausted or the decision is otherwise final, then the parties agree that such a claim or request for relief shall be decided by a court only after all other claims and requests for relief are arbitrated.

#### [](#pre-arbitration-notice-of-dispute-and-informal-resolution-period)**Pre-arbitration notice of dispute and informal resolution period**

A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the Dispute ("**Notice**") to the other. Notices to Spotify must be sent by email to tounotice@spotify.com, and Notices to you must be sent to the email address associated with your Spotify account. All Notices must: (1) be personally signed by the party sending the Notice; (2) provide the relevant user's name, email address associated with the user's Spotify account, and Spotify username; (3) provide the claimant's address of residence (and if different, mailing address); (4) describe with specificity the nature and basis of the Dispute; and (5) set forth the alleged damage and harm suffered and the specific relief sought with a calculation for it.

After a Notice containing all of the information required above is received, the parties agree to engage in good faith for a period of sixty (60) days in an effort to resolve the Dispute (this time period may be extended by agreement of the parties) ("**Informal Resolution Period**"). The party receiving the Notice may request a telephone or video settlement conference during the Informal Resolution Period in an effort to facilitate resolution of the Dispute ("**Informal Settlement Conference**"). The Informal Settlement Conference, if any, will take place at a mutually agreeable time, which can be after the sixty (60) day Informal Resolution Period if needed to accommodate the parties' schedules. During the Informal Settlement Conference, you and a Spotify representative must both personally participate in a good-faith effort to resolve the Dispute without the need to proceed with arbitration. Any counsel representing the parties also may participate. Personal participation in an Informal Settlement Conference will not be required if both you and Spotify agree in writing.

The Notice, Informal Resolution Period, and Informal Settlement Conference are intended to give the parties a meaningful opportunity to resolve Disputes informally. If any aspect of this "Pre-arbitration notice of dispute and informal resolution period" section has not been met, the parties agree that a court can enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration and, unless prohibited by law, the arbitration administrator shall not accept or administer an arbitration nor demand fees in connection with such an arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party retains the right to raise non-compliance with the requirements of this section and seek appropriate relief in arbitration, if neither party wishes to bring the issue to a court.

Any applicable statute of limitations or contractual limitations period will be tolled for any claims and requests for relief set forth in a Notice from the date that either you or Spotify sends the other a fully complete Notice until: (1) thirty (30) days after completion of the Informal Resolution Period, if no Informal Settlement Conference is held; or (2) thirty (30) days after completion of the Informal Settlement Conference if an Informal Settlement Conference is held ("**Tolling Period**").

Neither you nor Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding until after the Tolling Period has ended.

### [](#arbitration-rules-and-fees)**Arbitration rules and fees**

Either you or Spotify may start arbitration proceedings. Any arbitration between you and Spotify will be administered by National Arbitration and Mediation ("**NAM**") in accordance with their rules applicable to the nature of the Dispute, including the Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or the Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings ("**NAM Rules**"), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. You and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement (despite the choice of law provision above). The NAM Rules, as well as instructions on how to file a demand for arbitration ("**Demand**") with NAM, appear at [www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/](http://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/). The Demand must attach the relevant Notice and be personally signed by the party initiating the arbitration (and their counsel, if represented).

If NAM is unavailable, unwilling, or otherwise unable to administer an arbitration in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement, then another administrator that will do so will be selected by agreement of the parties. If the parties cannot agree, then they will jointly petition a court to appoint an administrator that will do so. To start an arbitration, the claimant shall send a copy of the Demand to NAM and the other party. If you initiate arbitration, you shall serve the Demand on Spotify via email at tounotice@spotify.com and to Spotify's registered agent at CT Corporation System, 28 Liberty Street, New York, New York, 10005. If Spotify initiates arbitration, Spotify shall serve the Demand on you at the email address associated with your Spotify account. The claimant must certify in the Demand that the requirements set forth in the "Pre-arbitration notice of dispute and informal resolution period" section above have been met, and must attach a copy of the Notice to the Demand.

Each party retains the right to request a hearing in arbitration from the arbitrator. Any arbitration hearings will be conducted by phone or videoconference to the extent possible, but if the arbitrator determines that a hearing should be conducted in person, the locale for such hearing shall be in the county or parish where you reside or at another agreed upon locale.

As in court, any counsel participating in an arbitration certifies that they are complying with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), including a certification that the claim or the relief sought is neither frivolous nor brought for an improper purpose. The arbitrator is authorized to impose any sanctions available under the NAM Rules, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, or applicable federal or state law against all appropriate represented parties and counsel.

Spotify will pay all filing, administration, case-management, hearing, and arbitrator fees ("**Arbitration Fees**") if it initiates an arbitration. If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding, the allocation and payment of Arbitration Fees will be governed by the NAM Rules, unless a different allocation is required by court order or for this Arbitration Agreement to be enforced. You and Spotify agree that arbitration should be cost effective for all parties. Either party may engage with the arbitration administrator around fee reductions and deferred payments.

Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may consider rulings in other arbitrations involving different users, but an arbitrator's ruling will not be binding in any proceeding involving different users. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve any disagreements as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits. An arbitration award that has been satisfied may not be filed or entered in court.

### [](#mass-arbitration)**Mass arbitration**

If you elect to have your claim addressed as part of a mass arbitration (defined below), you agree to the additional procedures set forth below.

If twenty-five (25) or more claimants submit Notices or attempt to file Demands raising similar claims, are represented by the same or coordinated counsel (regardless of whether the Notices or Demands are submitted simultaneously), and the parties cannot resolve the cases during the Informal Resolution Period, all of the cases must be resolved in arbitration through staged sets of proceedings. You agree to this process even though it may delay the arbitration of your case.

These mass filing procedures are intended to facilitate the efficient and orderly resolution and settlement of mass arbitrations. If any aspect of this "Mass arbitration" section has not been met, the parties agree that a court can enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations inconsistent with this section and, unless prohibited by law, the arbitration administrator shall not accept or administer an arbitration, nor will the administrator demand fees in connection with such arbitrations, until such issues are finally resolved. Similarly, any claimants who dispute whether their claims are part of a mass arbitration or are otherwise subject to the requirements of this section may ask a court to resolve that dispute. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if neither party wishes to bring the issue to a court, both parties retain the right to raise issues regarding compliance with or applicability of the requirements of this section and seek appropriate relief in arbitration, including from a process arbitrator.

If these mass filing procedures apply to your case, the Tolling Period for your claims will be extended until your case is selected to proceed as part of a staged proceeding, withdrawn, opted out of arbitration (as set forth below), or otherwise resolved.

First Stage: In the first stage, counsel for the parties shall each select twenty-five (25) cases per side (50 cases total) to be filed in arbitration and to proceed individually in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement, with each case assigned to a separate and different arbitrator (unless the parties agree otherwise). In the meantime, any remaining cases shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any Arbitration Fees be assessed in connection with those cases unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After the first stage is completed, the parties shall engage in a global, non-binding, and confidential mediation of all remaining cases with a retired federal or state court judge, and Spotify shall pay the mediator's fee.

Second Stage: If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining cases after the mediation, the parties shall repeat the same process except that fifty (50) cases shall be selected per side (100 cases total) to proceed individually in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement, with each case assigned to a separate and different arbitrator (unless the parties agree otherwise). After the second stage is completed, the parties will again engage in a global, non-binding, and confidential mediation of all remaining cases with a retired federal or state court judge, with the mediator's fee paid for by Spotify.

If the parties are unable to resolve any remaining cases after a second global mediation session:

Option One: You may opt out of arbitration and elect to have your case heard in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with these Terms. You may opt out of arbitration by providing an individual, personally signed notice of your intention to opt out of arbitration to Spotify via email at tounotice@spotify.com within thirty (30) days after the conclusion of the second global mediation session. Counsel for the parties may agree to adjust these deadlines.

OR

Option Two: If neither you nor Spotify elects to have your case heard in court consistent with Option One, then you agree that your case will be resolved through continuing staged proceedings as set forth below. Assuming the number of remaining cases exceeds two hundred (200), then two hundred (200) cases shall be randomly selected (or selected through a process agreed to by counsel for the parties) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. The parties shall meet and confer regarding ways to increase the efficiency of the process, including whether to allow more than two hundred (200) cases to be brought at a time. If the number of remaining cases is fewer than two hundred (200), then all of those cases shall be filed and proceed in individual arbitrations. No more than five (5) cases within any set of two hundred (200) cases may be assigned to the same arbitrator to proceed individually, unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining cases shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those cases unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process.

Throughout the staged process above, the arbitrators for the cases are encouraged to resolve the cases within one hundred twenty (120) days of appointment or as swiftly as possible thereafter, consistent with fairness to the parties. If any case selected for a staged set of proceedings is withdrawn prior to the arbitrator's award (and without the consent of the other party), another case shall be selected to proceed individually in arbitration consistent with the process set forth above.

A court of competent jurisdiction will have the authority to enforce this "Mass arbitration" section and, if necessary, to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations or the assessment or collection of Arbitration Fees. This "Mass arbitration" section is intended to be severable from the rest of this Arbitration Agreement. If a court decides that the staging process set forth in this "Mass arbitration" section is not enforceable (and after exhaustion of all appeals), then all cases may be filed in arbitration, but the payment of Arbitration Fees will be assessed as the arbitrations advance and arbitrators are appointed, rather than when the arbitrations are initiated.

### [](#enforceability)**Enforceability**

If in the process of arbitrating or litigating a Dispute this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole, the parties agree that they may seek to resolve the Dispute in a U.S. small claims court or in the federal or state courts of New York, New York, consistent with the "Governing law, jurisdiction, and jury trial waiver" section above. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each party may bring a Dispute against the other party only in an individual capacity and not participate as a plaintiff, claimant, or class member in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may participate in a class-wide settlement.

[](#7-about-these-terms)**7\. About These Terms**
-------------------------------------------------

Under applicable law, you may have certain rights that can't be limited by a contract. These Terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.

### [](#changes)**Changes**

We may make changes to these Terms (including any additional Spotify terms and conditions incorporated by reference herein) from time to time by notifying you of such changes by any reasonable means, including by posting the revised Terms on the applicable Spotify Service (provided that, for material changes, we will seek to supplement such notice by email, an in-service pop-up message, or other prominent notice within the Spotify Service, or other means). Your use of the Spotify Service following any changes to these Terms will constitute your acceptance of such changes. Premium Subscribers who do not wish to continue using the Spotify Service under the updated Terms must close their Spotify account prior to their renewal date or thirty (30) days after the Effective Date, whichever occurs first. If Spotify makes any material change to the Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the notice address), you may reject any such change by sending us a personally signed, written notice of your decision to opt out of those changes via email to tounotice@spotify.com. This opt-out notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of when we notify users of the change and include: (1) your name, address, email address associated with your Spotify account, phone number, and Spotify username. Such an opt-out must be sent by you personally from your personal email address, and not by your agent, attorney, or anyone else purporting to act on your behalf. The opt-out notice also must include a statement that you wish to reject the change to the Arbitration Agreement. Opting out of a material change to the Arbitration Agreement is not an opt-out of arbitration altogether. Even if you opt out of a material change to the Arbitration Agreement, you and Spotify agree that any Dispute will be determined by binding individual (not class) arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Agreement in effect immediately before any such opt-out.

### [](#entire-agreement)**Entire agreement**

### [](#severability-and-waiver)**Severability and waiver**

Unless as otherwise stated in these Terms, should any provision of these Terms be held invalid or unenforceable for any reason or to any extent, the remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected, and the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.

Any failure by Spotify or any third-party beneficiary to enforce these Terms or any provision thereof shall not waive Spotify's or the applicable third-party beneficiary's right to do so.

### [](#assignment)**Assignment**

Spotify may assign any or all of these Terms, and may assign or delegate, in whole or in part, any of its rights or obligations under these Terms. You may not assign these Terms, in whole or in part, nor transfer or sublicense your rights under these Terms to any third party.
