[1\. About this Policy](#1-about-this-policy)
---------------------------------------------

This Policy describes how we process your personal data at Spotify USA Inc.

It applies to your use of:

*   all Spotify streaming services as a user. This includes use of these services under our free or paid options (each a "Service Option"); and
*   other Spotify services which include a link to this Privacy Policy (e.g. Spotify websites, Customer Support and the Community Site).

From now on, we'll collectively call these the "**Spotify Service**".

From time to time, we may develop new or offer additional services. They'll also be subject to this Policy, unless stated otherwise when we introduce them.

**This Policy is _not..._**

*   the Spotify [Terms of Use](https://www.spotify.com/legal/end-user-agreement/). That's a separate document, outlining the legal contract between you and Spotify for using the Spotify Service. It also describes the rules of Spotify and your user rights.
*   about your use of other Spotify services which have their own dedicated privacy policy, such as Anchor, Soundtrap, Megaphone and Greenroom.

We have included further information about rights and disclosures as required under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in our [California Privacy Disclosures](http://spotify.com/us/legal/California-privacy-disclosure) supplement.

[5\. Sharing your personal data](#5-sharing-your-personal-data)
---------------------------------------------------------------

This section sets out the categories of recipients of the personal data collected or generated through your use of the Spotify Service.

**Publicly available information**

The following personal data will always be publicly available on the Spotify Service:

*   Your profile name
*   Your profile photo
*   Your public playlists
*   Who you follow on the Spotify Service
*   Who follows you on the Spotify Service (you can remove followers)

**Personal data you may choose to share**

We will only share the following personal data with those outlined in the table below:

*   where sharing of particular personal data is needed for the use of a Spotify Service feature, or a third party application, service or device, which you have chosen to use; or
*   if you otherwise grant us your permission to share the personal data, e.g. by selecting the appropriate setting in the Spotify Service or by giving your consent

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Categories of recipient** | **Reason for sharing** |
| Third party applications, services and devices you connect to your Spotify Account | To connect your Spotify account, and/or allow you to use the Spotify Service in connection with third party applications, services or devices.  <br>Examples of such third party applications, services and devices include: social media applications, speaker devices, televisions, automotive platforms, or voice assistants, which interact with the Spotify Service.  <br>You can see and remove many third party connections under “Apps” in your account. |
| Support community | To enable you to use the Spotify Support Community service.  <br>When you register for an account on the Spotify Support Community, we’ll ask you to create a specific profile name. This will be publicly displayed to anyone who uses the Spotify Support Community. We’ll also display any questions or comments you post. |
| Other Spotify users | To share information about your use of the Spotify Service with other Spotify users, including your ‘Spotify Followers’.  <br>For example, under “Social” settings you can choose whether to share your recently played artists and your playlists on your profile. |
| Artists and record labels | To receive news or promotional offers directly from artists, record labels or other partners.  <br>You may choose to share personal data (for example, your email address) for this purpose. You’ll always have the option to change your mind and withdraw your consent at any time. |

\*\* Information we may share\*\*

See this table for details of who we share to and why.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Categories of recipients** | **Reason for sharing** |
| Service providers | So they can provide their services to Spotify.  <br>These service providers may include those we hire to:<br><br>*   give customer support<br>*   operate the technical infrastructure we need to provide the Spotify Service<br>*   assist in protecting and securing our systems and services (e.g. Google’s reCAPTCHA)<br>*   help market Spotify’s (and our partners’) products, services, events and promotions |
| Payment processors | So they can process your payments, and for anti-fraud purposes. |
| Advertising partners | So our ad partners can help us deliver more relevant advertising to you on the Spotify Service.  <br>For example, our ad partners help us facilitate tailored advertising:<br><br>*   This is when we use third party information to tailor ads to be more relevant to you (also known as interest based advertising).<br>*   An example of a tailored ad is when an ad partner has information suggesting you like cars, which could enable us to show you ads about cars.<br>*   You can control tailored advertising in your [account privacy settings](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/) under “Tailored Ads”.<br>*   If you are “opted out” of Tailored Ads, you may still get advertising on ad-supported services (such as podcasts or the Free Service Option) based on your registration information and ads based on the content you are streaming on our Services. For example, if you are streaming a cooking podcast, you may hear an ad for a food processor or if you are streaming a workout playlist, you may hear an ad for sports clothing. |
| Marketing Partners | To promote Spotify with our partners. We share some personal data with these partners where necessary to:<br><br>*   enable you to participate in Spotify promotions, including trials or other bundled offers<br>*   to promote Spotify in media and advertising published on other online services<br>*   help us and our partners to measure the effectiveness of Spotify promotions<br><br>  <br>Examples of partners include:<br><br>*   marketing or sponsorship partners<br>*   websites and mobile apps who sell us advertising space on their services<br>*   device, app and mobile partners who also offer Spotify promotions<br><br>  <br>Our partners may also combine the personal data we share with them with other data they collect about you (e.g. your use of their services). We and our partners may use this information to present you with offers, promotions, or other marketing activities that we believe will be relevant to you. |
| Other partner sharing | We may share personal data with partners to help us understand and improve the performance of our products and partnerships.  <br>You can see and remove many partner connections under “Apps” in your account. |
| Academic researchers | For activities such as statistical analysis and academic study, but only in a pseudonymised format. Pseudonymised data is where your data is identified by a code rather than your name or other information that directly identifies you. |
| Other Spotify group companies | Where we have offices, to carry out our daily business operations and so we can maintain and provide the Spotify Service to you. |
| Law enforcement and other authorities | When we believe in good faith it’s necessary for us to do so, for example:  <br><br>*   to comply with a legal obligation<br>*   to respond to a valid legal process (such as a search warrant, court order, or subpoena)<br>*   for our own or a third party’s justifiable interest, relating to:<br>    *   national security<br>    *   law enforcement<br>    *   litigation (a court case)<br>    *   criminal investigation<br>    *   protecting someone’s safety<br>    *   preventing death or imminent bodily harm. |
| Purchasers of our business | Where we sell or negotiate to sell our business to a buyer or possible buyer.  <br>In this situation, Spotify will continue to ensure your personal data is kept confidential. We’ll give you notice before your personal data is transferred to the buyer or a different privacy policy starts to apply. |

[6\. Data retention and deletion](#6-data-retention-and-deletion)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

**Retention**

We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Spotify Service and for Spotify's legitimate and essential business purposes, such as:

*   maintaining the performance of the Spotify Service
*   making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings
*   complying with our legal obligations
*   resolving disputes

**Deletion**

If you close or request that we close your account, we'll delete or anonymise your personal data so it no longer identifies you, unless we're required to keep something or we still need to use it for a legally justifiable reason.

Here are some examples of situations where we're legally allowed or required to keep some of your personal data:

*   if there's an unresolved issue relating to your account, such as an outstanding credit or unresolved claim or dispute
*   for our legal, tax, audit and accounting obligations
*   for our legitimate business interests such as fraud prevention or to maintain security.

[7\. Transfer to other countries](#7-transfer-to-other-countries)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

When carrying out the activities described in this Policy, Spotify shares your personal data internationally with Spotify group companies, subcontractors and partners. They may process your data in countries whose data protection laws are not considered to be as strong as EU laws or the laws which apply where you live. For example, they may not give you the same rights over your data.

Whenever we transfer personal data internationally, we use tools to:

*   make sure the data transfer complies with applicable law
*   help to give your data the same level of protection as it has in the EU

We do this using a variety of protections, as appropriate for each data transfer. For example, we use:

*   [Standard Contractual Clauses](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021D0914&from=EN) (or an alternative legal tool) to require the third party to protect your data and to provide you with EU-level rights and protections
*   technical protections, such as encryption and pseudonymisation
*   policies and processes to challenge disproportionate or unlawful government authority requests

You can exercise your rights under the Standard Contractual Clauses by contacting us or the third party who processes your personal data.

[8\. Keeping your personal data safe](#8-keeping-your-personal-data-safe)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

We're committed to protecting our users' personal data. We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to help protect the security of your personal data. However, be aware that no system is ever completely secure.

We have implemented various safeguards including pseudonymisation, encryption, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorised access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems.

To protect your user account, we encourage you to:

*   use a strong password that is unique to your Spotify account
*   never share your password with anyone
*   limit access to your computer and browser
*   log out once you have finished using the Spotify Service on a shared device
*   read more detail on [protecting your account](https://support.spotify.com/article/protect-your-account/)

You can log out of Spotify in multiple places at once by using the "Sign out everywhere" function on [your account page](http://www.spotify.com/account).

If other individuals have access to your Spotify account (for example if you've given them permission to use your account on a shared device), then they can access personal data, controls and the Spotify Service available in your account.

It's your responsibility to only provide individuals with permission to use your account where you're comfortable sharing this personal data with them. Anyone else's use of your Spotify account may impact your personalised recommendations and be included in your data download.

[9\. Children](#9-children)
---------------------------

Note: This Policy doesn't apply to Spotify Kids, unless the [Spotify Kids Privacy Policy](https://www.spotify.com/legal/kids-privacy-policy/) says so. Spotify Kids is a separate Spotify application.

The Spotify Service has a minimum "Age Limit" in each country. The Spotify Service is not directed to children whose age:

*   is under the age of 13 years
*   or, makes it illegal to process their personal data
*   or, requires parental consent to process their personal data

We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the applicable Age Limit. If you're under the Age Limit, please do not use the Spotify Service, and do not provide any personal data to us. Instead, we recommend using a [Spotify Kids](http://www.spotify.com/kids) account.

If you're a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify, please contact us.

If we learn that we've collected the personal data of a child under the applicable Age Limit, we'll take reasonable steps to delete the personal data. This may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child.

When using a shared device on the main Spotify Service, you should be cautious about playing or recommending any content to individuals under 18 years old which could be inappropriate for them.

[10\. Changes to this Policy](#10-changes-to-this-policy)
---------------------------------------------------------

We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.

When we make material changes to this Policy, we'll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances. For example, we may display a prominent notice within the Spotify Service or send you an email or device notification.

[11\. How to contact us](#11-how-to-contact-us)
-----------------------------------------------
