---------------------------------------------

This Privacy Policy describes how we process your personal data at Spotify USA Inc. From now on, we'll call it the 'Policy'.

It applies to your use of:

* all Spotify streaming services as a user. For example this includes:
    * your use of Spotify on any device
    * the personalization of your user experience. Watch [our personalization explainer video](https://www.spotify.com/privacy) to learn more about this
    * the infrastructure required to provide our services
    * connection of your Spotify account with another application
    * both our free or paid streaming options (each a '**Service Option**')
* other Spotify services which include a link to this Policy. These include Spotify websites, Customer Service and the Community Site

From now on, we'll collectively call these the '**Spotify Service**'.

From time to time, we may develop new or offer additional services. They'll also be subject to this Policy, unless stated otherwise when we introduce them. In some cases, we may provide different or additional policies or notices about our information practices. For example, if you reside in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah or Virginia, our [Supplemental U.S. State Privacy Notice](https://www.spotify.com/legal/notice-at-collection/) applies in addition to this Policy.

**This Policy is _not_...**

* the Spotify [Terms of Use](https://www.spotify.com/legal/end-user-agreement/), which is a separate document. The Terms of Use outline the legal contract between you and Spotify for using the Spotify Service. It also describes the rules of Spotify and your user rights
* about your use of other Spotify services which have their own privacy policy. Other Spotify services include Anchor and Megaphone.

**Other resources and settings**

Key information about your personal data is right here in this Policy. However, you might want to take a look at our other privacy resources and controls:

* [Privacy Center](https://www.spotify.com/privacy/): A user-friendly hub with summaries of key topics and helpful videos. It includes the 'Your Privacy Controls' video which shows you how to exercise your user rights and make choices about the way we process your data. See [Section 2 'Your personal data rights and controls'](#2-your-personal-data-rights-and-controls) for more on user rights.
* [Privacy Settings](https://www.spotify.com/account/privacy/): Control the processing of certain personal data, including [tailored advertising](#tailored-advertising-controls).
* [Notification Settings](https://www.spotify.com/account/notifications/) Set which marketing communications you get from Spotify.
* Settings (found in the Desktop and Mobile versions of Spotify): Control certain aspects of the Spotify Service such as 'Social' or 'Explicit Content'. On the 'Social' setting, you can:
    * start a Private session
    * choose whether to share what you listen to on Spotify with your followers
    * choose whether to show your recently played artists on your public profile

On the 'Explicit Content' setting you can control whether explicit-rated content can be played on your Spotify account.

* [Cookies Policy](https://www.spotify.com/legal/cookies-policy/): Information on how we use cookies and how to manage your cookie preferences. Cookies are files saved on your phone, tablet or computer when you visit a website.

| **Deletion** | **Request that we delete certain of your personal data.**<br><br>  <br><br>Please note there are situations where Spotify is unable to delete your data, for example when:<br><br>  <br><br>* it’s still necessary to process the data for the purpose we collected it for<br>* we have an overriding interest in continuing to process the data, for example where we need the data to protect our services from fraud<br>* Spotify has a legal obligation to keep the data, or<br>* Spotify needs the data to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. For example, if there’s an unresolved issue relating to your account | There are several ways you can delete personal data from Spotify:<br><br>  <br><br>* to remove audio content from your profile select the relevant content and choose to remove it. For example, you can remove playlists from your profile, or remove a track from your playlist<br>* to request deletion of your other personal data from Spotify (and thus close your account), follow the steps on our [support page](https://support.spotify.com/article/close-account/).

#### [Verifying requests, generally](#verifying-requests-generally)

To verify a consumer request to know, request to delete, and request to correct, we ask you to provide certain details related to your Spotify account. Please note, if you do not have a Spotify account we will not have enough information about you to verify your identity and respond to your requests, as we do not keep sufficient information necessary to re-identify and link you to a prior visit to the Spotify Service where data may have been collected. As such, we will be unable to verify and honor your requests.

#### [Household requests](#household-requests)

If all the members of a household make an access, correction or deletion request, we will respond as if the requests are individual requests.

#### [Tailored advertising controls](#tailored-advertising-controls)

What is tailored advertising?

* This is when we use information about your use of our Services and other websites and mobile apps to tailor ads to be more relevant to you. This is also known as interest based advertising, targeted advertising, or 'sharing' for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising.
* An example of tailored advertising is when an advertising partner has information suggesting you like cars. This could enable us to show you ads about cars.

How to control tailored advertising:

* You can control tailored advertising in your account [Privacy Settings](https://www.spotify.com/account/privacy/) under 'Tailored Ads'.
* If you do not have an account or are not logged in, you can also opt-out by clicking the ['Your Privacy Choices'](#optanon-toggle-info-display) link at the footer of our website
* You can also control tailored advertising for some podcasts using the link in the episode's show description. This applies where the content provider inserts advertising into the podcast to fund it. The hosting provider, which might not be Spotify, manages these controls for the podcast.

If you are 'opted out' of Tailored Ads in your [Privacy Settings](https://www.spotify.com/account/privacy/), you may still get advertising. This can include on our free Service Option, as well as our paid Service Option, as applicable (for example, advertising in podcasts). This type of advertising is based on your registration information and what you are currently listening to on our services. For example, if you are listening to a cooking podcast, you may hear an ad for a food processor.

Appropriate age for tailored advertising:

* The appropriate age for tailored advertising is determined by the country you are in and what rules apply to tailored advertising in that country. You will not receive Tailored Ads unless you have reached the appropriate age.
* You will not be able to 'opt-in' to Tailored Ads if you are under the appropriate age.
* You will start to receive Tailored Ads once you reach the appropriate age for your country. When this happens, you will receive a message within the Spotify Service to let you know. This message will contain a link to the [Privacy Settings](https://www.spotify.com/account/privacy/) where you can change your preferences or 'opt-out' of Tailored Ads at any time.

[6\. Data retention](#6-data-retention)
---------------------------------------

We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Spotify Service and for Spotify's legitimate and essential business purposes, such as:

* maintaining the performance of the Spotify Service
* making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings
* complying with our legal obligations
* resolving disputes

Here are some of the categories of our retention periods, and the criteria we use to determine them:

* **Data retained until you remove it**  
    It's your right to request that we delete certain of your personal data. See the section on 'Deletion' in [Section 2 'Your personal data rights and controls'](#2-your-personal-data-rights-and-controls) for more information, and the circumstances in which we can act on your request.  
    You can also delete certain personal data directly from the Spotify Service: for example, you can edit or delete your profile picture. Where users are able to see and update the personal data themselves, we keep the information for as long as the user chooses unless one of the limited purposes described below applies.
* **Data that expires after a specific period of time**  
    We have set certain retention periods so that some data expires after a specific period of time. For example, personal data you may input as part of search queries is generally deleted after 90 days.
* **Data retained until your Spotify account is deleted**  
    We keep some data until your Spotify account is deleted. Examples of this include your Spotify username and profile information. We also typically keep streaming history for the life of an account, for example, to provide retrospective playlists that users enjoy and personalized recommendations that take listening habits into account (for example, Your Time Capsule or Your Summer Rewind). When your Spotify account is deleted, this category of data is deleted or de-identified.
* **Data retained for extended time periods for limited purposes**  
    After your account is deleted, we keep some data for a longer time period but for very limited purposes. For example, we may be subject to legal or contractual obligations that require this. These may include mandatory data retention laws, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or data kept for the purposes of litigation. We may also keep data that has been removed from the Spotify Service for a limited period of time. This could be:
    * to help ensure user safety, or
    * to protect against harmful content on our platform.

This helps us investigate potential breaches of our [User Guidelines](https://www.spotify.com/legal/user-guidelines/) and [Platform Rules](https://www.spotify.com/platform-rules/). On the other hand, we will remove unlawful content if the law requires us to do so.

[7\. Transfer to other countries](#7-transfer-to-other-countries)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Because of the global nature of our business, Spotify transfers personal data internationally with Spotify group companies, subcontractors and partners when carrying out the activities described in this Policy.

Whenever we transfer personal data internationally, we use tools to make sure the data transfer complies with applicable law.

We also identify and use additional protections as appropriate for each data transfer. For example, we use:

* technical protections, such as encryption and pseudonymization
* policies and processes to challenge disproportionate or unlawful government authority requests

[8\. Keeping your personal data safe](#8-keeping-your-personal-data-safe)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

We're committed to protecting our users' personal data. We put in place appropriate technical and organizational measures to help protect the security of your personal data. However, be aware that no system is ever completely secure.

We have put various safeguards in place to guard against unauthorized access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems. These include pseudonymization, encryption, access, and retention policies.

To protect your user account, we encourage you to:

* use a strong password which you only use for your Spotify account
* never share your password with anyone
* limit access to your computer and browser
* log out once you have finished using the Spotify Service on a shared device
* read more detail on [protecting your account](https://support.spotify.com/article/protect-your-account/)

You can log out of Spotify in multiple places at once by using the 'Sign out everywhere' function on [your account page](http://www.spotify.com/account).

If other individuals have access to your Spotify account, then they can access personal data, controls and the Spotify Service available in your account. For example, you might have allowed someone to use your account on a shared device.

It's your responsibility to only allow individuals to use your account where you're comfortable sharing this personal data with them. Anyone else's use of your Spotify account may impact your personalized recommendations and be included in your data download.

[9\. Children](#9-children)
---------------------------

Note: This Policy doesn't apply to Spotify Kids unless the [Spotify Kids Privacy Policy](https://www.spotify.com/legal/kids-privacy-policy/) says so. Spotify Kids is a separate Spotify application.

The Spotify Service has a minimum 'Age Limit' in each country or region. The Spotify Service is not directed to children whose age:

* is under the age of 13 years
* makes it illegal to process their personal data, or
* requires parental consent to process their personal data

We do not knowingly collect or use personal data from children under the applicable Age Limit. If you're under the Age Limit, do not use the Spotify Service, and do not provide any personal data to us. Instead, we recommend using a [Spotify Kids](http://www.spotify.com/kids) account.

If you're a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify, [contact us](#11-how-to-contact-us).

If we learn that we've collected the personal data of a child under the applicable Age Limit, we'll take reasonable steps to delete the personal data. This may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child.

When using a shared device on the main Spotify Service, be cautious about playing or recommending any inappropriate content to individuals under 18 years old.

[10\. Changes to this Policy](#10-changes-to-this-policy)
---------------------------------------------------------

We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.

When we make material changes to this Policy, we'll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances. For example, we may display a prominent notice within the Spotify Service or send you an email or device notification.
