[](#1-about-this-policy)**1\. About this Policy**
-------------------------------------------------

This Policy describes how we process your personal data at USA Inc.

It applies to your use of:

* all Spotify streaming services as a user. For example this includes:
    * your use of Spotify on any device
    * the personalization of your user experience - watch [our personalization explainer video](https://www.spotify.com/privacy) to learn more about this
    * the infrastructure required to provide our services
    * connection of your Spotify account with another application
    * both our free or paid streaming options (each a '**Service Option**')
* other Spotify services which include a link to this Privacy Policy. These include Spotify websites, Customer Service and the Community Site

From now on, we'll collectively call these the '**Spotify Service**'.

From time to time, we may develop new or offer additional services. They'll also be subject to this Policy, unless stated otherwise when we introduce them.

**This Policy is _not_...**

* the Spotify [Terms of Use](https://www.spotify.com/legal/end-user-agreement/), which is a separate document. The Terms of Use outline the legal contract between you and Spotify for using the Spotify Service. It also describes the rules of Spotify and your user rights
* about your use of other Spotify services which have their own privacy policy. Other Spotify services include Anchor, Soundtrap, Megaphone and the Spotify Live app

We have included further information about rights and disclosures as required under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in our [California Privacy Disclosures](http://spotify.com/us/legal/California-privacy-disclosure) supplement.

**Other resources and settings**

Key information about your personal data is right here in this Policy. However, you might want to take a look at our other privacy resources and controls:

* [Privacy Center](https://www.spotify.com/privacy/): A user-friendly hub with summaries of key topics and helpful videos. It includes the 'Your Privacy Controls' video which shows you how to exercise your user rights and make choices about the way we process your data (see [Section 2 'Your personal data rights and controls'](#2-your-personal-data-rights-and-controls) for more on user rights).
* [Privacy Settings](https://www.spotify.com/account/privacy/): Control the processing of certain personal data, including Tailored Ads.
* [Notification Settings](https://www.spotify.com/account/notifications/) Set which marketing communications you get from Spotify.
* Settings (found in the Desktop and Mobile versions of Spotify): Control certain aspects of the Spotify Service such as 'Social' or 'Explicit Content'. On the 'Social' setting, you can:
    * start a Private session
    * choose whether to share what you listen to on Spotify with your followers
    * choose whether to show your recently played artists on your public profile

On the 'Explicit Content' setting you can control whether explicit-rated content can be played on your Spotify account.

* [Cookies Policy](https://www.spotify.com/legal/cookies-policy/): Information on how we use cookies and how to manage your cookie preferences. Cookies are files saved on your phone, tablet or computer when you visit a website.

[](#2-your-personal-data-rights-and-controls)**2\. Your personal data rights and controls**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Privacy laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation ('**GDPR**'), give rights to individuals over their personal data.

Some rights only apply when Spotify uses a certain 'legal basis' to process your data. We explain each legal basis, and when Spotify uses each one, in [Section 4 'Our purpose for using your personal data'](#4-our-purpose-for-using-your-personal-data).

The table below explains:

* your rights
* circumstances when they apply (such as the legal basis required)
* how to use them

You can also watch our video about [Your Privacy Controls](https://www.spotify.com/privacy).

We will only share the following personal data with those outlined in the table below:

* where we need to share personal data for the use of a Spotify Service feature, or a third party application, service or device, which you have chosen to use, or
* if you otherwise grant us your permission to share the personal data. For example, you can do it by selecting the appropriate setting in the Spotify Service or by giving your consent

| Categories of recipients | Categories of data you can choose to share | Reason for sharing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Third party applications, services and devices you connect to your Spotify Account | * User Data<br>* Usage Data | To connect your Spotify account, or allow you to use the Spotify Service in connection with third party applications, services or devices.  <br>Examples of such third party applications, services and devices include:<br><br>* social media applications<br>* speaker devices<br>* televisions<br>* automotive platforms<br>* voice assistants<br><br>  <br>You can see and remove many third party connections under ‘Apps’ in your account. |
| Support community | * User Data | To enable you to use the [Spotify Support Community service](https://community.spotify.com/).  <br>When you register for an account on the Spotify Support Community, we’ll ask you to create a profile name. This will be publicly displayed to anyone who uses the Spotify Support Community. We’ll also display any questions or comments you post. |

| --- | --- | --- |
| Service providers | * User Data<br>* Street Address Data<br>* Usage Data<br>* Voice Data<br>* Payment and Purchase Data<br>* Survey and Research Data | So they can provide their services to Spotify.  <br>These service providers include those we hire to:<br><br>* give customer support<br>* operate the technical infrastructure we need to provide the Spotify Service<br>* assist in protecting and securing our systems and services (e.g. Google’s reCAPTCHA)<br>* help market Spotify’s (and our partners’) products, services, events and promotions |
| Payment partners | * User Data<br>* Payment and Purchase Data | So they can process your payments, and for anti-fraud purposes. |

This is also known as interest based advertising.<br>* An example of a tailored ad is when an ad partner has information suggesting you like cars. This could enable us to show you ads about cars.  <br>      <br>    <br><br>**How to control tailored advertising:**<br><br>* You can control tailored advertising in your [account Privacy Settings](https://www.spotify.com/account/privacy/) under ‘Tailored Ads’.<br>* You can also control tailored advertising for some podcasts using the link in the episode’s show description. This applies where the content provider is funding their podcast by inserting either tailored advertising or content-based advertising into the podcast itself. These controls are managed by the hosting platform for the podcast, which might not be Spotify.  <br>      <br>    <br><br>If you are ‘opted out’ of Tailored Ads in your Privacy Settings, you may still get advertising on ad-supported services (e.g. podcasts or the Free Service Option).

We share certain User Data and Usage Data with these partners where necessary to:<br><br>* enable you to participate in Spotify promotions, including trials or other bundled offers<br>* to promote Spotify in media and advertising published on other online services<br>* help us and our partners to measure the effectiveness of Spotify promotions<br><br>  <br>Examples of partners include:<br><br>* marketing or sponsorship partners<br>* websites and mobile apps who sell us advertising space on their services<br>* device, app and mobile partners who also offer Spotify promotions<br><br>  <br>Our partners may also combine the personal data we share with them with other data they collect about you, e.g. your use of their services. We and our partners may use this information to present you with offers, promotions, or other marketing activities that we believe will be relevant to you. |
| Hosting Platforms | * Usage Data | Hosting platforms host podcasts so that they can deliver them to you. We share certain data, such as your IP address, with the hosting platforms when you play a podcast. Spotify owns two hosting platforms, Megaphone and Anchor. We also allow you to stream podcasts available from other hosting platforms not owned by Spotify.  <br>  <br>Podcast providers should explain in the show or episode description which platform is hosting the podcast. Please see the hosting platform’s own privacy policy for how they use data shared with them. |

* making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings
* complying with our legal obligations
* resolving disputes

Criteria used to determine the retention periods include:

* **How can we minimize the data retention period?** Our systems are designed to age out personal data in 90 days, unless another period is selected for legitimate business reasons.
* **Do we need to keep data to ensure the service that users expect?** We keep personal data for an appropriate period to deliver a personalized service to our users over time. We typically keep streaming history for the life of an account, for example, to provide retrospective playlists that users enjoy (e.g. Your Summer Rewind and the end-of-year Wrapped campaign) and personalized recommendations based on current listening habits.
* **Are users able to update or delete the data themselves?** Where users are able to see and update the personal data themselves, we keep the information for as long as the user chooses. For example, we keep your Spotify email address and other profile information until you choose to change or delete it yourself.
* **Do we need to keep the data to uphold our rules and keep our service safe?** To help ensure user safety, protect against harmful content on our platform, and take action with reports of intellectual property infringement, we may keep data that has been removed from the Spotify Service for a limited period of time. This helps us investigate potential breaches of our [User Guidelines](https://www.spotify.com/legal/user-guidelines/) and [Platform Rules](https://www.spotify.com/platform-rules/).
* **Is Spotify subject to a legal or contractual obligation to keep or delete the data?** Examples include mandatory data retention laws, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation or data kept for the purposes of litigation. Conversely, we will remove unlawful content if the law requires us to do so.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Because of the global nature of our business, Spotify shares personal data internationally with Spotify group companies, subcontractors and partners when carrying out the activities described in this Policy. They may process your data in countries whose data protection laws are not considered to be as strong as EU laws or the laws which apply where you live. For example, they may not give you the same rights over your data.

Whenever we transfer personal data internationally, we use tools to:

* make sure the data transfer complies with applicable law
* help to give your data the same level of protection as it has in the EU and the laws which apply where you live

[](#8-keeping-your-personal-data-safe)**8\. Keeping your personal data safe**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

We're committed to protecting our users' personal data. We put in place appropriate technical and organizational measures to help protect the security of your personal data. However, be aware that no system is ever completely secure.

We have implemented various safeguards to guard against unauthorised access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems. These include pseudonymisation, encryption, access, and retention policies.

To protect your user account, we encourage you to:

* use a strong password which you only use for your Spotify account
* never share your password with anyone
* limit access to your computer and browser
* log out once you have finished using the Spotify Service on a shared device
* read more detail on [protecting your account](https://support.spotify.com/article/protect-your-account/)

You can log out of Spotify in multiple places at once by using the 'Sign out everywhere' function on [your account page](http://www.spotify.com/account).

If other individuals have access to your Spotify account (for example if you've given them permission to use your account on a shared device), then they can access personal data, controls and the Spotify Service available in your account.

It's your responsibility to only provide individuals with permission to use your account where you're comfortable sharing this personal data with them. Anyone else's use of your Spotify account may impact your personalised recommendations and be included in your data download.

[](#9-children)**9\. Children**
-------------------------------

Note: This Policy doesn't apply to Spotify Kids unless the [Spotify Kids Privacy Policy](https://www.spotify.com/legal/kids-privacy-policy/) says so. Spotify Kids is a separate Spotify application.

The Spotify Service has a minimum 'Age Limit' in each country or region. The Spotify Service is not directed to children whose age:

* is under the age of 13 years, or
* makes it illegal to process their personal data, or
* requires parental consent to process their personal data

We do not knowingly collect or use personal data from children under the applicable Age Limit. If you're under the Age Limit, please do not use the Spotify Service, and do not provide any personal data to us. Instead, we recommend using a [Spotify Kids](http://www.spotify.com/kids) account.

If you're a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify, please [contact us](#11-how-to-contact-us).

If we learn that we've collected the personal data of a child under the applicable Age Limit, we'll take reasonable steps to delete the personal data. This may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child.

When using a shared device on the main Spotify Service, you should be cautious about playing or recommending any content to individuals under 18 years old which could be inappropriate for them.
