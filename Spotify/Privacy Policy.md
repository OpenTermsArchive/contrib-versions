4\. How we share the information we collect

We may share the information we collect, including your personal information, as follows:

4.1 Finding you and sharing within the Spotify Service

The Spotify Service is a social service which offers many ways to find, enjoy, and share content, and we enable and encourage users to explore who else is using the Service and their public profiles. Most of your Spotify information is or may be publicly available to others by default, such as your name and/or username, profile picture, type of subscription, your following relationships and your activity, including the music you add or favorite, Third Party Applications you add or use and User Content you post, upload and/or contribute to the Service. Your activity on the Service will automatically appear in the activity feed of friends and users who follow you or your Spotify profile content.

We may use your public information to promote the Service and to help others find and follow you and/or your Spotify profile content, including through Facebook and Other Integrated Services.

Your information may also be used to notify others, including on the Service, via e-mail, and through Facebook and Other Integrated Services, that you have joined Spotify, and about activity related to their Spotify profiles, content which they follow, or which we think otherwise may be of interest to them. Likewise, we may notify you about such activity of others.

Learn more about how to manage notifications, your publicly available information, and what you share with others in section 5 below.

4.2 Sharing with Facebook and other services

If you connect to Spotify using Facebook or otherwise connect your Spotify account to an Other Integrated Service, the default setting is generally that Spotify automatically shares your activity and activity-related stories with that service, including the music you listen to. You understand that such information may be attributed to your account on Facebook or the Other Integrated Service and may be published on such service. See section 5 below to learn how you can disable sharing of information on Facebook and Other Integrated Services.

Spotify also enables you to share a particular item of content, on an individual basis, to third party services or other Spotify users by using the share functionality in the Service. Please note that sharing of such content on a third party service may be posted as activity on the Service, regardless of your account settings. To share an individual item of content to a third party service, you’ll be prompted to enter your access credentials for that third party service. Spotify may store your username and an access token or similar credentials obtained from the third party service, so that you are able to share particular items of content, on that third party service, on an individual basis, without entering your access credentials again.

You understand and agree that Facebook’s or other third parties’ use of information they collect from you is governed by their privacy policies, and Spotify’s use of such information is governed by this Privacy Policy.

4.3 Sharing with Third Party Applications

To personalise your experience, we may share some information we have collected about you with providers of Third Party Applications, such as high-level geographic information, your musical preferences, settings and technical data. However, we take precautions to prohibit Third Party Application providers from attempting to identify you by using the information we provide to them or by collecting additional information without your consent.

Please note that if you:

1.  actively choose to provide Third Party Applications with additional information, such as by visiting a Third Party Application (which enables collection of your IP address), dragging and dropping a playlist into a Third Party Application, or allowing us to share precise geographic data which Third Party Application providers request from us. or
2.  consent to collection of additional information about you by a Third Party Application provider when you for example register with or log in to the Third Party Application,

the Third Party Application may be able to identify you and associate the information previously provided by Spotify with you. You agree and understand that a Third Party Application provider’s privacy policy governs its use of your information that we provide to it or that it collects from you. 4.4 Service providers and others

We may from time to time share your information with other companies in the Spotify group as well as certain trusted business partners and third party service providers to enable them to perform functions and process user data on our behalf, consistent with section 3 above. Such third parties' processing of user data will always be subject to security and confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.

4.5 Other sharing

In addition to the above, we may also share your information to third parties for these limited purposes:

1.  to allow a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets;
2.  to respond to legal process (e.g. a court order or subpoena), if we believe in good faith that it is necessary to do so. to comply with requirements of mandatory applicable law. to protect the safety of any person. to protect the rights and property of Spotify, including to enforce the Terms and Conditions of Use and Mobile Terms. and to address fraud, security or technical issues;
3.  to allow other companies in the Spotify Group to use your information as specified in this Privacy Policy;
4.  to inform business partners about use of the Service and products and services made available through the Service, in the form of aggregated statistics or otherwise in a format which does not reveal your identity. and
5.  if you expressly opt in to such sharing.

You understand and agree that the privacy policies of third parties will govern all use of information that we provide to them under this section.

5\. Your preferences

Through your settings, you can choose which communications you receive from us, manage your public information, and set your sharing preferences. However, please note that it may not be possible to make certain information private on the Service, including your name and/or username, profile picture, and other basic information, such as your following relationships. Such information and other information which are set to “public” in your settings, such as playlists, may be used, re-shared or linked to by others on the Service or others across the web, so please use Spotify carefully and manage your account settings regularly. Remember that if you make profile content private, others who already subscribe to or otherwise have the details of such content may still have access to it. Also keep in mind that playlists and other content added to your profile may include personal information, such as username, which could enable other persons to find you in the Spotify Service or other services.

To change, customise, or limit access to or sharing of information collected from Facebook or Other Integrated Service, please visit your account settings on that service.

6\. Transfer to other countries

Spotify processes information about our users on servers located in a number of countries. Accordingly, Spotify may share your information with other companies in the Spotify Group for the purpose of them carrying out any of the activities specified in this Privacy Policy. Spotify may also subcontract processing to or share your information with third parties located in countries, other than your home country. Information collected within the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and Switzerland may, for example, be transferred to, and processed by companies in the Spotify Group or other third parties identified above, located in a country outside of the EEA and Switzerland, where you may have fewer legal rights in relation to your information. However, the Spotify Group will only process your information as described in this Privacy Policy in every country. You expressly consent to your information being used as set out in this section 6.

7\. Links

We may display advertisements from third parties and other content which links to third party websites. We cannot control or be held responsible for third parties’ privacy practices and content. Please read their privacy policies to find out how they collect and process your personal information.

8\. Security

We are committed to protecting our users’ information. Your password protects your user account, so you should use a unique and strong password, limit access to your computer and browser, and sign off after having used the Spotify Service. While we take reasonable data protection precautions, no security measures are completely secure, and we do not guarantee the security of user information at any time.
