**What is meet.jit.si?**

8×8 is the main contributor to the [Jitsi.org](https://jitsi.org/) open-source video meetings solution.  Meet.jit.si is an application of the Jitsi.org open-source video meetings solution that 8×8 hosts, which allows users to hold free video meetings.

**What personal information does meet.jit.si process?**

To provide the meet.jit.si service, 8×8 processes network and usage information including IP addresses for the meeting participants, the user specified URL used to host the meeting, and information about the phone numbers that connect to the meeting (if audio connection is made via a telephone call).  In some cases, meeting related content, which may contain personal information, is temporarily stored to enable user functionality in a meet.jit.si video meeting.  Examples include:

*   If you use the chat function, chat content is stored during the meeting.
*   If you record a meeting, the recording of the meeting is temporarily stored until it is uploaded to your file hosting service (e.g. DropBox).
*   If you livestream your meeting, video content is temporarily stored to buffer the livestream.
*   In addition, users of meet.jit.si have the option of providing name, email address, and link to a picture that will be displayed to participants in the meeting.

**How is this information used?**

8×8 is not in the business of selling personal information to third parties.  8×8 uses this information to deliver the meet.jit.si service, to identify and troubleshoot problems with the meet.jit.si service, and to improve the meet.jit.si service.  In addition, 8×8 may use this information to investigate fraud or abuse.
