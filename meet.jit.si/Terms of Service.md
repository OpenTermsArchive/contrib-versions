2.  **The Service**

The Service is provided as-is and without support, and 8×8 makes no commitment or guarantee – and shall have no obligation – relating to any availability/unavailability, uptime/downtime, performance, reliability, functionality, features, or other operation/inoperation of the Service (including without limitation any integration or other feature of the Service designed to interoperate with any third-party offering (“**Integration**”)).  You acknowledge and agree that (a) the Service will not be uninterrupted, error-free, or available 100% of the time, (b) content may be transmitted, streamed, communicated, recorded, received and/or stored through the Service and other users or participants in Your meetings may export, save, store, record, or copy such content by or on behalf of You or other users in a variety of ways (including without limitation via third-party integrations or local or external download), (c) the Service is not intended to, and should not, be used for back-up or long-term storage of data, and (d) 8×8 shall not be responsible for any such exported content or any loss of such stored content.

In conjunction with or immediately after the Use of the Service, 8×8 may present users with information about or solicitations or advertisements for 8×8 or 8×8 services (“**Branding**”).  If you are integrating the Service with another service, product, or application for third-party users, or otherwise providing it to or making it available to third-party users for commercial purposes, you shall allow such Branding to be viewed and interacted with by such third-party users for a period of at least 15 seconds from when first presented, and you shall not otherwise remove, obscure, modify, or alter any such Branding.

Using the Service does not give You ownership of any intellectual property rights in the Service or any 8×8 or third-party content You access.  You may not use 8×8 or third-party content from the Service unless You obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law.  Other than displaying the branding contained in the Service, these Terms do not grant You the right to use any branding or logos used in the Service or that otherwise belong to 8×8.

You can stop using the Service at any time.  8×8 may – in its sole discretion, at any time, with or without notice, and without any obligation or liability to You or any other party – suspend, alter, or stop providing the Service to You or any other party for any or no reason, including without limitation if You do not comply with these Terms or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.  In short, you should not place any reliance on the Service being offered for any commercial or other purposes.  8×8 offers paid services designed to meet the needs of business users.

The Service is intended for reasonable use at commercially acceptable volumes.  As such, Your Use of the Service at no cost is limited to a maximum aggregate total of 25 Active End Points per calendar month (“**Monthly Active End Points**”) across all of Your accounts.  An “**Active End Point**” means a unique point of access, which may be a browser tab, laptop, mobile device, etc., (“**End Point**”) that is used to connect to or access a meeting on the Service that is also connected to or accessed by one or more other End Point. If 8×8 determines – in its sole discretion – that You are Using or responsible for Usage of the Service in excess of this limit, 8×8 may – in addition to any other rights and remedies provided under these Terms – limit such Use and/or require You to transition to a paid service in order to continue to Use the Service.

If You submit a name or photo to associate with Your use of the Service, we may display Your name and photo in conjunction with Your Use.  We will respect the choices You make to limit sharing or visibility of Your name and/or photo in the settings.  For example, You can choose to set Your settings so that Your name and photo do not appear.

7.  **Third-Party Offerings and Integrations**

Your relationship with third-party providers of offerings that interoperate or are used with the Service (e.g., third-party applications for which an Integration is available) shall in each case be governed by Your agreement with that third-party provider and shall be outside the scope of these Terms.  8×8 shall in no way be responsible or liable for such third-party provider, its actions or omissions, or its offerings.

8.  **Representations, Warranties, and Disclaimers**

8×8 provides the Service using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care, and we hope that You enjoy using it.  There are certain things that we do not promise about the Service.

OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THESE TERMS, NEITHER 8X8 NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES, WARRANTIES, OR COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE SERVICE.  FOR EXAMPLE, 8X8 DOES NOT MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT WITHIN THE SERVICE, THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF THE SERVICE, OR THEIR RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS.

IN ALL CASES, 8X8, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE.  THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATION SHALL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER EITHER PARTY WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR THE FAILURE OF THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY, AND ON A CUMULATIVE (RATHER THAN PER-INCIDENT) BASIS.

10.  **Business Uses of the Service**

If You are a legal entity or business Using the Service or on whose behalf the Service is being Used (“**Business User**”), You will hold harmless and indemnify 8×8 and its affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from any claim, suit or action arising from or related to the Use of the Service or violation of these Terms, including any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys’ fees.  The Business User is responsible for the activities of participants who Use the Service on behalf of or as a result of the Business User, and the Business User agrees to ensure that any and all such participants will comply with these Terms.

11.  **Waiver of Class Action**

The parties expressly waive any right to bring any action, lawsuit, or proceeding (collectively, “**Action**”) as a class or collective action, private attorney general action, or any other proceeding in which any party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity.  No Action will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected Actions.  If the class action waiver in this Section 11 is found to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then Section 11 will not apply solely with respect to those parts.  Instead, those parts will be severed and proceed in a court of law separately.

12.  **Other (but Still Important)**

We may modify, change, amend, replace or update these Terms or any additional terms that apply to the Service at any time and in any manner by updating the web page on which these Terms reside or otherwise notifying You.  You should look at these Terms regularly.  Any such modification, change, amendment, replacement or update shall be effective on the date of such update to the applicable web page (or on the date of such notification, where such notification is used by 8×8 in lieu of such update), or on such later date specified by 8×8.  If You do not agree to the modified terms for the Service, You should discontinue Your Use of the Service.

These Terms do not create any third-party beneficiary rights.

If You do not comply with these terms, and we do not take action right away, this does not mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).

If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.

The laws of the State of New York, U.S.A., excluding New York’s conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service. All claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts located in New York City, New York, USA, and You and 8×8 consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.
