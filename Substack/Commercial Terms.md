**Privacy**

Substack takes privacy very seriously and is committed to processing your personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) and that of other Substack users in accordance with applicable privacy and data protection legislation. For more information on how we process Personal Information please see our current Substack Privacy Policy.

Consistent with our own Privacy Policy, we may collect certain data on how Readers engage with Creator content. We will share, at our sole discretion, some of this information with you, including pageviews, open rates, Reader counts, and referral data. You agree that Substack is under no obligation to share this data with you.

Please note that our Privacy Policy only applies to the processing of Personal Information by Substack as a data controller, meaning whenever we process Personal Information for our own purposes. Where Substack processes Personal Information on behalf of you as a Creator, Substack qualifies as a data processor and you qualify as a data controller for the purposes of applicable data protection law that uses these terms.

In that case the following terms apply to such data processing:

* Each party shall comply with their respective statutory or regulatory data protection obligations.
    
* Substack shall process Personal Information in accordance with your instructions. Substack shall have no liability whatsoever for violations of privacy and data protection laws that arise as a result of Substack following your instructions under the Agreement.
    
* If you collect, use, store or otherwise process Personal Information provided by or collected from Substack users, you must do so securely and only for as long as it is needed and always in accordance with applicable privacy and data protection laws. 
    
* You are solely responsible for complying with any laws and regulations that apply to your processing of Personal Information on the Substack platform. if appropriate. 
    
* You shall ensure that all Personal Information that you supply or disclose to Substack has been obtained fairly and lawfully and that you have obtained all necessary consents and/or privacy notices required to permit Substack to fulfil its obligations under this Agreement.
    
* If you are based in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or the United Kingdom (“UK”), the processing of Personal Information by Substack on your behalf shall be governed by the terms of the data processing addendum attached to this Publisher Agreement as Annex 1.
    
* If you are a business for the purposes of the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), you may elect to have us act as your CCPA service provider. Contact us at privacy@substackinc.com to receive a copy of our service provider agreement.
    

To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, you agree to indemnify and hold Substack, its affiliates, officers, agents, employees, and partners harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising from or in any way related to any third party claims (including but not limited to fines or other sanctions imposed by data protection authorities) for any violations of this Publisher Agreement or applicable privacy and data protection laws attributable to you.

**Subprocessors**

Due to the nature of Substack’s business and the volume of users, our business needs and sub-processors may change from time to time. For example, we may need to remove a sub-processor to consolidate and minimize our use of sub-processors. Similarly, we may add a sub-processor if we believe, at our discretion, that doing so will improve our ability to deliver our services.

We will periodically update our sub-processors, as provided under Annex III, to reflect additions and removals to our list of our sub-processors. To receive email notifications of updates, as provided under Annex III, please contact Privacy@substackinc.com.

Under the terms of our Data Processing Agreement (DPA), a Creator may reasonably object in writing to the processing of its personal data by a new sub-processor within 30 days following the update of this page. If a Creator does not object during the 30-day time period, the appointment of the new sub-processor shall be deemed accepted by the Creator

**Terminating Your Account**

Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time for any reason. Upon such termination of this Agreement, your right to use Substack will immediately cease.  

We may terminate this Agreement or terminate, suspend, or restrict your access to or use of Substack at any time, for any reason. Reasons that may lead to us terminating or restricting access to Substack include a breach of any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement, your offensive or unacceptable behavior, objectionable material, or any other actions in violation of guidelines we specify. We will notify Creators as soon as reasonably practicable if Creators’ access to Substack is suspended or substantially limited due to technical problems with the platform. 

You agree that this means that publications (or any content therein) may be removed from Substack at any time in our discretion. You also agree that we retain the right to immediately halt the distribution of publications at our discretion. 

**Changes to this Agreement**

We are constantly trying to improve our products and services, so this Agreement may need to change along with Substack. We reserve the right to change the Agreement at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice on the website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. 

If you don’t agree with the new Agreement, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use Substack. If you use Substack in any way after a change to the Agreement is effective and notice has been provided, that means you agree to all of the changes. Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of this Agreement will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.

#### [](#data-processing-addendum-dpa)**[Data processing addendum (DPA)](https://substack.com/pa#data-processing-addendum-dpa)**

This data processing addendum (“DPA”) forms part of the Publisher Agreement and is entered into between Substack (as data processor) and the Creator (as data controller).

The terms of this DPA only apply if the Creator is based in the European Economic Area (“EEA’), in the United Kingdom (“UK”); or where, in the course of providing services to the Creator under the Publisher Agreement, Substack processes personal data on behalf of the Creator within the meaning of Articles 4(2) and 28 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) or its UK equivalent.

**Additional Definitions**.  For the purpose of this DPA the terms “personal data”, "processing", “data subject”, "controller" and "processor" have the meanings given to them in the GDPR or applicable data protection laws to which the Personal Information may be subject to the extent that such concepts exist in such laws.

“**EU Standard Contractual Clauses**” or “**EU SCCs**” shall mean the standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to third countries pursuant to the GDPR, adopted by the European Commission under Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/914, including the text from module two ;  .

**“Standard Contractual Clauses**” or “**SCCs**” means the EU Standard Contractual Clauses and/or the UK Standard Contractual Clauses (as applicable and consistent with the clarifying terms agreed by the Parties and set forth herein).

“**UK Standard Contractual Clauses**” (“**UK SCCs**”) means, collectively, the EU SCCs, consistent with the clarifications set forth herein, and the UK’s International Data Transfer Addendum (“**UK Addendum**”), attached as Annex 4 to the SCCs.

**Creator obligations**. The Creator:

* acknowledges that Substack, Substack affiliates and their respective third party service providers may process personal data in connection with the provision of Substack products and services to the Creator (the “Services”). A description of the processing activities performed in connection with the Services in provided in Appendix 1 to this DPA; 
    
* is solely responsible for compliance with the applicable data protection laws, including, but not limited to, the lawfulness of disclosing personal data to Substack and the lawfulness of having personal data processed on behalf of Creator; and
    
* ensures its instructions for processing personal data comply with the applicable data protection laws and the Creator shall have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality and legality of the personal data and the means by which the Creator acquired the personal data.
    

**Substack obligations**. Substack agrees:

* to process the personal data for the performance of the Services only in accordance with the documented instructions from the Creator as set out in the Publisher Agreement, this DPA or through the settings in the Services, and, without any obligation to perform a legal examination, that it will notify the Creator if Substack considers any such processing of personal data to be in violation of any applicable data protection laws;
    
* to process the personal data only to the extent, and in such manner, as it is necessary for the provision of the Services;
    
* that if it is legally required to process personal data otherwise than as instructed by the Creator, it will notify the Creator before such processing occurs unless prohibited from doing so by law;
    
* to ensure that access to the personal data is limited to those personnel who require such access, and such are bound by, and made aware of, their obligations of confidentiality with respect to protecting personal data; to use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide assistance to the Creator upon request and only where the Creator cannot do so without Substack’s assistance (i) in fulfilling data subjects’ requests for access, rectification, erasure, data portability or objection, and (ii) in fulfilling its obligations under the applicable data protection laws.
    
* to make available information and allowing for and contributing to audits, including inspections and information requests, conducted by the Creator or an auditor mandated by the Creator upon reasonable written notice and during regular business hours, and in each case with all Substack’s costs and expenses incurred being met by the Creator and only always limited to what is necessary to demonstrate compliance with applicable data protection laws;
    
* taking into account the state of the art and the costs of implementation, to implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk to personal data or data subjects, which shall include protecting personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, or unauthorized disclosure or access (“Personal Data Breach”). Appendix 2 to this DPA contains a description of these measures and safeguards. Creator understands and agrees that these measures are subject to technical progress and development and Substack is therefore expressly allowed to implement adequate alternative measures; and
    
* without undue delay notify the Creator in writing of any Personal Data Breach and keep the Creator informed of related developments. The Creator is solely responsible for complying with any notification obligations applicable to the Creator. The performance of Substack's obligation to report or respond to a Personal Data Breach under this article is not an acknowledgement by Substack of any fault or liability with regard to the Personal Data Breach.
    

**Use of sub-processors**. The Creator agrees that:

* Substack may use sub-processors to provide certain parts of the Services on Substack's behalf. The Creator hereby gives a general written authorization to Substack to engage any sub-processor for the processing of personal data.
    
* any sub-processors that are engaged by Substack for the provision of the Services shall be subject to written sub-processor terms with Substack requiring that the sub-processor abides by terms no less protective than this DPA.
    
* Substack currently uses the sub-processors included in Appendix 1 to this DPA. Substack may remove or appoint other suitable and reliable sub-processors at its own discretion in accordance with this article. Substack will give at least 6 weeks prior notice of any changes to the list of sub-processors. The Creator can object to a sub-processor by using its termination rights under the Agreement. If the Creator does not terminate the Agreement within this timeframe, the Creator is deemed to have accepted the respective sub-processor.
    
* where the sub-processor fails to fulfill its data protection obligations, Substack shall remain similarly liable to the Creator for the performance of its obligations under this DPA.
    

**Data transfers from the EEA**. The Creator understands and agrees that:

* Substack is based outside of the EEA in the US and that personal data may be transferred to the US or to other countries outside of the EEA provided that the specific conditions for such data transfers in applicable laws have been fulfilled.  
    
* Where applicable data protection laws require appropriate safeguards for a transfer of personal data to a third country, and in case no adequacy decision or any other appropriate data transfer mechanism applies, Substack shall enter into SCCs as further specified in Appendix 3 to this DPA. The Creator hereby expressly authorizes Substack to enter into SCCs (also) on its behalf and commissions Substack to enforce these SCCs on the Creator’s behalf where appropriate.
    
* Nothing in this DPA will be construed to prevail over any conflicting clause of any SCCs that have been entered into by Substack and for the prevention of doubt nothing in this DPA varies or modifies the SCCs nor affects any supervisory authority’s or data subject’s rights under the SCCs.
    

**Deletion or return of personal data.** On termination of the Publisher Agreement Substack will cease all processing of the personal data on behalf of the Creator and will as soon as possible delete the personal data or, if reasonably practicable to do so, return the personal data unless Substack is subject to a legal requirement to store the personal data. Substack has no liability or further obligation to the Creator with respect to the deletion of personal data as described in this section.

**Miscellaneous**

This DPA shall automatically terminate upon any termination or expiration of the Publisher Agreement. If there is any conflict between any provision of this DPA and any provision of the Publisher Agreement or the Terms of Use, this DPA shall prevail. If there is a conflict between this DPA and the SCCs the SCCs shall prevail.

In assessing the appropriate level of security, the Parties shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in the processing for the data subjects. The Parties shall in particular consider having recourse to encryption or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of processing can be fulfilled in that manner. In case of pseudonymisation, the additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific data subject shall, where possible, remain under the exclusive control of the data exporter. In complying with its obligations under this paragraph, the data importer shall at least implement the technical and organisational measures specified in Annex II. The data importer shall carry out regular checks to ensure that these measures continue to provide an appropriate level of security.

This is based on the understanding that laws and practices that respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, are not in contradiction with these Clauses.

Where this practical experience is relied upon to conclude that the data importer will not be prevented from complying with these Clauses, it needs to be supported by other relevant, objective elements, and it is for the Parties to consider carefully whether these elements together carry sufficient weight, in terms of their reliability and representativeness, to support this conclusion. In particular, the Parties have to take into account whether their practical experience is corroborated and not contradicted by publicly available or otherwise accessible, reliable information on the existence or absence of requests within the same sector and/or the application of the law in practice, such as case law and reports by independent oversight bodies.](https://substack.com/pa#as-regards-the-impact-of-such-laws-and-practices-on-compliance-with-these-clauses-different-elements-may-be-considered-as-part-of-an-overall-assessment-such-elements-may-include-relevant-and-documented-practical-experience-with-prior-instances-of-requests-for-disclosure-from-public-authorities-or-the-absence-of-such-requests-covering-a-sufficiently-representative-time-frame-this-refers-in-particular-to-internal-records-or-other-documentation-drawn-up-on-a-continuous-basis-in-accordance)**

This does not necessarily require completing and signing separate appendices for each transfer/category of transfers and/or contractual relationship, where this transparency can achieved through one appendix.

1.    Each Party agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions set out in this Addendum, in exchange for the other Party also agreeing to be bound by this Addendum.

2\. Although Annex 1.A and Clause 7 of the Approved EU SCCs require signature by the Parties, for the purpose of making Restricted Transfers, the Parties may enter into this Addendum in any way that makes them legally binding on the Parties and allows data subjects to enforce their rights as set out in this Addendum. Entering into this Addendum will have the same effect as signing the Approved EU SCCs and any part of the Approved EU SCCs.

#### [](#interpretation-of-this-addendum)**[Interpretation of this Addendum](https://substack.com/pa#interpretation-of-this-addendum)**

3\.     Where this Addendum uses terms that are defined in the Approved EU SCCs those terms shall have the same meaning as in the Approved EU SCCs. In addition, the following terms have the following meanings:

1\.     This Addendum must always be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with UK Data Protection Laws and so that it fulfills the Parties’ obligation to provide the Appropriate Safeguards.

2\. If the provisions included in the Addendum EU SCCs amend the Approved SCCs in any way which is not permitted under the Approved EU SCCs or the Approved Addendum, such amendment(s) will not be incorporated in this Addendum and the equivalent provision of the Approved EU SCCs will take their place.

3\. If there is any inconsistency or conflict between UK Data Protection Laws and this Addendum, UK Data Protection Laws applies.

4\. If the meaning of this Addendum is unclear or there is more than one meaning, the meaning which most closely aligns with UK Data Protection Laws applies.

5\. Any references to legislation (or specific provisions of legislation) means that legislation (or specific provision) as it may change over time. This includes where that legislation (or specific provision) has been consolidated, re-enacted and/or replaced after this Addendum has been entered into.

#### [](#hierarchy)**[Hierarchy](https://substack.com/pa#hierarchy)**

6\.     Although Clause 5 of the Approved EU SCCs sets out that the Approved EU SCCs prevail over all related agreements between the parties, the parties agree that, for Restricted Transfers, the hierarchy in Section ‎10 will prevail.

Where there is any inconsistency or conflict between the Approved Addendum and the Addendum EU SCCs (as applicable), the Approved Addendum overrides the Addendum EU SCCs, except where (and in so far as) the inconsistent or conflicting terms of the Addendum EU SCCs provides greater protection for data subjects, in which case those terms will override the Approved Addendum.

8\.     Where this Addendum incorporates Addendum EU SCCs which have been entered into to protect transfers subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 then the Parties acknowledge that nothing in this Addendum impacts those Addendum EU SCCs.

13.  The Parties may agree to change Clauses 17 and/or 18 of the Addendum EU SCCs to refer to the laws and/or courts of Scotland or Northern Ireland.

14.  If the Parties wish to change the format of the information included in Part 1: Tables of the Approved Addendum, they may do so by agreeing to the change in writing, provided that the change does not reduce the Appropriate Safeguards.

15.  From time to time, the ICO may issue a revised Approved Addendum which:
