When you place an order for delivery, you may communicate with your personal shopper via the Services about product replacements and other questions you or your personal shopper may have regarding the order. We collect the information contained in those communications.
    
* Information you make public. If you post in a public space on the Services or otherwise choose to make your Personal Information public on the Services (e.g., by sharing a recipe publicly on the Services), we collect such information. If you choose to share Personal Information publicly through the Services, please understand that we cannot control the actions of third parties who may access or collect this information.

b. Information collected by automated means 

When you use and interact with the Services, we automatically receive certain information about your device, browser, and/or activity:

* Browser and Activity Information. When you access the Services, we collect information about your activity and interactions with the Services, including but not limited to, the products with which you engage or place in your cart, information related to your orders, the pages that you navigate to, and the frequency and duration of your use of the Services. We also collect information regarding your interactions with our chat bots, emails, texts, notifications or other marketing from us (e.g., whether you opened or clicked). We also may use third party services that employ software code to record users’ interactions with the Services. Session replays include users’ clicks, mouse movements, scrolls, and keystrokes/key touches during those sessions. These replays help us diagnose usability problems and identify areas for improvement.
    
*  Device information. Our servers will record information about the computer, phone or other device you use to connect to the Services. This includes information such as your device’s IP address, your device type, browser information (such as browser type and any settings), internet service provider, mobile network carrier, mobile country code, operating system, and unique device identifiers.  We may also generate new unique identifiers using existing user device information. 
    
* Location Information. When you access the Services, we may collect information about your device’s location. For instance, if you allow the Services to access location services through the permission system used by your device's operating system or browser, we may collect the precise location of your device. We use your location information to facilitate the prompt hand-off of pickup orders (where available), to improve the accuracy of deliveries, to assist you in finding nearby stores for which pickup or delivery are available, and for other similar purposes. We may also use such information for analytic purposes. You can choose whether or not your device’s location information is shared with us by adjusting the settings on your device or browser, or when prompted by the Instacart application. We may also infer your general location, for example by using your device’s IP address.
    
* Cookies, Pixels, and Other Tracking Technologies. When you visit  or otherwise interact with our Services, we (and our partners, advertisers, and third-party advertising networks) may automatically collect information about you using device identifiers, cookies, pixels, tags, application programming interfaces (“APIs”), software development kits (“SDKs”) and similar technologies. We use this information for various purposes, including to: make the Services function properly; understand how you use the Services; personalize your experience; and measure, monitor, manage, display, and customize the advertisements you see.  
    

c. Information received from third parties

For example, if you choose to log in to the Services with your Facebook or Google account, we may receive information from these companies, such as your name and email address.
* Retailers. We may receive Personal Information from our retail partners in whose loyalty programs you participate, such as a confirmation of your loyalty member status, to enable you to receive your loyalty benefits, discounts and special promotions.

The pharmacy will also share whether the prescription drug product you have ordered requires temperature control. Additionally, if a prescription drug product delivered to you through the Services has been recalled, the pharmacy will share your name, email address, the date of the prescription drug product order, and the total amount to be refunded to you with us. 
    
* Our Business Partners and Service Providers. We may also receive information from our business partners and service providers, including the following:
    
    * Service Providers. We receive Personal Information from partners whom we engage to perform services for us, including those that provide market research, delivery services, map services, email or SMS communication platforms, or who assist us with providing, operating or maintaining parts of our services. This also includes our partner who processes and fulfills your restaurant orders that are linked to your Instacart account.
        
    * Instacart Partners. Partners who have implemented certain Instacart Services on their websites or applications may also let us collect information about your use of their sites or applications or share such information with us. This includes websites or applications that use Instacart’s APIs through which users can create or access their Instacart accounts. For example, if you use an Instacart Shoppable Recipe button on another site, we will receive information about your use of that button and of the third-party website or application. 
        
    * Co-branded Partners. Partners with whom we operate co-branded businesses, offer co-branded products.

2\. Payment Processors and Partners
-----------------------------------

When you pay for orders using a credit card or other payment method on our Services, your credit card or other payment information is collected and processed by our third-party payment processors. For example, if you pay with a credit card, the payment information that you provide through the Services is transmitted directly to our payment processor. We may receive certain information about your payment card from our payment processors, such as the last 4 digits of your card number and its expiration month and year. Certain Services allow you to place restaurant orders. Where available, if you place a restaurant order, our restaurant partner will collect and process your credit card or other payment information in order to fulfill the order. 

  

We also make available opportunities to pay for orders via other payment partners that may redirect you to their websites to submit your payment information. For instance, if you use an online payment system provider to make purchases through the Services, you will be directed to their websites to provide your payment information. These payment providers’ privacy policies apply to the information you provide to them through their website.

6\. Prescription Deliveries (not available on Fizz by Instacart or Instacart White Label Sites)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

If you use the Services for a prescription delivery, we collect information from the pharmacy processing your prescription as described in “Information We Collect” above. Some of this information that we collect about you in connection with your prescription delivery may relate to: (i) your past, present or future physical or mental health or condition; (ii) the provision of health care to you; or (iii) your past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care (“Personal Health Information”). This Section governs our use and disclosure of your Personal Health Information. If there is a conflict between the terms of this Section and any other terms of this Privacy Policy or the Instacart Terms of Services, the terms in this Section will govern. 

  

To the extent that we receive, create, maintain, use, or disclose any of your Personal Health Information, we will maintain the privacy and security of such information as required by applicable law, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the regulations promulgated under that Act (“HIPAA”). 

  

If you reside in the U.S., your Personal Health Information is protected under HIPAA and state law (depending on your state of residence). These laws give you rights with respect to the access, use, and disclosure of Personal Health Information by your health care providers, such as pharmacies, and us. When you place a pharmacy order using the Services, the pharmacy responds as we have described above in the “Information Collection” section by disclosing to Instacart your status as a patient of the pharmacy, and in some cases your prescription refill information if you select. Information concerning your status as a patient of the pharmacy is protected by HIPAA. For a more complete description of your rights under HIPAA and the uses and disclosures of your Personal Health Information, please refer to your pharmacy's Notice of Privacy Practices. We will not disclose your Personal Health Information without your prior written consent with other people or non-affiliated companies unless: (i) such disclosure is necessary in order to provide the Services; (ii) to your pharmacy on their instruction, (iii) the Personal Health Information has been “de-identified” so that it cannot identify you; (iv) such disclosure is required by law; or (v) such disclosure is in connection with a business transaction or bankruptcy proceeding.  

  

7\. Restaurant Orders (not available on Fizz by Instacart or Instacart White Label Sites)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To make the restaurant experience available to you on Instacart, we share certain of your Personal Information with our restaurant partner who facilitates the restaurant experience for Instacart and allows Instacart to deliver restaurant-related content and offers on our Services. When you place a restaurant order, our restaurant partner will collect and process your credit card or other payment information in order to fulfill the order. Our restaurant partner may use certain of your information in order to provide the restaurant services, including to provide customer support, and will also disclose this information to the couriers and restaurants from which you placed an order so they can prepare and hand your order directly to you or to the courier who will deliver it to you. Your restaurant orders are linked to your Instacart account and you can request information about those orders by exercising your Privacy Choices below. 

  

8\. Children's Privacy
----------------------

We understand the importance of protecting the privacy of children, especially in the online environment. The Services are not designed for or intentionally directed to children under the age of 18, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 18. Fizz by Instacart is not designed for or intentionally directed at individuals under the age of 21. If we become aware that we have received Personal Information from an individual under the age of 18, or in the case of Fizz by Instacart under the age of 21, we will take reasonable steps to remove the individual’s Personal Information from our records.      

  

9\. Third-Party Websites
------------------------

Some links on the Services may redirect you to third-party websites and services that we do not operate. We may also offer social sharing tools that let you share actions on the Services with other websites and vice versa. The privacy practices of these websites and services will be governed by their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review and understand their privacy policies before disclosing any Personal Information to them.  

  

10\. Information Security
-------------------------

We employ and maintain reasonable administrative, physical, and technical measures designed to safeguard and protect Personal Information under our control from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. 

  

In addition, when we collect, maintain, access, use, or disclose your Personal Health Information, we do so using systems and processes consistent with information privacy and security requirements under applicable federal and state laws, including, without limitation, HIPAA. Nevertheless, because no data transmission or storage system is completely secure, we cannot guarantee the security of your information. 

  

11\. Cross-Border Transfers
---------------------------

Instacart operates a global business, and we use vendors located around the world to help us run our business. Accordingly, the disclosures described above may result in the transfer of your Personal Information outside of the country or region in which you reside. For example, the Personal Information of customers located in Canada will be transferred outside of Canada (and for residents of Quebec, outside of Quebec), including to the United States. 

  

When we transfer your Personal Information outside of your country or province of residence, we do so in accordance with applicable law and take appropriate steps to ensure your information is protected. However, please note that while outside of the jurisdiction in which you reside, some of your Personal Information will be subject to applicable local laws, which may permit government and national security authorities in those jurisdictions to access your Personal Information in certain circumstances. 

  

12\. Information Retention
--------------------------

We keep Personal Information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we have collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. 

  

To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information; the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the Personal Information; the purposes for which we use the Personal Information; whether we can achieve those purposes through other means; and the applicable laws that require us to retain information for regulatory purposes or permit us to retain the information to preserve our legal rights. 

  

13\. Your Privacy Choices
-------------------------

Depending on your place of residence, under applicable law, you can make certain choices and exercise certain rights with respect to our use of your Personal Information. Please note that rights and requests may be subject to applicable exceptions. We will not discriminate against you if you decide to exercise these rights:

  

a. Correct or update your account information and settings 

If you have created an account through the Services, you may review, correct, or update your information (including your name, telephone number, delivery address, and payment information) at any time by logging in to your account and visiting the “Account Settings” page. Please note that changes to your settings may require some time to take effect. If you do not have or no longer have access to your Instacart account, please email us at [customerprivacy@instacart.com](mailto:customerprivacy@instacart.com) to submit your requests.

  

b. Exercise your marketing choices 

We may send you periodic marketing and promotional emails, push notifications and/or text messages to your mobile device, and where required by law we will obtain your consent to do so. If you no longer wish to receive our marketing and promotional communications, you may opt out of receiving them by following the opt-out instructions included in any communication that you receive from us or by visiting your Account Settings. Please note that even if you opt out of receiving marketing and promotional communications from us, we may still send you administrative and transactional messages from which you cannot opt out.    

  

c. Request to Access or Delete your Personal Information

You may request that Instacart provide you with a copy of your Personal Information or request that we delete your Personal Information. Prior to processing your requests, we must verify the identity of the requestor to help ensure that we do not for example provide your information to another person. To do so, we require you to submit up to three pieces of Personal Information that we then match against the account information we have on file for you. 

* Account Holders. If you have an active Instacart account, click [here](https://www.instacart.com/user_privacy/authenticate) to submit a request to access or delete your Personal Information. You will be prompted to re-log in to the Services.
    
* Non-Account Holders. If you no longer have access to your Instacart account, please email us at [customerprivacy@instacart.com](mailto:customerprivacy@instacart.com) to submit your requests. 
    
* Authorized Agents. If you reside in California, Canada, or Colorado, you may authorize another person or entity to submit an access or deletion request on your behalf (an “Authorized Agent”). As part of our verification process, we will require proof concerning their status as an Authorized Agent. We will also require you to directly confirm with us that you provided the person or business entity with permission to submit the request. Authorized Agent can submit access and deletion requests by emailing us at [customerprivacy@instacart.com](mailto:customerprivacy@instacart.com). 
    

  

d. Opt-out of the Sales and Sharing (Behavioral Advertising) (not available in all states)

In certain states, you have the right to opt out of the sale and sharing of your information for Behavioral Advertising (also referred to as targeted advertising). If available in your state, you can exercise your right to opt out by visiting [this link](https://www.instacart.com/accounts/your-privacy-choices). Sharing and sales can occur, for example, where Instacart shares information about you with certain partners, including social media publishers, to enable Instacart or its partners to provide you with personalized ads on third party sites or applications and to better understand engagement with such advertising.  

  

Depending on your place of residence, under applicable law, you can use certain preference signals to exercise your sale and sharing opt-out right automatically with all businesses that you interact with online, including Instacart. If you enable a browser-based opt-out preference signal that complies with applicable law, such as Global Privacy Control (GPC), upon receipt or detection, we will treat the signal as a valid request to opt out of the sale or sharing of Personal Information linked to that browser and any consumer profile we have associated with that browser. Please note that if you use different browsers or browser profiles, you will have to enable the signal on each one that you use.

  

Please note that even if you opt-out of the sale of your information and the sharing of your information for Behavioral Advertising, you may continue to see advertisements from Instacart and/or our partners; however, these advertisements will not be as relevant or personalized to you.

e. Appeals

If you submit a request to exercise any of the rights described above and we do not take action on the request, you may appeal our decision if you are in an eligible jurisdiction. To appeal our decision, please email us at [PrivacyAppeals@instacart.com](mailto:customerprivacy@instacart.com) with the subject line “Rights Request Appeal.”

  

f. Do Not Track. “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) is a developing standard for web browsers that aims to inform the websites you visit that you do not want information about your online activity collected over time and across third-party websites or online services. Although we do our best to honor the privacy preferences of our users, we do not interpret or respond to DNT or other similar signals from your browser at this time. For more information, visit [http://www.allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/).

Please note that if you use different browsers or browser profiles, you will have to enable the signal on each one that you use.
