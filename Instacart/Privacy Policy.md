    *   **Payment information**. If you place an order through the Services, we collect your billing address and method of payment. Additional details regarding the processing of your payment information can be found [below](#otnotice-section-da275df2-ad8a-4b44-8a5b-3ee999c0089f).
    *   **Fresh Funds**. If you participate in a Fresh Funds program and enter a Fresh Funds code to redeem your Fresh Funds credits, we collect information necessary for us to administer the program, including the name of the Fresh Funds partner in whose program you participate, your Fresh Funds balance, and the products you purchased with your Fresh Funds.
    *   **Personal shopper interactions**. When you place an order for delivery, you may communicate with your personal shopper via the Services about product replacements and other questions you or your personal shopper may have regarding the order. We collect the information contained in those communications.
    *   **Information you make public**. If you post in a public space on the Services or otherwise choose to make your Personal Information public on the Services (e.g., by sharing a recipe publicly on the Services), we collect such information. If you choose to share Personal Information publicly through the Services, please understand that we cannot control the actions of third parties who may access or collect this information. 
    *   **Customer service interactions**. If you interact or communicate with our customer service representatives, we collect the information you provide during such interactions.
    *   **Other information**. We collect any other information that you choose to provide during your interactions with our Services, including your responses to surveys that you choose to participate in (for example customer satisfaction surveys) or information that you provide directly to us regarding an experience with one of our retailers.
    *   **Information about other people**. In some cases, you may provide information to us about other people. For example, you may refer a friend to Instacart or send an Instacart gift delivery or gift card to someone. In these cases, we collect the recipient’s name, email, and delivery address, as applicable. You may also participate in Family Accounts and provide us information about your association with another Instacart customer. When you provide someone else’s information via the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that you have permission to share their information with Instacart. You may not provide Personal Information about children under the age of 18.
2.  **Information Collected by Automated Means**   
    When you use and interact with the Services, such as when you browse our website or use our app, we automatically collect certain information about your device, browser, and activity:
    *   **Browser and activity information**. When you access the Services, we collect information about your activity and interactions with the Services. This includes the products with which you engage or place in your cart, information related to your orders, the pages that you navigate to, and the frequency and duration of your use of the Services. We also collect information regarding your interactions with our chat bots, emails, texts, notifications, or other marketing from us (e.g., whether you opened or clicked). 
        *   We also may use third party services that employ software code to record users’ interactions with the Services. Session replays include users’ clicks, mouse movements, scrolls, and keystrokes/key touches during those sessions. These replays help us diagnose usability problems and identify areas for improvement.
    *   **Device information**. Our servers will record information about the computer, phone, or other device you use to connect to the Services. This includes information such as your device’s IP address, your device type, browser information (such as browser type and any settings), internet service provider, mobile network carrier, mobile country code, operating system, and unique device identifiers. We may also generate new unique identifiers using existing user device information. 
    *   **Location information**. When you access the Services, we may collect information about your device’s location in different ways: 
        *   _General location_. We infer your general location (such as country, region, or city), for example by using your device’s IP address. We rely on this general location to maintain security and prevent fraud (for example, detect suspicious or unusual access patterns), present localized experiences (such as content availability), comply with regional laws and obligations (for example, consent/opt-out prompts and notices), and to measure and improve our services through aggregated analytics. IP-based geolocation may be approximate and can reflect the location of your internet service provider or a VPN endpoint.
        *   _Precise geolocation_. If you choose to allow the Services to access location services through the permission system used by your device’s operating system or browser, we may collect the precise location of your device. We use your location information to facilitate the prompt hand-off of pickup orders (where available), to improve the accuracy of deliveries, to assist you in finding nearby stores for which pickup or delivery are available, and for other similar purposes. We may also use such information for our analytics purposes and to better understand how we can improve the Services. You can choose whether or not your device’s location information is shared with us by adjusting the settings on your device or browser, or when prompted by the Instacart application. 
    *   **Cookies, pixels, and other tracking technologies**. When you visit or otherwise interact with our Services, we (and our partners, advertisers, and third-party advertising networks) may automatically collect information about you using device identifiers, cookies, pixels, tags, application programming interfaces (“**APIs**”), software development kits (“**SDKs**”) and similar technologies. We use this information for various purposes, including to make the Services function properly, understand how you use the Services, personalize your experience, and measure, monitor, manage, display, and customize the advertisements you see.
3.  **Information Received From Other Sources or Parties**   
    We may receive Personal Information about you from other sources or parties. For example: 
    *   **Single Sign-on services**. Certain of our Services allow you to login using your credentials from a third-party platform, for example, using your Facebook or Google logins. If you log in to the Services through these third-party platforms, then depending on your settings on these platforms, we may receive some information about you from them, including your name, email address, device identifier and other identifiers.
    *   **Retailers**. We may receive Personal Information from our retail partners in whose loyalty programs you participate, such as a confirmation of your loyalty member status, to enable you to receive your loyalty benefits, discounts, and special promotions.
    *   **Prescriptions**. Certain Services allow you to place an order to have your prescriptions delivered to you from your pharmacy. If you use the Services for prescription delivery, the pharmacy processing your prescription will provide us with your name, delivery address, email address, birth date, telephone number, the total amount (including sales tax, where applicable) being charged to you for the prescription drug product(s) purchased, the prescription number(s) and in some case the total number of refills and your refill count (if you select to have refills fulfilled through Instacart). The pharmacy will also share whether the prescription drug product you have ordered requires temperature control. Additionally, if a prescription drug product delivered to you through the Services has been recalled, the pharmacy will share your name, email address, the date of the prescription drug product order, and the total amount to be refunded to you with us. 
    *   **Our Vendors and Business Partners**. We may also receive information, including contact, account, order, payment, and activity information, from our vendors and business partners, including the following:
        *   _Service providers and other vendors_. We receive Personal Information from our service providers and other vendors that we engage to perform services for us, including those that provide market research, delivery services, map services, email, or SMS communication platforms, or who assist us with providing, operating, or maintaining parts of our Services. This also includes our vendor who processes and fulfills your restaurant orders that are linked to your Instacart account.
        *   _Instacart partners_. Partners who have implemented or integrated certain Instacart services on their websites or applications may also let us collect information about your use of their sites or applications or share such information with us. This includes websites or applications that use Instacart’s APIs through which users can create or access their Instacart accounts and Instacart experiences that are embedded in a partner’s application. For example, if you use an Instacart Shoppable Recipe button on another site, we will receive information about your use of that button and of the third-party website or application. 
        *   _Marketing and Advertising partners_. We receive Personal Information about you, including advertising identifiers, contact information, browsing activity and related data about you from other parties, to supplement the information we collect, and from partners with whom we work for advertising measurement, analytics, and attribution.
            *   Co-branded partners. Partners with whom we operate co-branded businesses, offer co-branded products.
            *   Payment partners. We receive payment information from our payment providers, processors and partners (see [below](#otnotice-section-da275df2-ad8a-4b44-8a5b-3ee999c0089f)[](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/policies/a8797342-d101-4396-b90e-665be5a6eacb?context=eyJkc1BvcnRhbElkIjoiY2QxYTBjNDEtYTUwNS00NjQyLWJiN2UtYTdhMjc4NjViYmZmIn0=#section-header-2)).

        *   Instacart personal shoppers. We may receive Personal Information about you from Instacart personal shoppers in connection with your delivery, including information about your address and delivery details.
    *   **Other Parties**. We also may collect or receive Personal Information relating to you from:
        *   Other Instacart Services account owners. If other Instacart Services account owners invite you to place orders or request other services through their accounts, such as Family Accounts or Instacart Business Accounts, we collect information about your activities on those accounts.
        *   Other Instacart customers, if they refer you to our Services, send you a gift or other order delivery through our Services.
        *   Law enforcement, public health, and other governmental authorities.
        *   Publicly available sources.

2\. Payment Processors and Partners
-----------------------------------

When you pay for orders using a credit card or other payment method on our Services, your credit card or other payment information is collected and processed by our third-party payment processors. For example, if you pay with a credit card, the payment information that you provide through the Services is transmitted directly to our payment processor. We may receive certain information about your payment card from our payment processors, such as the last 4 digits of your card number and its expiration month and year. Certain Services allow you to place restaurant orders. Where available, if you place a restaurant order, our restaurant partner will collect and process your credit card or other payment information in order to fulfill the order. 

We also make available opportunities to pay for orders via other payment partners that may redirect you to their websites to submit your payment information. For instance, if you use an online payment system provider to make purchases through the Services, you will be directed to their websites to provide your payment information. These payment providers’ privacy policies apply to the information you provide to them through their website.

6\. Prescription Deliveries (Not Available on Instacart White Labels)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If you use the Services for a prescription delivery, we collect information from the pharmacy processing your prescription as described in [Information We Collect](#otnotice-section-06f0417d-c301-4b27-9d62-2a850f9e81a8)[](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/policies/a8797342-d101-4396-b90e-665be5a6eacb?context=eyJkc1BvcnRhbElkIjoiY2QxYTBjNDEtYTUwNS00NjQyLWJiN2UtYTdhMjc4NjViYmZmIn0=#section-header-1) above. Some of this information that we collect about you in connection with your prescription delivery may relate to: (i) your past, present or future physical or mental health or condition; (ii) the provision of health care to you; or (iii) your past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care (“**Personal Health Information**”). This Section governs our use and disclosure of your Personal Health Information. If there is a conflict between the terms of this Section and any other terms of this Privacy Policy or the Instacart Terms of Services, the terms in this Section will govern.

To the extent that we receive, create, maintain, use, or disclose any of your Personal Health Information, we will maintain the privacy and security of such information as required by applicable law, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the regulations promulgated under that Act (“**HIPAA**”). 

If you reside in the U.S., your Personal Health Information is protected under HIPAA and state law (depending on your state of residence). These laws give you rights with respect to the access, use, and disclosure of Personal Health Information by your health care providers, such as pharmacies, and us. When you place a pharmacy order using the Services, the pharmacy responds as we have described above in the “Information Collection” section by disclosing to Instacart your status as a patient of the pharmacy, and in some cases your prescription refill information. Information concerning your status as a patient of the pharmacy is protected by HIPAA. For a more complete description of your rights under HIPAA and the uses and disclosures of your Personal Health Information, please refer to your pharmacy's Notice of Privacy Practices. We will not disclose your Personal Health Information without your prior written consent with other people or non-affiliated companies unless: (i) such disclosure is necessary in order to provide the Services; (ii) to your pharmacy on their instruction, (iii) the Personal Health Information has been “de-identified” so that it cannot identify you; (iv) such disclosure is required by law; or (v) such disclosure is in connection with a business transaction or bankruptcy proceeding.

7\. Restaurant Orders (Not Available on Instacart White Label Sites)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

To make the restaurant experience available to you on Instacart, we share certain of your Personal Information with our restaurant partner who facilitates the restaurant experience for Instacart and allows Instacart to deliver restaurant-related content and offers on our Services. When you place a restaurant order, our restaurant partner will collect and process your credit card or other payment information in order to fulfill the order. Our restaurant partner may use certain of your information in order to provide the restaurant services, including to provide customer support, and will also disclose this information to the couriers and restaurants from which you placed an order so they can prepare and hand your order directly to you or to the courier who will deliver it to you. Your restaurant orders are linked to your Instacart account, and you can request information about those orders by exercising your Privacy Choices below. 

8\. Children’s Privacy
----------------------

We understand the importance of protecting the privacy of children, especially in the online environment. The Services are not designed for or intentionally directed to children under the age of 18. If we become aware that we have received Personal Information from an individual under the age of 18, we will take reasonable steps to remove the individual’s Personal Information from our records.     

9\. Third-Party Websites
------------------------

Some links on the Services may redirect you to third-party websites and services that we do not operate. We may also offer social sharing tools that let you share actions on the Services with other websites and vice versa. The privacy practices of these websites and services will be governed by their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review and understand their privacy policies before disclosing any Personal Information to them. 

10\. Information Security
-------------------------

We employ and maintain reasonable administrative, physical, and technical measures designed to safeguard and protect Personal Information under our control from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. 

In addition, when we collect, maintain, access, use, or disclose your Personal Health Information, we do so using systems and processes consistent with information privacy and security requirements under applicable federal and state laws, including, without limitation, HIPAA. Nevertheless, because no data transmission or storage system is completely secure, we cannot guarantee the security of your information. 

11\. Cross-Border Transfers
---------------------------

Instacart operates a global business, and we use vendors located around the world to help us run our business. Accordingly, the disclosures described above may result in the transfer of your Personal Information outside of the country or region in which you reside. For example, the Personal Information of customers located in Canada will be transferred outside of Canada (and for residents of Quebec, outside of Quebec), including to the United States. 

When we transfer your Personal Information outside of your country or province of residence, we do so in accordance with applicable law and take appropriate steps to ensure your information is protected. However, please note that while outside of the jurisdiction in which you reside, some of your Personal Information will be subject to applicable local laws, which may permit government and national security authorities in those jurisdictions to access your Personal Information in certain circumstances. 

12\. Information Retention
--------------------------

We keep Personal Information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we have collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. 

To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information; the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the Personal Information; the purposes for which we use the Personal Information; whether we can achieve those purposes through other means; and the applicable laws that require us to retain information for regulatory purposes or permit us to retain the information to preserve our legal rights. 

13\. Your Privacy Choices
