Last updated: August 15, 2023
=============================

Thank you for using Instacart! These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the Instacart services, including any websites, mobile applications, devices, APIs, or artificial intelligence (“AI”) powered generative experiences that are operated by Instacart or its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, the “Services”), and are entered into by you and Maplebear Inc. (d/b/a Instacart), a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries and affiliates (“Instacart”). This Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and other parties who access the Services (each, hereafter, a “user”). 

  

By using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and acknowledge and agree to the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with Instacart’s [Privacy Policy](https://www.instacart.com/privacy).  If you are using or accessing the Services through a Business Account, your use of the Services is governed by the [Instacart Business Account Terms and Conditions](https://www.instacart.com/terms-business).

  

SECTION 17 (“DISPUTES & ARBITRATION”) OF THESE TERMS (THE “ARBITRATION AGREEMENT”) PROVIDES THAT ANY CLAIMS THAT YOU AND INSTACART HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY CLAIMS THAT AROSE OR WERE ASSERTED BEFORE THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THESE TERMS, WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, BE SUBMITTED TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION. UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TO PURSUE CLAIMS AND SEEK RELIEF AGAINST INSTACART ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU ALSO WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO SEEK RELIEF IN A COURT OF LAW AND TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL ON YOUR CLAIMS. PLEASE SEE SECTION 17 FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, AND HOW TO OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. 

  

The Services include a technology platform that presents you with a set of one or more retailer (each a “Retailer”) virtual storefronts from which you can select goods for picking and packing by one or more personal shoppers and delivery to your location or, if available, for you to pick up in-store. Depending on the Retailer from whom you purchase goods through the Services, picking and packing, and delivery services may be performed by third parties, which may include Retailer personnel, independent contractors, and third-party logistics providers (collectively, “Third Party Providers”). 

  

You acknowledge that Instacart does not supervise, direct, or control the performance of services provided by Third Party Providers, and that Third Party Providers are neither employed by, nor in any partnership or joint venture or agency relationship with, Instacart.  

  

When you use the Services to place an order for goods, you authorize the purchase of those goods from the Retailers you select and, if you have selected delivery services, the delivery of those goods by Third Party Providers. Unless otherwise specified, you acknowledge and agree that Instacart and the Third Party Provider are collectively acting as your agents in the ordering, picking, packing, and/or delivery of goods purchased by you and that the Retailer—not the Third Party Provider and not Instacart—is the seller of the goods to you. You agree that your purchase is being made from the Retailer you have selected, that Retailer is the merchant of record, and that title to any goods passes to you when they are purchased at the applicable Retailer’s store. You agree that Instacart or the applicable Retailer will obtain an authorization for your credit card, debit card, or other payment method on file with Instacart to cover the cost of the goods you have purchased from the Retailer and any separate Instacart fees and optional tips, and your payment method  will be charged for the goods purchased by you and any applicable fees, taxes and/or tips. 

  

Instacart may change the fees it charges for the Services, including but not limited to delivery fees, priority fees, service fees (including additional service fees and/or surcharges to help offset specific costs), alcohol service fees, heavy order fees, direct-to-consumer shipping fees, long distance fees (for deliveries outside the delivery area for a Retailer), and special handling fees. Instacart may vary certain fees based on demand, order attributes, and/or other factors.  Your payment instrument will be temporarily authorized for an amount greater than the total amount of the purchase appearing in the original check out. This higher authorized amount will be disclosed during the purchase process and is a temporary authorization charge on your order, to deal with situations where your total purchase amount turns out to be higher than the original amount due to special requests, added items, replacement items, weight adjustments, or tips that you may elect to add after delivery. Retailers set the prices of the goods on the Services, and some Retailers may set prices for goods on the Services that differ from in-store prices, differ between storefronts, or differ from the prices available on other online platforms or services. The prices displayed on the Services may not be the lowest prices at which the same goods or items are sold. Individual Retailers may operate multiple storefronts with different pricing, selection, and order fulfillment. You can view each Retailer’s pricing policies (which may change from time to time) on their storefront(s) on both the website and in the Instacart app. 

  

You also acknowledge and agree that, except as expressly provided for otherwise in these Terms or a separate agreement between you and Instacart, Instacart does not form any employment or agency relationship with you and does not hold title to any goods that you order through the Services. 

  

Unless otherwise indicated, all prices and other amounts are in the currency of the jurisdiction where the delivery takes place. 

  

Occasionally there may be information on the Services that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies, or omissions that may relate to pricing, product descriptions, promotional offers, and product availability. Instacart reserves the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions and to change or update information or refuse or cancel orders if any information on the Services is inaccurate at any time without prior notice (including after you have submitted your order and/or your payment method has been charged).

============================

By creating an Instacart user account, you agree to accept and receive communications from Instacart or Third Party Providers, including via email, text message, calls, and push notifications to the cellular telephone number you provided to Instacart. You understand and agree that you may receive communications generated by automatic telephone dialing systems and/or which will deliver prerecorded messages sent by or on behalf of Instacart, its affiliated companies, and/or Third Party Providers, including but not limited to communications concerning orders placed through your account on the Services.

You also understand and agree that a third party pharmacy and/or Instacart may send you unencrypted SMS messages, push notifications or other electronic notifications relating to prescription drug products that you order through the Services. There is some level of risk that information in such communications could be read by an unintended third party. By using the Services to order a prescription drug product, you explicitly disclaim any liability, and waive and release any claim (to the maximum extent permitted by law), against Instacart, its affiliated companies, and Third Party Providers for any harm or damage arising out of or in connection with any SMS messages, push notifications and/or other electronic notifications. 

3\. Instacart+
==============

Instacart+ (formerly Instacart Express) is a membership program that waives the delivery fee and reduces certain service fees for scheduled deliveries on orders $35 or over (the "Instacart+ Benefits") with each Retailer placed through the Services for a monthly or yearly subscription fee. Instacart+ Benefits may differ on certain Retailers’ white label sites that are powered by Instacart, where available. You acknowledge that your Instacart+ membership does not entitle you to faster delivery times or guaranteed or priority time slots. Service fees (including additional fees and surcharges to help offset specific costs), priority fees, direct-to-consumer shipping fees, long distance fees, alcohol service fees, heavy order fees, special handling fees, taxes and/or tips may still apply. For combinations with other offers, restrictions may apply.  Prescription drug delivery services through Instacart Rx are not eligible for Instacart+ membership benefits.

UNLESS YOU CANCEL, BY DEFAULT (AND WITH PRIOR NOTICE TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW), YOUR INSTACART+ MEMBERSHIP WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW FOR THE AGREED UPON MONTHLY OR ANNUAL TERM, AND THE APPLICABLE MEMBERSHIP FEE WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY CHARGED TO YOU AT THE TIME OF RENEWAL WITH AN ACTIVE  PAYMENT METHOD ON FILE IN YOUR ACCOUNT. The billing date will depend on the type of subscription that you choose when you sign-up for an Instacart+ membership (monthly or yearly) and will be charged within 24 hours on the billing date indicated on your “Your Instacart+ Membership” page. In certain circumstances, your billing date may change. For instance, if we are unable to successfully charge your card for the Instacart+ membership fee on a given day (e.g., a Federal holiday or technical failures). Instacart+ membership fees are fully earned upon payment. 

If your payment details change, your card or other payment method provider may provide us with updated payment details. We may use these new details or details from other payment methods on file in order to help prevent any interruption to your Instacart+ membership. If you do not want to have your card or other payment method automatically updated, you can opt out of these services by contacting your financial institution. If you would like to use a different payment method or if there is a change in payment method, please update your billing information on your “Your Instacart+ Membership” page under the Payment section. All billing information you provide to us must be truthful and accurate and you represent that you are authorized to use the payment method in the manner contemplated here. If the payment method you provided to us for payment is declined or if a payment was not successfully made by you, you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a payment is not successfully made and you do not cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the Services, including without limitation your Instacart+ membership, until we have successfully charged a valid payment method. 

If you do not want your membership to automatically renew, you can cancel your Instacart+ membership at any time using this [link](https://www.instacart.com/store/subscriptions/express_churn_steps) or on your “Your Instacart+ Membership” page by following the “Cancel Membership” link. You may cancel your membership within the first five (5) calendar days of your paid annual membership term or renewed annual subscription, and receive a refund of the Instacart+ membership fee you paid, but only if you have not placed any orders using your Instacart+ membership. When you cancel a monthly membership or if you cancel at any other time, you will not receive a refund, but you can continue to enjoy the benefits of your Instacart+ membership through the end of your paid membership term. Additional instructions on how to manage your Instacart+ membership are available in the Help Center. 

From time to time, Instacart offers some users trial or other promotional memberships to Instacart+. Such trial or promotional memberships are subject to these Terms except as otherwise stated in the promotional offer, including which users are eligible for the promotional memberships. Only one trial or promotional membership is available per household and may not be combined with any other promotion.  Prior to the end of your free trial period or promotional membership period, Instacart will notify you that your free trial period is coming to an end and will automatically charge you the applicable Instacart+ subscription fee to the payment method on file with Instacart. If you cancel your Instacart+ membership before the free trial or promotional membership period has expired, Instacart will not charge you for the subsequent Instacart+ membership term unless you restart your membership. Instacart may change the monthly or annual fee charged for membership at any time, but any such fee change will not apply to current Instacart+ members until such time as their current memberships expire and their memberships are renewed for another term. Where the fee has increased, Instacart will notify you prior to the renewal of your membership of the relevant fee increase.

We may change other terms or conditions applicable to Instacart+ from time to time. Any new or renewed memberships will be subject to the terms of service active at that time and displayed when you sign up for Instacart+. Instacart may also make such changes with respect to current Instacart+ memberships. In that case, Instacart will provide you with notice  of the changes and when those changes will take effect. If you disagree with the changes to your current Instacart+  membership terms of service, you may cancel your membership.  From time to time, Instacart may offer additional benefits or features to Instacart+ subscribers.  These additional benefits or features may not be available to all subscribers and may be subject to additional terms referenced in the offer terms or included in the [Instacart+ Promotional Terms and Conditions](https://www.instacart.com/help/section/360007996832/360041135231). Instacart reserves the right to modify or terminate any additional benefits or features at any time and you agree that such additional perks or benefits are not guaranteed as part of your membership.  

Your Instacart+ membership cannot be transferred or assigned. Instacart reserves the right to accept, refuse, or cancel your Instacart+ membership at any time in its sole discretion.

You acknowledge that Retailers may update pricing in real time, which may not immediately be reflected on In-Store Features and/or result in changes to prices on In-Store Features during your shopping experience. You must alert a Retailer employee if there is any discrepancy between an in-store price and a price displayed on In-Store Features. While we work with Retailers to surface in-store offers, such offers including clearance, single-store and in-store only specials, prices, promotions, offers, coupons and discounts may not be available on In-Store Features. Certain items available in-store may not be available on In-Store Features.

While using Scan & Pay, you acknowledge and warrant that (ii) you will ensure that any products are correctly scanned by you; (ii) for products that are sold by weight, you will ensure that the products are weighed correctly by you; (iii) you will pay for all products prior to leaving the store; and (iv) you will comply with all laws applicable to your use of the Scan & Pay feature.

If you have any issues with scanning or completing your purchase, you must alert a Retailer employee in the store. If Instacart is unable to successfully process your payment for your Scan & Pay order, you must complete your transaction at a register. By using Scan & Pay, you agree to exit the store through the designated Scan & Pay checkout area by scanning your smartphone below the checkout device or such other location as designated by the Retailer, and following the prompts to either proceed to bag check in or exit the store via the designated Scan & Pay exit. You acknowledge that Retailer personnel may conduct checks (including checking of your bags, comparing the items in your bag to your virtual cart, and rescanning some or all items in your bag), or taking other steps to verify proper use of Scan & Pay. You agree that if there is a difference between your scan and any re-scan carried out by Retailer personnel, the re-scan will be decisive. If you scan items incorrectly on multiple occasions, in addition to any of our other rights including under these Terms, we may suspend, disable or terminate your ability to use Scan & Pay and/or the Services. 

Any returns or refunds for products purchased in-store are subject to the Retailer’s refund and return policies, which vary by Retailer. 

Instacart does not own the media or device on which the Services are downloaded, recorded or stored, but Instacart and its licensors retain ownership of the Services and any images scanned by the application. Images of scanned items may be retained by Instacart to improve our Services.

17\. Dispute Resolution & Arbitration Agreement
===============================================

**17.1. Overview of Dispute Resolution Process:** This Section 17 provides for a two-part process for dispute resolution: (1) an informal dispute resolution process directly with Instacart (described in paragraph 17.2, below), and if necessary, (2) a binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) or ADR Services Inc. (“ADR Services”), depending on where you reside. Notwithstanding these provisions, you and Instacart each retain the right to seek resolution of disputes in small claims court as an alternative to arbitration.

**17.2. Mandatory Informal Dispute Resolution:** You and Instacart agree that good-faith informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, low-cost and mutually beneficial outcome. Therefore, before initiating formal proceedings, you and Instacart agree to first attempt to work out any such dispute amicably. The initiating party must give notice to the other party in writing of its, his, or her dispute, including a written description of the dispute. 

For any dispute you initiate, you agree to provide written notice to:

Instacart  
ATTN: Legal Department  
50 Beale Street, Suite 600  
San Francisco, CA 94105

Your written description must be on an individual basis and personally signed by you and not by an attorney, agent, or representative. The notice must also provide at least the following information: your name; the email address associated with your account; a detailed description of the nature and basis of the dispute, including any transaction details; and the specific relief sought and how it was calculated. For any dispute that Instacart raises, we will send our written description of the dispute (including the information listed above), signed by an authorized Instacart representative, to the most recent delivery address associated with your account. The initiating party must allow the other party 60 days to respond and attempt to resolve the dispute amicably before initiating an arbitration or other proceeding per the terms set forth below.

You and Instacart agree that this informal dispute resolution process is a requirement that must be fulfilled prior to initiating an arbitration or small claims proceeding. The applicable statute of limitations period and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled from the time the initiating party sends their written notice through the 60 day period set forth above.

**17.3.  Arbitration Agreement for United States Residents:**  For residents of the United States, if we’re unable to work out a solution amicably, both you and Instacart agree to resolve through binding arbitration, rather than in court, any dispute, controversy, or claim (each, a “Claim”) arising at any time, including but not limited to those arising out of or relating to: (i) these Terms, including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, scope, or enforceability thereof; (ii) access to or use of the Services, including receipt of any advertising or marketing communications and/or any information contained on the Services; (iii) any transactions through, by, or using the Services, including any goods or services purchased or sold through, by, or using the Services and any consumption or use of those goods and services; (iv) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions with Instacart as a consumer; or (v) Third Party Disputes (as defined in Section 17.4 below) (the “Arbitration Agreement”).  

This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the Effective Date of these Terms. 

**17.4. Application to Third Parties:** This Arbitration Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall include any dispute, controversy, or claim brought by or against any third parties where the underlying claims arise out of or relate to your use of the Services or any use of your Instacart user account (“Third Party Disputes”). Third Party Disputes shall include any dispute, controversy, or claim by or against any Retailers, Third-Party Providers, Instacart’s vendors and service providers including without limitation: payment processors, partners assisting in fraud prevention, companies advertising through the Services, partners with whom we work for advertising measurement, attribution and/or analytics, and companies that offer co-branded services or products, as well as your spouses, heirs, third-party beneficiaries and assigns.. For avoidance of doubt, a Claim under this Arbitration Agreement includes all claims or disputes between you and any Retailer arising out of or related to the Services performed under this Agreement and/or services in connection with any white label sites that are powered by Instacart. 

**17.5. Exceptions to Arbitration Agreement:** Notwithstanding this mandatory Arbitration Agreement, you and Instacart each retain the right: (a) to assert claims in small claims court, so long as the claims qualify and the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis; and, (b) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement of a party’s intellectual property rights. If a Claim qualifies for small claims court but a party commences an arbitration proceeding, you and Instacart agree that either party may elect instead to have the Claim resolved in small claims court, and upon written notice of a party's election, the arbitration proceeding will be administratively closed.  Any dispute about whether a Claim qualifies for small claims court shall be resolved by that court, not by an arbitrator.

**17.6. Jury Trial Waiver:** TRIAL BY JURY WAIVER: BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM(S) WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU AND INSTACART ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. 

**17.7. Class, Collective, and Representative Action Waiver:** BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM(S) WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU AND INSTACART ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO BRING, JOIN, OR PARTICIPATE IN, EITHER AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER, IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. YOU ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, UNLESS YOU AND INSTACART OTHERWISE AGREE IN WRITING, ANY ARBITRATION OF ANY CLAIM(S) WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN YOUR FAVOR AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY YOUR INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), AND ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER INSTACART USERS. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS OR ENGAGE IN ANY CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATION. 

**17.8. Arbitration Rules and Governing Law:** The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the “FAA”), governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and preempts all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA is found to not apply to any issue that arises from or relates to this Arbitration Agreement, then that issue shall be resolved under and governed by the law of your state of residence. 

Except as described below for California residents, the arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “Rules”) in effect at the time the arbitration demand is made. The Rules are available at [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/). In the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement shall apply. 

The Parties agree to submit to the jurisdiction of a single neutral arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”) selected in accordance with the Rules. The Arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Instacart. The Arbitrator will have the authority to award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law can award to an individual. The Arbitrator shall follow the applicable law. The Arbitrator’s decision is final and binding on you and Instacart. 

Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, you and Instacart agree that the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether the Terms are unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, or estoppel. 

The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or use the Services, or a location you and Instacart mutually agree upon in writing. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Instacart submit to the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the Rules. 

The Rules will govern the payment of all filing, administrative or arbitrator fees associated with arbitration (“Arbitration Fees”) and each party will be responsible for their own Arbitration Fees under those Rules or to the maximum extent permitted by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may make a request for and will be entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs–including but not limited to any Arbitration Fees–if the Arbitrator finds that the other party has asserted a claim, cross-claim or defense that is groundless in fact or law, brought in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment, or is otherwise frivolous, within the meaning of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 or a state or local equivalent.

For California residents, the arbitration shall be administered by ADR Services, Inc. (“ADR Services”) under its Arbitration Rules (the “ADR Services Rules”) in effect at the time the arbitration demand is made. The ADR Services Rules are available at: [https://www.adrservices.com/services/arbitration-rules/](https://www.adrservices.com/services/arbitration-rules/). In the event of any conflict between the ADR Services Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement shall apply. 

For California residents, the Parties agree to submit to the jurisdiction of a single neutral arbitrator selected in accordance with the ADR Services Rules (the “ADR Arbitrator”). The ADR Arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Instacart. The ADR Arbitrator will have the authority to award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law can award to an individual. The ADR Arbitrator shall follow the applicable law. The ADR Arbitrator’s decision is final and binding on you and Instacart. 

For California residents, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, you and Instacart agree that the ADR Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The ADR Arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether the Terms are unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, or estoppel. 

For California residents, the arbitration will be held in the California county where you live or use the Services, San Francisco, California, or any other location you and Instacart mutually agree upon in writing.

For California residents, the ADR Services Rules will govern the payment of all filing, administrative or arbitrator fees associated with arbitration (“ADR Services Arbitration Fees”), currently summarized on ADR Services website at [https://www.adrservices.com/rate-fee-schedule/](https://www.adrservices.com/rate-fee-schedule/), except that Instacart will reimburse you at the conclusion of the arbitration for any ADR Services Arbitration Fees that you pay in excess of the cost to file the dispute in a court of competent jurisdiction in the location of the arbitration.  Any dispute about the amount or payment of this reimbursement shall be resolved by the Arbitrator.  If the Arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay ADR Services Arbitration Fees and you cannot obtain a fee waiver from ADR Services, Instacart will pay such fees for you. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may make a request for and will be entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs–including but not limited to any ADR Services Arbitration Fees–if the Arbitrator finds that the other party has asserted a claim, cross-claim or defense that is groundless in fact or law, brought in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment, or is otherwise frivolous, within the meaning of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 or a state or local equivalent.

**17.9. Opt-out of Mandatory Arbitration:** You can reject and opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement within 30 days of first accepting these Terms by emailing Instacart at [arbitration-opt-out@instacart.com](mailto:arbitration-opt-out@instacart.com) with your first and last name and the email address associated with your account and stating your intent to opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement. Note that opting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect any other part of these Terms, including the provisions regarding controlling law or in which courts any disputes must be brought. 

**17.10. Changes to Agreement to Arbitrate:** If Instacart changes this Section 17 after the date you last accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject that change by sending us written notice via email as set forth above, within 30 days of the date the change is effective. Rejecting a new change, however, does not revoke or alter your prior consent or any earlier agreements to arbitrate any dispute between you and Instacart and/or its Retailers or other Third Parties identified in Section 17.4. 

**17.11 Severance of Arbitration Agreement:** If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall be severed. Severance of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall have no impact on the remaining provisions of the Arbitration Agreement, which shall remain in force, or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Class, Collective, Representative Action Waiver above is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it would prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction. All other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement shall be arbitrated under its terms, and the parties agree that litigation of any dispute regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. 

**17.12. Survival of Arbitration Agreement:** Except as otherwise provided in this Section 17, this Arbitration Agreement will survive any termination of the Terms or of your access to the Services, including under Section 18 or otherwise.  This Arbitration Agreement will continue to apply even if you or we close your Instacart account.

18\. Termination
================

You can stop using the Services at any time and without notice to us. Similarly, Instacart may terminate access to the Services to you or any other users or stop offering all or part of the Services at any time without notice.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, these Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware for residents of the United States and by the laws of the Province of Ontario for residents of Canada (except Quebec), without respect to its conflicts of laws principles, except the Arbitration Agreement, which is governed by the laws outlined in Section 17 of these Terms. To the extent permitted by applicable law, any claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or use of the Services that are not subject to Section 17 (Dispute Resolution & Arbitration Agreement) of these Terms shall be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts of New Castle County, Delaware, USA, for the residents of the United States, and the courts of competent jurisdiction in the City of Toronto for residents of Canada (except Quebec), and you and Instacart consent to the personal jurisdiction of those courts.

20\. Entire Agreement & Severability
====================================

These Terms, subject to any amendments, modifications, or additional agreements you enter into with Instacart, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Instacart with respect to the Services and any use of the Services. If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid by a court competent jurisdiction, that provision only will be limited to the minimum extent necessary and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. 

21\. No Waiver
==============

Instacart’s failure to monitor or enforce a provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of its right to do so in the future with respect to that provision, any other provision, or these Terms as a whole. 

22\. Assignment
===============

You may not assign any of your rights, licenses, or obligations under these Terms. Any such attempt at assignment by you shall be void. Instacart may assign its rights, licenses, and obligations under these Terms without limitation. 

23\. Changes to the Terms

We may make changes to these Terms from time to time. When Instacart does so, Instacart will post the most current version of the Terms on Instacart’s website and, if a revision to the Terms is material, Instacart will notify you of the new Terms (for example, by email or a notification on the Services). Changes to these terms will not apply retroactively. If you do not agree to the modified terms, you should discontinue your use of the Services.
