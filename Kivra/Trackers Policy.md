=====================================

### and Other Use of Personal Data on Kivra's Websites

On Kivra's websites (i.e., [kivra.se](https://kivra.se/) and all subdomains of the logged-in mode on our site, [kivra.com](https://kivra.com/)) and in Kivra's apps, cookies, SDKs, and similar technologies (“tracking technology”) are used, which involve data being stored on or retrieved from your mobile phone, computer, and similar devices. Here you will find information about why Kivra uses tracking technology, what it means for you, and the choices you can make if you do not want us to use certain tracking technologies.

### **About Tracking Technology**

Kivra uses tracking technology for two reasons: Either the technology is necessary to provide our services, or it is an effective way for Kivra to analyze and improve the user experience of our services. According to the law (2022:482) on electronic communication, you have the right to receive information about which tracking technologies are used on a website you visit or in an app you use. You also have the right to information about how and why tracking technology is used. The provider of the website or app also needs to obtain your consent to use tracking technology that is not necessary to provide a service you have requested to use. If the use of a tracking technology involves the collection of personal data about you, the General Data Protection Regulation applies to the collection and use of your personal data. This means that you also have certain rights and are entitled to certain information in relation to how your personal data is used. Kivra fulfills its obligations under the Electronic Communications Act and the General Data Protection Regulation by: - Informing you that tracking technology is used when you visit our websites or use one of our apps. - Allowing you to choose whether to consent to our use of tracking technology that is not necessary to provide you with the service you are going to use. - Providing you with this information. - Providing you with our [data protection information.](https://kivra.se/sv/privat/dataskyddsinformation)

If you want to read more about tracking technology in general, and what rights you have regarding the use of such technology, you can read more on the [Swedish Post and Telecom Authority's website](https://www.pts.se/sv/privat/internet/integritet/kakor-cookies/) and the [Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection's website.](https://www.imy.se/privatperson/dataskydd/informationssakerhet/sa-surfar-du-mer-anonymt/)

### Tracking Technology in Kivra's Apps

When you use Kivra's app for iOS or Android, data is placed in the local storage space of your device, either by us or by a third party on our behalf. The data remains in your device until you or we (ourselves or through the third party) remove it, or until you uninstall the app. Using the data, certain data points are collected about your installation of the app and how it is used.

Necessary Functions We use the following tracking technologies to perform functions that are necessary to provide our services through the app: - [Firebase Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/products/crashlytics?gclid=CjwKCAiA7dKMBhBCEiwAO_crFPvE3Bu7wxVmsZjvqCBA8yBUb31zCQCdlTGvLNKFi99N2nL04cLirBoCXGMQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds): Used to detect and analyze errors and crashes in the apps. - [Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging): Used to send notifications, such as reminders, messages about a new shipment being available, or messages about an update being available. - **Braze**: Used to send notifications, such as reminders, messages about a new shipment being available, or messages about an update being available. Also used to manage your consents in the service, e.g., to remember whether you have said yes or no to tracking technology, and for temporary service messages, e.g., messages about ongoing maintenance of the service.

Parts of the data collected are only stored temporarily on your device, while other data is stored as long as you have the Kivra app installed. Kivra uses data collected from your device via necessary tracking technologies for varying lengths of time depending on the exact purpose of the technology in question, but at most for as long as you are a user of Kivra's services. If you terminate your use of Kivra's services, Kivra will either anonymize the collected data or ensure that the collected data is deleted as soon as possible, and at the latest within 180 days.

Analysis When you use Kivra's app for iOS or Android, you will be asked if you consent to Kivra collecting information about how you use the app for analysis. If you choose to give such consent, we use the following tracking technology: - [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/): This tracking technology is used to analyze how Kivra's users interact with Kivra's apps. The analysis consists partly of understanding at a high level who our users are, for example, which device models and operating systems most users have and in which countries most users are located. It also involves examining how users generally interact with various features in Kivra's apps, for example, if/how users press a certain button or if/how users read a certain notification. The analyses are used by Kivra's product development team to understand which features need to be developed and improved, and thereby to improve the user experience in our apps.

Parts of the data collected are stored only temporarily on your device, while other data is stored as long as you have the Kivra app installed. Kivra uses data collected from your device through tracking technologies for analytical purposes for varying durations depending on the specific purpose of the technology in question, but for no longer than 18 months from the time the data is collected. If you terminate your use of Kivra's services, collected data will be deleted within 2 months.

Personalization When you use Kivra's app for iOS or Android, you will be asked if you consent to Kivra collecting information about how you use the app for personalization. If you give such consent, we use the following tracking technology:

\- Braze

This tracking technology is used to provide you with a more personalized experience of the app based on how you use it, for example, by sending notifications or showing you relevant messages in the app.

Your Choices Regarding Our Use of Tracking Technology in the Apps You cannot opt out of necessary functions, as they are essential for us to provide the services in our apps.

If you do not want Kivra to use tracking technology for analytics or personalization, you can either choose not to consent to it the first time you log into the app, or later withdraw your consent via your settings in the app. Kivra will then stop collecting data for these purposes and will delete data we have collected for this purpose within 6 months. Withdrawing your consent does not affect the legality of the processing carried out before you revoked your consent.

How to change your settings: If you are using Kivra's app for iOS: Go to the app's settings. Go to More, select Settings, and then Tracking Technology. If you are using Kivra's app for Android: Go to Menu, select App Settings, and then Tracking Technology.

### Tracking Technology on Kivra's Websites

Essential Functions When you visit Kivra's websites, Kivra places data in the local storage space of your device. This is done to perform the following functions necessary to provide the websites: - Customize the websites according to choices you have made, such as opting to close information from Kivra on the websites (i.e., ensuring that you do not need to see that information again), choosing to read the website in a particular language, or adjusting the color theme of the website. - Ensure security and functionality of the websites, in terms of keeping you logged in and in the correct version of the website. The technologies that control logged-in mode and website version are only stored for a session, i.e., until you close your web browser.

Technologies that customize the websites according to choices you have made on kivra.se are stored in your web browser until you delete them - see the section "Your Choices Regarding Our Use of Tracking Technology on Websites" below.

The technology that customizes the websites according to choices you have made for the logged-in mode on kivra.com is stored for up to one year unless you choose to clear them via your web browser - see the section "Your Choices Regarding Our Use of Tracking Technology on Websites" below.

When you visit Kivra's websites, Kivra also collects certain data via your web browser to: Display the websites. Detect and investigate errors and crashes on the websites. Kivra stores this data for up to 45 days to detect and investigate errors and security threats against the websites.

Personalization

When you visit Kivra's websites in logged-in mode, you will be asked if you consent to Kivra collecting information about how you use the service for personalization. If you give such consent, we use the following tracking technology:

\- Braze

This tracking technology is used to give you a more personalized experience of the service based on how you use it.

Use of Plausible on [kivra.se](https://kivra.se/sv/privat) On [kivra.se](https://kivra.se/sv/privat), Kivra uses the [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/) tool to analyze on an anonymized level how visitors interact with and come to the website. Plausible is not a tracking technology according to the law on electronic communication as no such technology is set on your device but has similar purposes and is therefore described here anyway. The analysis includes, for example, the number of users, through which posts and which channel they found the website, the most visited pages on the website, and the times when the website has the most visitors.

The analyses are used by Kivra's product development team to understand which parts of the website need to be developed and improved, and thus to improve the user experience on the website. They are also used by Kivra's marketing team to understand which activities in social media (i.e., ads and posts) generate the most traffic to the websites. In the use of Plausible Analytics, Kivra (via its supplier Plausible Insights OÜ) collects data about visitors' User agent and IP address but anonymizes these data immediately, as described [here](https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics). It is therefore not possible to track individual visitors between different days, devices, or websites.

Your Choices Regarding Our Use of Tracking Technology on Websites You can turn off and receive warnings about tracking technology in your web browser by changing your browser's settings. Through the browser, you can also delete previously stored tracking technology.

If you choose to turn off tracking technology, it may result in you not having access to all features on Kivra's websites, and your user experience on the websites may be impaired.
