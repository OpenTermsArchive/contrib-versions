General Terms and Conditions for the Service
============================================

**Effective from 2025-08-14 and until further notice.**  
  

_Kivra is updating its terms and conditions to allow you to share individual details from your digital mailbox to different recipients. The update comes as we launch a new service for tickets that you can easily show and have scanned at the entrance to your next event._

1\. General
-----------

These general terms and conditions apply when Kivra Sverige AB, corporate ID number 556917-3544, or another company within the same group as Kivra Sverige AB ("Kivra") provides individuals ("User/You") with one or more services and features ("the Service"), including but not limited to a digital mailbox for receiving, managing, transferring, and storing digital messages, receipts, and other documents ("Content"), as well as any other features and services that Kivra may offer from time to time ("Additional Services"). The term Service also includes Additional Services unless otherwise expressly stated in these general terms and conditions or in the specific conditions for the Additional Service in question. To access such Additional Services, you must accept the specific conditions that apply to the Additional Service. The specific conditions and any other written agreements concerning the Service and Additional Services between you and Kivra, together with these general terms and conditions, constitute the agreement between you and Kivra ("the Agreement").

By choosing to register to use the Service, you also agree to follow these general terms and conditions and any other rules and instructions that Kivra may publish via the Service from time to time. You are also obliged to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and governmental decisions when using the Service.

2\. The Service
---------------

**2.1 Registration**

You register for the Service by applying for an account with Kivra through any of the registration options that Kivra offers from time to time.

All individuals with a Swedish personal identification number and e-identification supported by Kivra can apply for an account registration with Kivra. Your application for account registration will be approved by Kivra provided that you are at least 18 years old or if your registration can be done in a manner approved by your parent/guardian.

If you have a sole proprietorship, you will also receive electronic correspondences (see definition under section 2.3 below) to your sole proprietorship in your digital mailbox. The reason is that the organization number in these cases is the same as your personal identification number.

An agreement on the Service is considered to have been entered into between you and Kivra once the registration is completed, and the account is approved. The Service is free of charge for you as a User.

**2.2 Access**

Access to the Service is provided through any of the access options that Kivra informs about via the Service from time to time.

**2.3 Receiving Electronic Correspondences**

The Service means that Kivra, after approved registration of your account, among other things, receives digital messages and dispatches including invoices and digital receipts ("Electronic Correspondences") to your digital mailbox from companies, organizations, authorities, municipalities, and others who have chosen to join Kivra ("Senders").

To be able to receive Electronic Correspondences from authorities and municipalities, you must also register as a user of the service Mina Meddelanden, see the description of the terms at [digg.se](https://www.digg.se/). By being connected to Mina Meddelanden, you agree to receive Electronic Correspondences from authorities and municipalities that are connected to or will connect to Mina Meddelanden.

Kivra continuously informs Senders that you wish to receive Electronic Correspondences in your digital mailbox. You can at any time choose not to receive Electronic Correspondences from one or more Senders via settings in the Service. You can also choose not to receive digital receipts in your digital mailbox via settings in the Service. After such a notification, you may continue to receive Electronic Correspondences from the concerned Sender for up to ten (10) days and digital receipts for up to three (3) days.

**2.4 Registered Letters**

The Service allows you to receive Letters where the Sender receives a receipt when you choose to open the Letter (“Registered Letters”). The Sender is responsible for how long Registered Letters are available for you to open.

**2.5 Uploads**

You can also upload Content to the Service. The number of Contents that can be uploaded is limited as stated in the Service.

**2.6 Folders**

You can organize Content in folders and collaborate with other users by creating shared folders. Which Content can be organized and shared in folders is stated in the Service.

**2.7 Payments**

In the Service, you can make payments of invoices and bills delivered as Electronic Correspondences to your digital mailbox. You can also upload invoices yourself and make them payable in the Service. Kivra then interprets the Content through text recognition and suggests what information should be entered as payment details. You are responsible for ensuring that the information is correct before proceeding with the payment.

Which payment methods and payment options can be used are stated when you choose to pay in the Service and may vary over time. To be able to use certain payment methods, you may need to accept terms from the payment service provider.

It is the payment service provider, and not Kivra, that is responsible for initiating or carrying out the payment in accordance with its terms and your instructions. You are responsible for ensuring that the information you provide when making a payment is correct and up-to-date and for

ensuring that invoices are paid on time. Kivra is not responsible for any additional costs that arise due to your late or non-payments.

**2.8 Offers**

In the Service, you can choose to receive marketing ("Offers") from Senders. The Sender is responsible for the content of the Offer and for how long it is available to you. You choose yourself which Senders you want to receive Offers from and can at any time choose to opt-out of Offers from Senders through settings in the Service.

**2.9 Forms**

In the Service, you can choose to respond to questionnaires ("Forms") from Senders. The Sender is responsible for the content of the Form and how long it is available to you.

**2.10 Sharing Content**

In the Service, you may choose to share Content and individual data with a third party ("Recipient"). You choose which Recipients you wish to share your Content or data with. The recipient is responsible for informing you of the purpose of the sharing and for the handling of your Content or data after sharing.

**2.11 Translations**

In the Service, you may choose to translate Content into different languages. You choose which Content you wish to translate. Kivra is not responsible for the accuracy of the translation.

**2.12 Authorization**

Within the framework of the Service, you can choose to share your digital mailbox with another user, thereby giving this person read and management rights, for example, to be able to pay your invoices. To access your digital mailbox, however, this user must log in with e-identification and accept the sharing. You can revoke the sharing at any time.

Digital receipts are not covered by the possibility to share your digital mailbox. However, you can manage your digital receipts according to the functionality that is offered in the Service from time to time. Among other things, you can choose to forward digital receipts to one or more systems, for example, for expense management.

Folders are also not covered by the possibility to share your digital mailbox. Instead, you can give other users access to Content by creating shared folders.

**2.13 Kivra's communication with you**

Kivra communicates with you via, among other things, email, SMS, push notifications, and Electronic Correspondences. You can choose to opt-out of notifications via email and push notifications through settings in the Service. You can also choose to opt-out of marketing via email through a link in the email message itself. Communication regarding the Service is considered an integrated part of the Service, which means it cannot be opted out of. It is also not possible to opt out of Kivra as a Sender in the Service.

**2.14 Receiving and responsibility for Electronic Correspondences**

An Electronic Correspondence is considered to have been received by you when it has been made available to you in your digital mailbox.

Senders are responsible for the content of the Electronic Correspondences.

You are responsible, in the same way as for physical correspondences, for reviewing the content of Electronic Correspondences.

**2.15 Storage**

Content and your account history are stored for as long as you have an approved account registered with Kivra.

During this time, you are responsible for which Content you choose to delete. Digital receipts, however, are automatically deleted after eight (8) years unless you choose an extended storage period. The Content that is deleted will no longer be available to you.

Upon suspension or termination of the Service according to section 11 below, all Content, as well as your account history stored within the framework of the Service, will be deleted after twenty (20) days.
