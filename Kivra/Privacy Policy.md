Privacy notice
==============

Here we have gathered information about how we process your personal data. This data protection information is effective from 2025-07-04.

### **We protect your privacy**

On this page, we explain how Kivra handles your personal data when you use Kivra's services or otherwise interact with Kivra. You also receive information about your rights and how you can exercise them. 

To make it easier for you to find the information you are interested in, we have divided the page into a number of headings. You can click on the various headings in the list on the right to go directly to the section you are looking for.

The terms used in this data protection information have the same meaning as in Kivras [terms](https://kivra.se/sv/om-oss/om-kivra/villkor). When we talk about Kivra, we mean Kivra Sweden AB (org no. 556917-3544). If you are looking for a job at Kivra, it refers instead to Kivra AB (org no. 556840-2266). 

### **1\. About the processing of personal data**

Personal data is all information that can be directly or indirectly linked to a living natural person. Examples of personal data are name, e-mail address, telephone number, social security number, IP address and account number.

Most of us want to be able to control who we share our personal data with, and how it is used. For that reason, there are special laws and regulations on how companies and other actors may process personal data, so-called data protection legislation. Examples of data protection legislation are the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Data protection legislation governs how companies and other actors may process personal data and what rights individuals have when their personal data is processed. Processing of personal data is basically any use of personal data - such as collecting, creating, analyzing, sharing, and deleting personal data. 

Most obligations under data protection legislation fall on the person responsible for personal data. A personal data controller is an actor, for example a company, which decides for which purposes personal data shall be processed and how the processing shall take place. 

In certain situations, personal data controllers can hire a so-called personal data assistant. A personal data processor is an actor who is tasked with processing personal data on behalf of the personal data controller. A personal data assistant may only process personal data according to instructions from the personal data controller, and may never use the data for other purposes.

### **2\. Is Kivra a personal data controller or a personal data assistant?**

Kivra processes personal data both in the role of personal data controller and as personal data assistant for others. Sections 3-8 of this data protection information describe what applies when Kivra processes your personal data as a data controller. If you want to get a complete picture of which treatments it refers to **see section 3** below. 

Below is a description of the most important examples when Kivra processes your personal data as a personal data processor:

* When Kivra conveys E-mails, Forms or Offers to you, it is the Sender who is the personal data controller for the processing, and Kivra is the personal data assistant to the Sender. If you want information about how your personal data is processed during the mediation, we refer you to the Sender who is responsible for the shipment in question.
    
* When an e-mail is in your mailbox in Kivra, responsibility for personal data is transferred from the Sender to you. Kivra is then your personal data assistant. This is because Kivra only processes personal data according to your instructions and purposes. Kivra has no own purpose in processing your personal data except to provide the Services for you. If you are a private person who only uses personal data for your own, personal purposes (the so-called "household exception"), the GDPR does not apply. This means that you do not have to comply with the requirements set out in the regulation. However, Kivra is still obliged to fulfill its obligations as a personal data processor, for example by only processing personal data according to your instructions. For that reason, Kivra signs a personal data assistant agreement with all Users, even if you as a User are not bound by the requirements of the regulation. The purpose is that you should always feel secure that your personal data is handled in a safe and legal manner, in accordance with your instructions. What obligations Kivra has when we act as a personal data processor is shown in your [personal data processing agreement with Kivra](https://kivra.se/sv/om-oss/om-kivra/villkor/pub-avtal).
    
* When Kivra sends an SMS that you can access a credit report copy, it is the credit reporting company that created the credit report and is the personal data controller for the processing. Kivra is a personal data assistant for the credit reporting company. If you want information about how your personal data is processed at the brokerage, we refer you to the credit information company that created the credit information. You can find general information about how your personal data is processed in connection with credit reporting companies sending credit report copies [here](https://faq.kivra.se/hc/sv/articles/22936719743901-Vem-%C3%A4r-personuppgiftansvarig-f%C3%B6r-SMS-utskicket-g%C3%A4llande-en-kreditupplysning). 
    

### **3\. What does Kivra use your personal data for?**

The tables below describe:

1. For what purposes we use your personal data.
    
2. Which categories of personal data we use for each purpose.
    
3. Where we have received the personal data from, i.e. whether we have received the data from you or from another source.
    
4. What legal basis we have for our processing of your personal data. Without a legal basis, we may not process your personal data.
    
5. How long we use and save your personal data for each purpose.
    
6. About and with whom we share your personal data.

**3.2 When you represent a company or an organization**

**_3.2.1 When managing an account for a business_**

_Here we describe how your personal data is processed when you, as an authorized representative, create and administer an account for the company or organization you represent (in accordance with our terms a_ **_"Business User"_**_). The information covers, among other things, how we verify your eligibility and handle any payments._

**Note:** In order to represent a Business user in Kivra, you need a private Kivra account. This means that the treatments described in section 3.1 (When you use Kivra as a private person) also apply to you. This section describes the treatments that are added specifically because of your role as a representative.

### **4\. Is your personal data processed in other countries outside the EU/EEA?**

As a general rule, your personal data is only processed in Sweden or within the EU/EEA. However, there are situations where Kivra has chosen to process your personal data using services and tools that store and process your personal data outside the EU/EEA, see section 3. 

In that case, Kivra only transfers personal data to countries outside the EU/EEA which, according to the European Commission, have an adequate level of protection. You will find more information on which countries are considered to have an adequate level of protection [EU Commission website](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en).

If the processing takes place in the USA, Kivra ensures that the receiving party is part of the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) developed between the EU and the USA. Kivra only has US subcontractors who have chosen to join the framework and Kivra always contracts and verifies that Kivra's subcontractors include DPF in their data protection information. Furthermore, Kivra always checks that personal data processing that the subcontractor specifies in their data protection information also includes the personal data processing that we want them to carry out on Kivra's behalf. You can find the list of which companies are connected to DPF at [US Department of Commerce website](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/participant-search).

### **5\. What rights do you have?**

Under the various subheadings below, you can read about the rights you have when Kivra is the data controller for the processing of your personal data. For information on how to exercise your rights, see section 8 below. 

#### **5.1 Right to information**

Every time Kivra collects personal data about you, you have the right to information about how we process your personal data. You also have the right to be informed if we plan to process your personal data for any purpose other than that for which the data was first collected. 

We provide you with such information, and other information we believe is important to you, through this privacy notice. We also provide you with information about how we process your personal data by answering any questions you may ask us. 

#### **5.2 Right to access** 

You have the right to receive confirmation of whether Kivra is processing personal data about you, and in such cases to also have access to the personal data we process, together with certain information about the processing itself. 

You get access to your personal data by giving you a copy of the personal data we process, in a so-called register extract. It is free of charge to obtain a copy of your register statement. Should you request additional copies, Kivra may charge a reasonable administrative fee.  As a rule, we provide you with your register extract in the Service. The register extract can also be sent encrypted by e-mail, or to your civil registry address, if you prefer or if you do not have a Kivra account.

#### **5.3 Right to rectification** 

You have the right to request that we correct incorrect information about you, and that we supplement incomplete information about you. 

If you change your phone number, email address or other contact information, you can update such information yourself by logging into the Service and adjusting your account settings. 

If you apply for a job or internship, you can adjust or change information you have provided to us in connection with your application in the recruitment platform that Kivra uses. You can also contact us to get help correcting incorrect information about you and if you want us to supplement incomplete information about you. 

#### **5.4 Right to have your personal data deleted**

Under certain circumstances, you have the right to have the personal data Kivra processes about you deleted. This is the case, for example, if it is no longer necessary for Kivra to process the data for the purpose for which we collected them; if you withdraw your consent; if you have objected to the processing and there are no legitimate, weightier reasons for the processing; or if the processing concerns direct marketing and you object to the direct marketing. (Regarding the separate right to object, see the next subsection.)

If you want Kivra to delete all of your personal data covered by your right to have your data deleted, you must first close your account with Kivra. Kivra will then delete personal data about you in accordance with what is described under section 6.4 above. 

The right to have personal data deleted is not absolute, but applies when the legal conditions for deletion are met. Examples of situations when those conditions are not met, and we will not delete your data, are if the data is necessary to process for the legal purpose for which it was collected, or if we have to retain the data according to the law.

If you have applied for a job or internship at Kivra, you can delete your data at any time in the recruitment platform that Kivra uses, you can also contact us for help in deleting your personal data. 

#### **5.5 Right to object to processing**

You have the right to object at any time to processing that Kivra carries out with your personal data against the background of a so-called balancing of interests. In section 3 above, you can read about when Kivra processes your personal data with balancing of interests as a legal basis.

If you object to such processing, Kivra may no longer carry out the processing, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate reasons for the processing that outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms; or if it is for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.

You also have the right to object to us using your personal data for direct marketing. If you notify us that you no longer wish to receive direct marketing from us, we will stop sending you such marketing. We will also stop processing your personal data for that purpose. 

#### **5.6 Right to restriction of processing**

You have the right to request that we limit our processing of your personal data. Your right to restrict the processing of your personal data applies if you believe that information about you is incorrect; that the processing is against the law (but you object to the deletion of the data); that we no longer need the data for the purpose for which it was processed (but you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims); or if you have exercised your right to object to our processing of your personal data. 

If Kivra's processing of your personal data is restricted, we will (with the exception of storage) only process the data with your consent or to establish, assert or defend legal claims, to protect the rights of another natural or legal person, or for reasons related to important public interest. 

#### **5.7 Right to move your personal data to another recipient (data portability)**

You have the right to receive certain personal data about you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, so-called data portability. You have the right to transfer such data to another recipient, for example another service. If it is technically possible, as determined by Kivra, you also have the right to request that Kivra transfer the data directly to the other recipient.

The right to data portability only covers personal data concerning you, which you yourself have provided to Kivra, which Kivra processes automatically, and which you have agreed to provide to Kivra or which you have provided to Kivra due to an agreement.
