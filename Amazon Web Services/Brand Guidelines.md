“Licensor” means Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL (if the geographic location associated with your AWS or program account is any country within Europe, the Middle East, or Africa (“EMEA”)) or Amazon Web Services, Inc. (if the geographic location associated with your AWS or program account is any country outside of EMEA).  

**3\. License:**

**(a) AWS Customers.** Provided that you are an AWS customer in good standing with a current and valid account for use of the Services (as defined in the [AWS Customer Agreement](https://aws.amazon.com/agreement/) or other agreement with us governing your use of the Services (the “Agreement”)) and that you comply at all times with the Agreement, Licensor grants you a non-exclusive, royalty-free, and revocable license to use the Powered by AWS Logo solely to (i) identify Your Content (as defined in the Agreement) as using the Services; or (ii) identify software tools or applications that you create and distribute that are intended for use in connection with the Services. Your license to use the Powered by AWS Logo will automatically terminate and you must immediately stop using the logo if at any time (i) the Agreement is terminated or you otherwise cease to be an AWS customer in good standing; or (ii) Your Content no longer uses any of the Services, or your software cannot be used with any of the Services, as applicable.

**(b) AWS Partners.** Provided that you are a participant (“AWS Partner”) in the AWS Partner Network Program (“APN Program”) and that you comply at all times with the [AWS Partner Network Terms and Conditions](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/terms-and-conditions/) (“APN Terms”), Licensor grants you a non-exclusive, royalty-free, and revocable license to (i) reproduce, display, and distribute the Program Content (as defined in the APN Terms) (other than the Partner Logo (as defined in the APN Terms)) solely for the purpose of marketing our Services to your customers, and (ii) if you are eligible as described on the APN Site (as defined in the APN Terms), display the current version of the Partner Logo on your website and in your own offline materials in accordance with the [AWS Marks for APN Guidelines](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/logo-guidelines/) and the APN Program marketing tools available under the APN Program, solely to identify your participation in the APN Program. You may not modify, alter, or otherwise create derivative works of any Program Content unless expressly permitted by us in writing. Your license to use the Program Content will automatically terminate and you must immediately stop using the Program Content if at any time you cease to be an AWS Partner.

Provided that you have entered into an AWS Solution Provider Addendum, AWS Distributor Addendum, or AWS Distribution Seller Addendum (each, an “Addendum”) with us, Licensor also grants you a non-exclusive, royalty-free, and revocable license during the term of the Addendum to use the AWS Marks in and on the Advertising Materials (as defined in the Addendum), and subject to the terms of the Addendum, including applicable Solution Provider Program Terms, Distributor Program Terms, or Distribution Seller Program Terms. We may, by giving you notice, revoke (in whole or in part) the foregoing license immediately upon any non-compliance with the Addendum. You may transfer the Advertising Materials to any agent selling Authorized Services (as defined in the Addendum) on your behalf for such agent’s use in the resale of Authorized Services. Ensure the first or most prominent reference to or placement of the AWS Marks is accompanied by the notice below (on the same page and in legible font). Use the following notice anywhere you are advertising your company or describing your services and are specifically featuring us:

“Amazon Web Services resold by \[\[SOLUTION PROVIDER / DISTRIBUTOR / DISTRIBUTION SELLER\] NAME\], an authorized \[solution provider / distributor / distribution seller\] of Amazon Web Services. Amazon Web Services, AWS, and the Powered by AWS logo are trademarks of Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates.”

Without limitation of any provision in the Agreement or any other relevant terms and conditions, agreements, or addendums as described in Section 3, your use of the AWS Marks is at your sole risk and that we have no liability or responsibility in connection your use.

**6\. No Disparagement or Misleading Use.** You may use the AWS Marks only in a manner designed to maintain the highest standard, quality, and reputation that is associated with the AWS Marks.

**12\. Paid Search Ads.** AWS owns and restricts trademark use by third parties on all search engines and will authorize only AWS Partners that have reached validated stage in any of the [AWS Partner Paths](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/paths/) to use AWS Marks in paid search ads.

**16\. Reservation of Rights.** Except for the license specified in Section 3, nothing in the Agreement, these AWS Trademark Guidelines, or any other relevant terms and conditions, agreements, or addendums as described in Section 3 grants or may be deemed to grant you any right, license, title or interest in or to any AWS Mark or any of our or our affiliates’ other trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, product names, service names, legends, other designations, or abbreviations of any of the foregoing, or any of our or our affiliates’ copyright, patent, or other intellectual property rights.
