AWS Trademark Guidelines & License Terms
========================================

#### Last Updated: July 18, 2024

**1\. Introduction.** These AWS Trademark Guidelines (“Guidelines”) apply to your use of AWS Marks pursuant to Section 3 below and/or to any agreement entered into with Amazon Web Services, Inc. or its affiliates (“AWS”) that references and incorporates these Guidelines. The Definitions in Section 2 and Licenses in Section 3 will apply unless you have entered into a written agreement with AWS that contains separate license terms (“Written Agreement”), in which case the terms of your Written Agreement will control to the extent that there is any inconsistency.  

**2\. Definitions.** “AWS Marks” means trademarks, service marks, names, logos, or other designations owned by AWS, including, but not limited to: (i) AWS and the AWS Smile Logo; (ii) the Powered by AWS Logo made available on the [AWS Co-Marketing Tools](https://aws.amazon.com/co-marketing/) page; (iii) the Partner Logo described in Section 3; and (iv) all other names and logos associated with AWS products, services, events, programs, and initiatives (see a non-exhaustive list at Section 17).

“Licensor” means Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL (if the geographic location associated with your AWS or program account or your Written Agreement is any country within Europe, the Middle East, or Africa (“EMEA”)) or Amazon Web Services, Inc. (if the geographic location associated with your AWS or program account or your Written Agreement is any country outside of EMEA).  

**3\. License:**

**(a) AWS Customers.** Provided that you are an AWS customer in good standing with a current and valid account for use of the Services (as defined in the [AWS Customer Agreement](https://aws.amazon.com/agreement/) or other agreement governing your use of the Services (the “Agreement”)) and  subject to your compliance at all times with the Agreement, Licensor grants you a non-exclusive, royalty-free, and revocable license to use the [Powered by AWS Logo](https://aws.amazon.com/co-marketing/) solely to (i) identify Your Content (as defined in the Agreement) as using the Services; or (ii) identify software tools or applications that you create and distribute that are intended for use in connection with the Services. Your license to use the Powered by AWS Logo will automatically terminate and you must immediately stop using the logo if at any time (i) the Agreement is terminated or you otherwise cease to be an AWS customer in good standing; or (ii) Your Content no longer uses any of the Services, or your software cannot be used with any of the Services, as applicable. The Powered by AWS Logo is not available for use in China.

**(b) AWS Partners.** Provided that you are a participant (“AWS Partner”) in the AWS Partner Network Program (“APN Program”) and subject to your compliance at all times with the [AWS Partner Network Terms and Conditions](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/terms-and-conditions/) (“APN Terms”), Licensor grants you a non-exclusive, royalty-free, and revocable license to (i) reproduce, display, and distribute the Program Content (as defined in the APN Terms) (other than the Partner Logo (as defined in the APN Terms)) solely for the purpose of marketing AWS Services to your customers, and (ii) if you are eligible as described on the APN Site (as defined in the APN Terms), display the current version of the Partner Logo on your website and in your own offline materials in accordance with the [AWS Marks for APN Guidelines](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/logo-guidelines/) and the APN Program marketing tools available under the APN Program, solely to identify your participation in the APN Program. You will not modify, alter, or otherwise create derivative works of any Program Content unless expressly permitted by AWS in writing. Your license to use the Program Content will automatically terminate and you must immediately stop using the Program Content if at any time you cease to be an AWS Partner.

Provided that you have entered into an AWS Solution Provider Addendum, AWS Distributor Addendum, or AWS Distribution Seller Addendum (each, an “Addendum”) with AWS and subject to your compliance at all times with such Addendum, Licensor also grants you a non-exclusive, royalty-free, and revocable license during the term of the Addendum to use the AWS Marks identified for your use in and on the Advertising Materials (as defined in the Addendum), and subject to the terms of the Addendum, including applicable Solution Provider Program Terms, Distributor Program Terms, or Distribution Seller Program Terms. AWS may, by giving you notice, revoke (in whole or in part) the foregoing license immediately upon any non-compliance with the Addendum. You may transfer the Advertising Materials to any agent selling Authorized Services (as defined in the Addendum) on your behalf for such agent’s use in the resale of Authorized Services. You will ensure the first or most prominent reference to or placement of the AWS Marks is accompanied by the notice below (on the same page and in legible font). You will use the following notice anywhere you are advertising your company or describing your services and are specifically featuring us: 

“Amazon Web Services resold by \[\[SOLUTION PROVIDER / DISTRIBUTOR / DISTRIBUTION SELLER\] NAME\], an authorized \[solution provider / distributor / distribution seller\] of Amazon Web Services. Amazon Web Services, AWS, and the Powered by AWS logo are trademarks of Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates.” 

Upon termination or expiration of the Addendum or other revocation, your license to use the AWS Marks in and on the Advertising Materials is terminated and you must immediately stop (and ensure all agents immediately stop) using the Advertising Materials. 

**(c) AWS Strategic Collaboration Agreement.** Provided that you have entered into a Strategic Collaboration Agreement (the “SCA”) with AWS and that you comply at all times with the SCA, unless otherwise specified in the SCA, Licensor grants you a non-exclusive, royalty free, and revocable license during the Term (as defined in the SCA) to use the AWS Marks identified for your use in and on AWS-approved Collateral (as defined in the SCA) in furtherance of Initiatives (as defined in the SCA). Upon termination or expiration of the SCA, your license to use the AWS Marks is terminated and you must immediately stop using the AWS Marks. 

**(d)** Except in connection with the transfer of Advertising Materials as described in Section 3(b), you will not transfer, assign or sublicense your license to use the AWS Marks or Program Content. Any use of the AWS Marks or Program Content outside the scope of the foregoing licenses requires Licensor’s prior written permission. 

WITHOUT LIMITATION, YOUR USE OF THE AWS MARKS IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND WE HAVE NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY IN CONNECTION YOUR USE. THIS LICENSE IS PROVIDED AS IS AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.  

**4\. Limitations; Approvals.** You will only use the specific trademarks provided to you by AWS and only in materials that have been approved in advance by AWS. Your permitted use of the AWS Marks is conditioned upon compliance with these Guidelines and any other terms or agreements entered into with AWS. AWS reserves the right to modify these Guidelines and License Terms at any time by posting a revised version on this webpage or by otherwise notifying you. AWS may revoke your right to use AWS Marks at any time. AWS will take appropriate action against any use without permission or any use that does not conform to these Guidelines.  

**5\. No Affiliation or Endorsement; No Dominant Display.** You will not misrepresent or embellish your relationship with AWS. You will not display the AWS Marks in any manner that implies sponsorship or endorsement by AWS other than by using the Marks as specifically authorized by AWS. You will not display any AWS Mark in a way that is larger or more prominent than your own branding in materials associated with your products or services.  

**6\. Quality Control; Manner of Use.** You must use the AWS Marks in a manner that maintains or exceeds the high standard, quality, and reputation associated with AWS. Upon request from AWS, you will provide samples of your materials featuring the AWS Marks sufficient for AWS to confirm compliance with these Guidelines and to ensure your permitted use is of a consistent high quality. If AWS finds that your use is not in compliance, you will make any changes requested by AWS or cease use of the AWS Marks. You will not use the AWS Marks to disparage AWS or its products or services or display the AWS Marks in any manner that is misleading, unfair, defamatory, infringing, libelous, disparaging, obscene, or otherwise objectionable as determined by AWS in its sole discretion. You will not use the AWS Marks in any manner that violates any law or regulation. You will not display any AWS Mark on your website if your website contains or displays adult content or promotes illegal activities, gambling, or the sale of tobacco or alcohol to persons under the age of twenty-one.  

**7\. No Combination.** You will not combine, abbreviate, telescope, or hyphenate AWS Marks with any other words, trademarks, or brand elements. You will not incorporate AWS Marks into the names of your organization, products, or services, or into your trademarks or logos.  

**8\. Amazon One and Just Walk Out.** In connection with your authorized use of the Amazon One or Just Walk Out trademarks (the “Identity and Checkout Names”), you will not (a) use an alteration or play on the Identity and Checkout Names, including by adding, removing, or modifying terms to create your own related name or tagline (example: “ONE STOP,” “JUST WALK,” “WALK OUT,” “JUST WALK OFF,” “SIMPLY WALK OUT,” or “JUST RUN OUT”); or (b) use the Identity and Checkout Names or similar variations descriptively when explaining the technology (“just walk off,” “simply walk out,” or “just pop out”). You will use the terms “technology” or “shopping” when referring to the Identity and Checkout Names in a sentence or other text (example: “AMAZON ONE technology,” “JUST WALK OUT technology,” or “JUST WALK OUT shopping”).  

**9\. Logo Display.** AWS will supply logo images of the AWS Marks for your permitted use. You will not alter the logo images in any manner, including but not limited to changing the proportion, color, or font of the AWS Marks, or adding or removing any elements to or from the images. AWS Marks must appear by themselves, with reasonable spacing between each side of the logo image and other visual, graphic or textual elements. Under no circumstance should the AWS Marks be placed on any background which interferes with the readability or display of the logo images. You will comply with any relevant graphics standards provided by AWS.  

**10\. Trade Dress.** You will not imitate the trade dress or “look and feel” of any AWS website, including without limitation, the branding, color combinations, fonts, graphic designs, product icons, or other elements associated with AWS.

**11\. Domain Names;** **URLs**. You will not register any domain name that contains an AWS Mark, including any variation or modification, or use any AWS Mark in a subdomain. However, you may use AWS Marks in the URL path or subdirectory (Example: www.YourDomain.com/aws) solely for content related to AWS, so long as such use complies with these Guidelines.  

**12\. Exclusive Rights; Goodwill.** You acknowledge that all rights to the AWS Marks are the exclusive property of AWS and all goodwill generated through your use of the AWS Marks will inure solely to the benefit of AWS. Nothing in these Guidelines will be construed as an assignment of any right, title, or interest in the AWS Marks, except for the limited licenses granted herein. You will not take any action that is in conflict with AWS's rights in or ownership of the AWS Marks. You will not attempt to register any trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, other designations that include the AWS Marks.  

**13\. Fair Use.** AWS does not object to fair use of its marks by third parties, so long as the use would not be confusing for customers. Any such use should be in plain text only (no logos) and used to make true factual statements. Fair use does not permit you to state or imply affiliation, sponsorship, or endorsement by AWS. If you want to reference AWS in connection with your own product, service, or event, please use the following format:            

* Format: \[Your Brand or Use Case\] \[relational phrase\] \[AWS Mark\]           
* Example: YourApp for Amazon S3 

Note: You may replace “for” in this example with any of the following relational phrases, so long as the term is accurate when used with the AWS Mark: “for use with”; “with”; “compatible with”; “works with”; “built on”; “built with”; “developed on”; “developed with”; etc.  

**14\. Paid Search Ads.** AWS restricts trademark use by third parties on all search engines and will authorize only AWS Partners that have reached validated stage in any of the [AWS Partner Paths](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/paths/) to use AWS Marks in paid search ads. Contact your APN Partner Development Manager to request authorization.  

**15\. Third Party Publications**. In most cases, AWS does not provide licenses or other authorization for use of AWS content in third party publications, including screenshots, diagrams, code, documentation, or other copyrightable materials. However, AWS does not object to limited fair use of such materials for educational or non-profit purposes.  

**16\. Contact Information.** If you have questions regarding your obligations under these AWS Trademark Guidelines or questions about any AWS Mark, please contact [trademarks@amazon.com](mailto:trademarks@amazon.com).

========================================

#### Last Updated: July 18, 2024

**1\. Introduction.** These AWS Trademark Guidelines (“Guidelines”) apply to your use of AWS Marks pursuant to Section 3 below and/or to any agreement entered into with Amazon Web Services, Inc. or its affiliates (“AWS”) that references and incorporates these Guidelines. The Definitions in Section 2 and Licenses in Section 3 will apply unless you have entered into a written agreement with AWS that contains separate license terms (“Written Agreement”), in which case the terms of your Written Agreement will control to the extent that there is any inconsistency.  

**2\. Definitions.** “AWS Marks” means trademarks, service marks, names, logos, or other designations owned by AWS, including, but not limited to: (i) AWS and the AWS Smile Logo; (ii) the Powered by AWS Logo made available on the [AWS Co-Marketing Tools](https://aws.amazon.com/co-marketing/) page; (iii) the Partner Logo described in Section 3; and (iv) all other names and logos associated with AWS products, services, events, programs, and initiatives (see a non-exhaustive list at Section 17).

“Licensor” means Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL (if the geographic location associated with your AWS or program account or your Written Agreement is any country within Europe, the Middle East, or Africa (“EMEA”)) or Amazon Web Services, Inc. (if the geographic location associated with your AWS or program account or your Written Agreement is any country outside of EMEA).  

**3\. License:**

**(a) AWS Customers.** Provided that you are an AWS customer in good standing with a current and valid account for use of the Services (as defined in the [AWS Customer Agreement](https://aws.amazon.com/agreement/) or other agreement governing your use of the Services (the “Agreement”)) and  subject to your compliance at all times with the Agreement, Licensor grants you a non-exclusive, royalty-free, and revocable license to use the [Powered by AWS Logo](https://aws.amazon.com/co-marketing/) solely to (i) identify Your Content (as defined in the Agreement) as using the Services; or (ii) identify software tools or applications that you create and distribute that are intended for use in connection with the Services. Your license to use the Powered by AWS Logo will automatically terminate and you must immediately stop using the logo if at any time (i) the Agreement is terminated or you otherwise cease to be an AWS customer in good standing; or (ii) Your Content no longer uses any of the Services, or your software cannot be used with any of the Services, as applicable. The Powered by AWS Logo is not available for use in China.

**(b) AWS Partners.** Provided that you are a participant (“AWS Partner”) in the AWS Partner Network Program (“APN Program”) and subject to your compliance at all times with the [AWS Partner Network Terms and Conditions](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/terms-and-conditions/) (“APN Terms”), Licensor grants you a non-exclusive, royalty-free, and revocable license to (i) reproduce, display, and distribute the Program Content (as defined in the APN Terms) (other than the Partner Logo (as defined in the APN Terms)) solely for the purpose of marketing AWS Services to your customers, and (ii) if you are eligible as described on the APN Site (as defined in the APN Terms), display the current version of the Partner Logo on your website and in your own offline materials in accordance with the [AWS Marks for APN Guidelines](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/logo-guidelines/) and the APN Program marketing tools available under the APN Program, solely to identify your participation in the APN Program. You will not modify, alter, or otherwise create derivative works of any Program Content unless expressly permitted by AWS in writing. Your license to use the Program Content will automatically terminate and you must immediately stop using the Program Content if at any time you cease to be an AWS Partner.

Provided that you have entered into an AWS Solution Provider Addendum, AWS Distributor Addendum, or AWS Distribution Seller Addendum (each, an “Addendum”) with AWS and subject to your compliance at all times with such Addendum, Licensor also grants you a non-exclusive, royalty-free, and revocable license during the term of the Addendum to use the AWS Marks identified for your use in and on the Advertising Materials (as defined in the Addendum), and subject to the terms of the Addendum, including applicable Solution Provider Program Terms, Distributor Program Terms, or Distribution Seller Program Terms. AWS may, by giving you notice, revoke (in whole or in part) the foregoing license immediately upon any non-compliance with the Addendum. You may transfer the Advertising Materials to any agent selling Authorized Services (as defined in the Addendum) on your behalf for such agent’s use in the resale of Authorized Services. You will ensure the first or most prominent reference to or placement of the AWS Marks is accompanied by the notice below (on the same page and in legible font).

Amazon Web Services, AWS, and the Powered by AWS logo are trademarks of Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates.” 

Upon termination or expiration of the Addendum or other revocation, your license to use the AWS Marks in and on the Advertising Materials is terminated and you must immediately stop (and ensure all agents immediately stop) using the Advertising Materials. 

**(c) AWS Strategic Collaboration Agreement.** Provided that you have entered into a Strategic Collaboration Agreement (the “SCA”) with AWS and that you comply at all times with the SCA, unless otherwise specified in the SCA, Licensor grants you a non-exclusive, royalty free, and revocable license during the Term (as defined in the SCA) to use the AWS Marks identified for your use in and on AWS-approved Collateral (as defined in the SCA) in furtherance of Initiatives (as defined in the SCA). Upon termination or expiration of the SCA, your license to use the AWS Marks is terminated and you must immediately stop using the AWS Marks. 

**(d)** Except in connection with the transfer of Advertising Materials as described in Section 3(b), you will not transfer, assign or sublicense your license to use the AWS Marks or Program Content.
