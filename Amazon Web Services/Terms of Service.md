AWS Service Terms
=================

#### Last Updated: July 9, 2021

The Service Terms below govern your use of the Services. Capitalized terms used in these Service Terms but not defined below are defined in the [AWS Customer Agreement](https://aws.amazon.com/agreement/) or other agreement with us governing your use of the Services (the “Agreement”). For purposes of these Service Terms, “Your Content” includes any “Company Content” and any “Customer Content,” and “AWS Content” includes “Amazon Properties.”

#### 1\. Universal Service Terms (Applicable to All Services)

**1.1.** You may not transfer outside the Services any software (including related documentation) you obtain from us or third party licensors in connection with the Services without specific authorization to do so.

**1.2.** You must comply with current technical documentation applicable to the Services (including applicable developer guides) posted on the AWS Site.

**1.3.** You will provide information or other materials related to Your Content (including copies of any client-side applications) as reasonably requested by us to verify your compliance with the Agreement. You will reasonably cooperate with us to identify the source of any problem with the Services that we reasonably believe may be attributable to Your Content or any end user materials that you control.

**1.4.** In connection with your use of the Services, you are responsible for maintaining licenses and adhering to the license terms of any software you run. If we reasonably believe any of Your Content violates the law, infringes or misappropriates the rights of any third party, or otherwise violates a material term of the Agreement (including the documentation, the Service Terms, or the Acceptable Use Policy) (“Prohibited Content”), we will notify you of the Prohibited Content and may request that such content be removed from the Services or access to it be disabled. If you do not remove or disable access to the Prohibited Content within 2 business days of our notice, we may remove or disable access to the Prohibited Content or suspend the Services to the extent we are not able to remove or disable access to the Prohibited Content. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may remove or disable access to any Prohibited Content without prior notice in connection with illegal content, where the content may disrupt or threaten the Services or in accordance with applicable law or any judicial, regulatory or other governmental order or request. In the event that we remove Your Content without prior notice, we will provide prompt notice to you unless prohibited by law. We terminate the accounts of repeat infringers in appropriate circumstances.

**1.5.** You will ensure that all information you provide to us via the AWS Site (e.g., information provided in connection with your registration for the Services, requests for increased usage limits) is accurate, complete, and not misleading.

**1.6.** From time to time, we may apply upgrades, patches, bug fixes, or other maintenance to the Services and AWS Content (“Maintenance”). We agree to use reasonable efforts to provide you with prior notice of any scheduled Maintenance (except for emergency Maintenance), and you agree to use reasonable efforts to comply with any Maintenance requirements that we notify you about.

**1.7.** If your Agreement does not include a provision on AWS Confidential Information, and you and AWS do not have an effective non-disclosure agreement in place, then you agree that you will not disclose AWS Confidential Information (as defined in the AWS Customer Agreement), except as required by law.

**1.8.** You may perform benchmarks or comparative tests or evaluations (each, a “Benchmark”) of the Services. If you perform or disclose, or direct or permit any third party to perform or disclose, any Benchmark of any of the Services, you (i) will include in any disclosure, and will disclose to us, all information necessary to replicate such Benchmark, and (ii) agree that we may perform and disclose the results of Benchmarks of your products or services, irrespective of any restrictions on Benchmarks in the terms governing your products or services.

**1.9.** Only the applicable AWS Contracting Party (as defined in the AWS Customer Agreement) will have obligations with respect to each AWS account, and no other AWS Contracting Party has any obligation with respect to such account. The AWS Contracting Party for an account may change as described in the Agreement. Invoices for each account will reflect the AWS Contracting Party that is responsible for that account during the applicable billing period.

If, as of the time of a change of the AWS Contracting Party responsible for your account, you have made an up-front payment for any Services under such account, then the AWS Contracting Party you paid such up-front payment to may remain the AWS Contracting Party for the applicable account only with respect to the Services related to such up-front payment.

**1.10.** When you use a Service, you may be able to use or be required to use one or more other Services (each, an “Associated Service”), and when you use an Associated Service, you are subject to the terms and fees that apply to that Associated Service.

**1.11.** If you process the personal data of End Users or other identifiable individuals in your use of a Service, you are responsible for providing legally adequate privacy notices and obtaining necessary consents for the processing of such data. You represent to us that you have provided all necessary privacy notices and obtained all necessary consents. You are responsible for processing such data in accordance with applicable law.

**1.12.** If you have been charged for a Service for a period when that Service was unavailable (as defined in the applicable Service Level Agreement for each Service), you may request a Service credit equal to any charged amounts for such period.

**1.13.** If you are a customer that is subject to the French Politique générale de sécurité des systems d’information de santé (PGSSI-S), you agree that your use of the Services complies with the PGSSI-S.

**1.14.** Data Protection.  

**1.14.1** These Service Terms incorporate the [AWS GDPR Data Processing Addendum](https://d1.awsstatic.com/legal/aws-gdpr/AWS_GDPR_DPA.pdf) (“DPA”), when the GDPR applies to your use of the AWS Services to process Customer Data (as defined in the DPA).The DPA is effective as of 25 May 2018 and replaces and supersedes any previously agreed data processing addendum between you and AWS relating to the Directive 95/46/EC.

**1.14.2** These Service Terms incorporate the [AWS Supplementary Addendum](https://d1.awsstatic.com/Supplementary_Addendum_to_the_AWS_GDPR_DPA.pdf) to the DPA, when the GDPR applies to your use of the AWS Services to process Customer Data.

**1.14.3** These Service Terms incorporate the [AWS CCPA Terms](https://d1.awsstatic.com/legal/aws-ccpa/AWS_CCPA_Terms.pdf) (“CCPA Terms”), when the CCPA applies to your use of the AWS Services to process Personal Information (as defined in the CCPA Terms).

**1.15.** Following closure of your AWS account, we will delete Your Content in accordance with the Documentation.

**1.16.** Your receipt and use of any Promotional Credits is subject to the [AWS Promotional Credit Terms & Conditions](https://aws.amazon.com/awscredits/).

**1.17.** Payment Currency

**1.17.1** AWS provides a Service that enables payment in certain currencies (“Payment Currency”) other than United States dollars when you purchase certain Services from AWS (the “Currency Service”). When you purchase Services in certain countries outside of the United States, we may require you, because of currency controls or other factors, to use the Currency Service. When using the Currency Service you are not tendering payment in one currency and receiving from us another currency.

**1.17.2** When you use the Currency Service, Service fees and charges will automatically be invoiced in the Payment Currency. You must pay invoices in the currency specified on each invoice, but, for credit card or debit card purchases, you may only make payments in currencies supported by the issuer of your card. If the issuer of your credit card or debit card does not support the required Payment Currency, you must use a different payment method that does support paying in the Payment Currency.

**1.17.3** Our fees and charges for your use of the Currency Service, if any, are included in the exchange rate applied to your invoice (the “Applicable Exchange Rate”). Third-parties, such as your bank, credit card issuer, debit card issuer, or card network, may charge you additional fees. The Applicable Exchange Rate is determined at the time your invoice is generated and, for invoices covering usage of Services over a period of time, will apply to all usage and Service charges listed on that invoice.

**1.17.4** All refunds processed against an invoice will be provided in the currency in which the invoice was generated and reflected as a credit memo or a payment in your Payment Currency.

**1.17.5** You agree that by using the Currency Service, information related to your payment, including your name and address, may be used by our banking partners to process your payments in jurisdictions other than the United States.

#### 2\. Betas and Previews

**2.1.** This Section describes the additional terms and conditions under which you may (a) access and use certain features, technologies, and services made available to you by AWS that are not yet generally available, including, but not limited to, any products, services, or features labeled “beta”, “preview”, “pre-release”, or “experimental”, and any related AWS Content (each, a “Beta Service”) or (b) access and use Services and any related AWS Content available in AWS regions that are not generally available, including, but not limited to, any AWS regions identified by AWS as “beta”, “preview”, “pre-release”, or “experimental” (each, a “Beta Region”).

**2.2.** You must comply with all terms related to any Beta Service or Beta Region as posted on the AWS Site or otherwise made available to you. AWS may add or modify terms, including lowering or raising any usage limits, related to access to or use of any Beta Services or Beta Regions at any time. Service Level Agreements do not apply to Beta Services or Beta Regions.

**2.3.** You may provide AWS with information relating to your access, use, testing, or evaluation of Beta Services or Beta Regions, including observations or information regarding the performance, features, and functionality of Beta Services or Beta Regions (“Test Observations”). AWS will own and may use and evaluate all Test Observations for its own purposes. You will not use any Test Observations except for your internal evaluation purposes of any Beta Service or Beta Region.

**2.4.** AWS may suspend or terminate your access to or use of any Beta Service or Beta Region at any time. Your access to and use of each Beta Service and Beta Region will automatically terminate upon the release of a generally available version of the applicable Beta Service or Beta Region or upon notice of termination by AWS. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, after suspension or termination of your access to or use of any Beta Service or Beta Region for any reason, (a) you will not have any further right to access or use the applicable Beta Service or Beta Region, and (b) Your Content used in the applicable Beta Service or Beta Region may be deleted or inaccessible.

**2.5.** Test Observations, Suggestions concerning a Beta Service or Beta Region, and any other information about or involving (including the existence of) any Beta Service or Beta Region are considered AWS Confidential Information.

**2.6.** WITHOUT LIMITING ANY DISCLAIMERS IN THE AGREEMENT OR THE SERVICE TERMS, BETA SERVICES AND BETA REGIONS ARE NOT READY FOR GENERAL COMMERCIAL RELEASE AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, DEFECTS, OR HARMFUL COMPONENTS. ACCORDINGLY, AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THE AGREEMENT OR THESE SERVICES TERMS, AWS IS PROVIDING BETA SERVICES AND BETA REGIONS TO YOU “AS IS.” AWS AND ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE REGARDING BETA SERVICES AND BETA REGIONS, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY THAT THE BETA SERVICES AND BETA REGIONS WILL BECOME GENERALLY AVAILABLE, BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR FREE, OR FREE OF HARMFUL COMPONENTS, OR THAT ANY CONTENT, INCLUDING YOUR CONTENT, WILL BE SECURE OR NOT OTHERWISE LOST OR DAMAGED. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW, AWS AND ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF ANY COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. AWS’S AND ITS AFFILIATES’ AND LICENSORS’ AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY BETA SERVICES AND BETA REGIONS WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU ACTUALLY PAY US UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR THE SERVICES THAT GAVE RISE TO THE CLAIM DURING THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.  

#### 3\. Amazon CloudFront

You must own or have all necessary rights to use any domain name or SSL certificate that you use in conjunction with Amazon CloudFront. You are solely responsible for the renewal, security, and proper configuration of any SSL certificates that you provide for use with Amazon CloudFront, including any disclosure of your SSL certificates to third parties.  

#### 4\. AWS Outposts

**4.1.** Outposts Equipment. AWS will make equipment available to you to support your use of the AWS Outposts Service (the “Outposts Equipment”). AWS or its affiliates maintain all rights in the Outposts Equipment and is not selling, renting, leasing, or transferring any ownership, intellectual or other rights in the Outposts Equipment to you. You will not, and will not purport to, assign, grant, or transfer the Outposts Equipment or any interest in the Outposts Equipment to any individual or entity, and any such purported assignment, grant or transfer is void.

**4.2.** Facility Assessment. You will ensure that, at all times, the facility at which the Outposts Equipment is located (the “Designated Facility”) meets the minimum requirements necessary to support the installation, maintenance, use, and removal of the Outposts Equipment as described [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/outposts/latest/userguide/outposts-requirements.html) and otherwise as described in the Outposts Documentation or provided to you during the ordering and installation process.

**4.3.** Delivery and Use. You will ensure that you have all necessary rights, certifications, and licenses for the delivery, installation, maintenance, use, and removal of the Outposts Equipment at the Designated Facility. You are responsible for any damage to the Outposts Equipment while it is at the Designated Facility, unless caused by AWS. AWS may terminate your use of Outposts and remove the Outposts Equipment if you breach these terms or the terms of the Agreement with respect to Outposts.

**4.4.** Access to Outposts Equipment. You will give personnel designated by AWS prompt and reasonable access to the Designated Facility as necessary to deliver, install, inspect, maintain, and remove the Outposts Equipment. You will not require AWS personnel to sign, accept, or otherwise agree to any documentation as a condition of accessing the Designated Facility, and you agree that the terms of any such documentation are void even if signed by AWS personnel. You will ensure that no one accesses, moves, or repairs the Outposts Equipment other than (i) personnel designated by AWS, (ii) as permitted in writing by AWS in connection with the maintenance of Outposts Equipment, or (iii) as necessary due to a situation involving imminent injury, damage to property, or an active fire alarm system. You will ensure that no one modifies, alters, reverse engineers, or tampers with the Outposts Equipment. You acknowledge that the Outposts Equipment may be equipped with tamper monitoring.

**4.5.** Enterprise Support. You will remain enrolled in AWS Support at the Enterprise level during the entire period of your use of Outposts.

**4.6.** Services/SLAs/Security. The Service Terms for any Services that run locally on Outposts also apply to your use of those Services on Outposts. There are inherent differences between Services running locally on Outposts from those Services running at AWS operated facilities because the Outposts Equipment is physically located at the Designated Facility where you are responsible for physical security and access controls, as well as all power, networking, and environmental conditions. Due to these differences:

a. The Service Level Agreements for any Services that run locally on Outposts do not apply to your use of those Services on Outposts.

b. Any AWS commitments in the Agreement that depend on AWS’s operation of such physical security and access controls, or power, networking, and environmental conditions, do not apply to Outposts or any Services running locally on Outposts.

c. The security and compliance standards, certifications, audits, reports and attestations held by AWS do not apply to Outposts or any Services running locally on Outposts. You can find more information about Outposts security compliance and features [here](http://www.aws.amazon.com/outposts). 

#### 5\. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud

**5.1.** In conjunction with the Services, you may be allowed to use certain software (including related documentation) developed and owned by Microsoft Corporation or its licensors (collectively, the “Microsoft Software”).

**5.1.1.** If you use the Microsoft Software, Microsoft and its licensors require that you agree to these additional terms and conditions:

*   The Microsoft Software is neither sold nor distributed to you, and you may use it solely in conjunction with the Services.
*   You may not transfer or use the Microsoft Software outside the Services.
*   You may not remove, modify, or obscure any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices that are contained in or on the Microsoft Software.
*   You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Microsoft Software, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law.
*   Microsoft disclaims, to the extent permitted by applicable law, all warranties by Microsoft and any liability by Microsoft or its suppliers for any damages, whether direct, indirect, or consequential, arising from the Services.
*   Microsoft is not responsible for providing any support in connection with the Services. Do not contact Microsoft for support.
*   You are not granted any right to use the Microsoft Software in any application controlling aircraft or other modes of human mass transportation, nuclear or chemical facilities, life support systems, implantable medical equipment, motor vehicles, weaponry systems, or any similar scenario (collectively, “High Risk Use”). Microsoft and its suppliers disclaim any express or implied warranty of fitness for High Risk Use. High Risk Use does not include utilization of the Microsoft Software for administrative purposes, to store configuration data, engineering and/or configuration tools, or other non-control applications, the failure of which would not result in death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage. These non-controlling applications may communicate with the applications that perform the control, but must not be directly or indirectly responsible for the control function.
*   Microsoft is an intended third-party beneficiary of this Section 5.1.1, with the right to enforce its provisions.

**5.1.2.** For any instance running Microsoft Software (each, a “Microsoft Instance”), you may not use nesting, container, or similar technologies to sell or resell multiple instances, portions of an instance, or containers running within the Microsoft Instance, unless (a) you are the ultimate end user of the Microsoft Instance, (b) you have supplemented the Microsoft Instance with your own applications, or (c) you have added primary and significant functionality to the Microsoft Instance.

**5.2.** In conjunction with the Services, you may be allowed to use certain software (including related support, maintenance, and documentation) developed, owned, or provided by third parties or their licensors. Use of third party software is subject to these additional terms and conditions:

*   By using NVIDIA Corporation’s GRID Software, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of the [NVIDIA GRID Cloud End User License Agreement](http://aws-nvidia-license-agreement.s3.amazonaws.com/NvidiaGridAWSUserLicenseAgreement.DOCX).
*   By using NVIDIA Corporation’s Tesla Driver, CUDA Toolkit, cuDNN, NVENC, NVCUVID, NVM:, nvidia-smi, and NCCL Library Software, toolkits, and drivers, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of the [NVIDIA Cloud End User License Agreement](https://s3.amazonaws.com/EULA/Nvidia-EULA.txt) and [NVIDIA Third Party Materials Notices](https://s3.amazonaws.com/EULA/Nvidia-3P-Notice.txt).
*   By using Red Hat, Inc.’s software, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of the [Red Hat Cloud Software Subscription Agreement](http://www.redhat.com/licenses/cloud_cssa/). Red Hat also disclaims any (i) warranties with respect to Red Hat, Inc. software; and (ii) liability for any damages, whether direct, indirect, incidental, special, punitive or consequential, and any loss of profits, revenue, data or data use, arising from use of Red Hat, Inc. software.
*   By using SUSE LLC’s software, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of the [SUSE End User License Agreement](https://www.suse.com/licensing/eula) and the [SUSE Terms and Conditions](https://www.suse.com/products/terms_and_conditions.pdf).
*   By using Apple Inc.’s software, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of the applicable [Apple Software License Agreement](https://www.apple.com/legal/sla/).  
    

**5.3.** Unless you specify a termination date, your Spot Instance request will remain active until the earlier of the following: (1) seven days have passed, (2) we fulfill it, or (3) you cancel it. We may terminate, stop, or hibernate Spot Instances at any time and without any notice to you if the current price for the applicable Spot Instance (the “Spot Price”) equals or exceeds the price you specified you were willing to pay for the Spot Instance (“Your Maximum Price”). Spot Instances purchased for a fixed duration (“Spot Blocks”) will not be terminated because the Spot Price equals or exceeds Your Maximum Price (if specified), but will terminate at the conclusion of the fixed duration. Spot Instances and Spot Blocks may also be terminated for AWS capacity requirements. If a Spot Block is terminated due to AWS capacity requirements, you will not be charged for that Spot Block. Spot Instances may not be used with certain Services, features, and third-party software we specify, including IBM software packages or Microsoft SQL Server. You may not, directly, indirectly, alone, or in cooperation with any third party, attempt to control, influence, or manipulate the price for Spot Instances. You may not submit requests for Spot Instances through any third party (e.g., “proxy bidding”) or share information with any third party regarding Your Maximum Price specified in your Spot Instance Requests.

**5.4.** EC2 Reserved Instances and Dedicated Hosts.

**5.4.1.** We may change Savings Plans, EC2 Reserved Instance and EC2 Dedicated Host Reservation pricing at any time, but price changes will not apply to previously designated Savings Plans, EC2 Reserved Instances or EC2 Dedicated Host Reservations, except as described in this Section 5.4. If Microsoft increases the license fees it charges for Windows, or if Red Hat increases the license fees it charges for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (“RHEL”), we may make a corresponding increase to the per-hour usage rate (or institute a corresponding per-hour usage rate) for Savings Plans for, or EC2 Reserved Instances with, Windows or RHEL. Any increase in (or institution of) the per-hour usage rate for Savings Plans for, or EC2 Reserved Instances with, Windows will be made between December 1 and January 31, and we will provide 30 days’ notice. For any increase in (or institution of) the per-hour usage rate for Savings Plans for, or EC2 Reserved Instances with, RHEL, we will provide 30 days’ advance notice. If this happens, you may: (a) continue to use your EC2 Reserved Instances with Windows or RHEL with the new per-hour usage price; (b) convert your EC2 Reserved Instances with Windows or RHEL to comparable EC2 Reserved Instances with Linux; or (c) terminate your EC2 Reserved Instances with Windows or RHEL and receive a pro rata refund of the up-front fee you paid for the terminated EC2 Reserved Instances with Windows or RHEL.

**5.4.2.** We may terminate the Savings Plans, EC2 Reserved Instance or EC2 Dedicated Host Reservation pricing programs at any time. Savings Plans and EC2 Dedicated Hosts are nontransferable, and EC2 Reserved Instances are only transferrable in accordance with the requirements of the RI Marketplace provided on the AWS Site. Scheduled Instances and Convertible Reserved Instances are not eligible for the RI Marketplace. Savings Plans, EC2 Reserved Instances and EC2 Dedicated Host Reservations are noncancellable, and EC2 Dedicated Hosts associated with an active EC2 Dedicated Host Reservation cannot be removed from your account, so you will be charged for the duration of the term you selected, even if you terminate the Agreement. All amounts paid in connection with Savings Plans, EC2 Reserved Instances and EC2 Dedicated Host Reservations are nonrefundable, except that if we terminate the Agreement other than for cause, terminate an individual EC2 Reserved Instance or EC2 Dedicated Host Reservation type, or terminate the Savings Plans, EC2 Reserved Instance or EC2 Dedicated Host pricing program(s), we will refund you a pro rata portion of any up-front fee paid in connection with any previously designated Savings Plans, EC2 Reserved Instances or EC2 Dedicated Hosts. You may not purchase EC2 Reserved Instances for the purpose of reselling them in the RI Marketplace, and we reserve the right to refuse or cancel your purchase if we suspect you are doing so. Upon expiration or termination of the term of Savings Plans, EC2 Reserved Instances or EC2 Dedicated Host Reservations, the reserved pricing will expire and standard on-demand usage prices will apply. You are responsible for determining if you are subject to any limitations arising from the purchase or Savings Plans, EC2 Reserved Instances or EC2 Dedicated Host Reservations. For example, you are responsible for complying with any applicable laws, policies, terms or conditions governing your payment of up-front fees or the expiration of reserved resources, including any fiscal or appropriation laws, or other policies or restrictions governing up-front payments for goods or services. 

**5.5.** EC2 Reserved Instance (RI) Marketplace.

**5.5.1.** The rights to an active EC2 Reserved Instance can be offered for sale through the RI Marketplace as long as (1) the remaining term on the Reserved Instance is greater than 1 month and (2) your payment of the upfront charge for it has been received and processed (for credit card purchases, 30 days after you have paid the upfront fee, and for invoice purchases, after you have paid the applicable invoice) (a “Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance”). You can be a “Seller” if you are a current AWS customer in good standing, you have a Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance associated with your AWS account, and you complete the registration process through your AWS account. You can be a “Buyer” if you are a current AWS customer in good standing. Non-U.S.-based entities may not be Sellers without providing the Form W-8BEN (Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding) to establish that you are not a U.S. person. You can resell an EC2 Reserved Instance that you previously purchased through the RI Marketplace. You may not resell an EC2 Reserved Instance that you purchased through a discount program (Reserved Instance Volume Discounts or otherwise) without obtaining our prior approval.

**5.5.2.** As a Seller, you will be the seller of record of your rights to a Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance. Except as expressly set forth in these Service Terms, we are not involved in any underlying transaction between you and any Buyer. We or our affiliates may also participate in the RI Marketplace as a Seller or a Buyer. We may remove any Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance from the RI Marketplace at any time. Once sold and transferred to a Buyer, a Seller will have no rights to that Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance.

**5.5.3.** On Seller’s behalf, we will process all payments for Transactions and collect the applicable Transaction Proceeds. “Transaction” means any sale of a Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance through the RI Marketplace. “Transaction Proceeds” means the gross sales proceeds received by us from any Transaction. You will ensure that all fees and charges payable by Buyers for Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance are billed and collected through us and you will not offer or establish any alternative means of payment. We may impose transaction limits on some or all Buyers and Sellers relating to the value of any Transaction or disbursement, the cumulative value of all Transactions or disbursements during a period of time, or the number of Transactions that we will process over a period of time. We may withhold for investigation, or refuse to process, any Transaction that we suspect is fraudulent, unlawful, or otherwise violates these Service Terms, the Agreement, or the Acceptable Use Policy. For each Transaction, we will not remit Transaction Proceeds to a Seller, and the Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance will not be available to the Buyer, until after we have successfully processed payments for that Transaction from the Buyer.

**5.5.4.** You will not receive any funds collected from payments associated with the hourly prices of your Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance. At the end of each business day, we will pay to you all due and payable Transaction Proceeds that we have collected as of the date that is 2 business days prior to that date. We will deduct from each payment any applicable fees and charges due to us related to Marketable EC2 Reserved Instances. We may withhold, deduct, or setoff any amounts payable by you to us or our affiliates against any Transaction Proceeds. Payments will be made only to an ACH-enabled bank account located in the United States that you register with us. If there is an error in the processing of any Transaction, you authorize us to initiate debit or credit entries to your designated bank account, to correct such error, provided that any such correction is made in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. If we are unable to debit your designated bank account for any reason, you authorize us to resubmit the debit, plus any applicable fees, to any other bank account or payment instrument that you have on file with us or to deduct the debit and applicable fees from future Transaction Proceeds.

**5.5.5.** Sellers are responsible for the calculation, validation, and payment of any and all sales, use, excise, import, export, value added, withholding, and other taxes and duties assessed, incurred, or required to be collected or paid (“Taxes”) for any reason in connection with any Transaction and with any Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance. We are not responsible for determining whether any Taxes apply to any Transaction or remitting Taxes to any taxing authority with respect to any Transaction, or for reporting any information (including the payment of Taxes) with respect to any Transaction. Each Seller will indemnify us and our affiliates against any claim or demand for payment of any Taxes imposed in connection with any Transaction, and for any fines, penalties, or similar charges imposed as a result of the Seller’s failure to collect, remit, or report any Taxes in connection with any Transaction.

**5.5.6.** For each Seller, we will collect the necessary data and tax forms to enable compliance with applicable tax laws. For example, for U.S.-based Sellers, we will collect and retain Seller name and address, and may collect the tax identification number and other data as needed to comply with Form 1099K reporting requirements; for non-U.S.-based Sellers, we will collect and retain a Form W-8BEN tax form (which includes name, address, and a signature) as proof that you are exempt from Form 1099K reporting. For each Buyer, we will collect and retain the Buyer’s name and address. Buyers and Sellers will not know the name of the other party to the Transaction until the Transaction is completed. Upon completion of the Transaction, we will share the applicable Buyer’s city, state, and zip with the Seller so that the Seller can calculate the appropriate tax (if any) to remit to the appropriate government entity. We will share the Seller’s legal name on the Buyer’s invoice. Buyers and Sellers may not use information about the Transaction or about the other party gained in connection with a Transaction (“Transaction Information”) for any purpose that is not related to the Transaction. For example, you may not, directly or indirectly: (1) disclose any Transaction Information to any third party, except as necessary for you to perform your tax obligations or other obligations under these Service Terms and only if you ensure that every recipient uses the information only for that purpose and complies with these restrictions; (2) use any Transaction Information for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever; (3) use any Transaction Information in any way inconsistent with applicable law; (4) contact a party to influence them to make an alternative sale or purchase; or (5) target communications of any kind on the basis of the intended recipient being an RI Marketplace Buyer or Seller.

**5.6.** Amazon EC2 enables you to provision Amazon EC2 instances using your Microsoft Software and Microsoft Licenses (the “BYOL Program”). Unless otherwise specified in your agreement(s) with Microsoft, you can participate in the BYOL Program only if you comply with the requirements [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/byol-windows-images.html), and you (a) use Dedicated Instances or Dedicated Hosts; and (b) launch from Virtual Machines (VMs) sourced from software binaries provided by you.

You must be eligible to use the BYOL Program for the applicable Microsoft Software under your agreements with Microsoft. You are solely responsible for obtaining all required licenses and for complying with all applicable Microsoft licensing requirements, including the Product Use Rights/Product Terms. By using the Microsoft Software under the BYOL Program, you agree to Microsoft's End User License Agreement.

You agree that you have determined that your use of the BYOL Program will comply with the applicable Microsoft licensing requirements. Usage of the Services in violation of your agreement(s) with Microsoft is not authorized or permitted.

**5.7.** As part of using Amazon EC2, you agree that your Amazon EC2 resources may be terminated or replaced due to failure, retirement or other AWS requirements. THE USE OF AMAZON EC2 DOES NOT GRANT YOU, AND YOU HEREBY WAIVE, ANY RIGHT OF PHYSICAL ACCESS TO, OR PHYSICAL POSSESSION OF, ANY AWS SERVERS, EQUIPMENT, REAL OR PERSONAL PROPERTY, OR OTHER ASSETS.  

#### 6\. Alexa Web Services

You may use data you receive from the Alexa Services Web Information Service and Alexa Top Sites (collectively “Alexa Web Services”), such as web site traffic data, to enhance your application or website, but may not use it in any application whose primary purpose is to display the same or related data or to compete with www.alexa.com. You may not display data you receive via the Alexa Web Services that has been cached for more than 24 hours. You may not resell or redistribute the Alexa Web Services or data you access via the Alexa Web Services.  

#### 7\. Amazon SimpleDB Service (Amazon SimpleDB)

If during the previous 6 months you have incurred no fees for Amazon SimpleDB and have registered no usage of Your Content stored in Amazon SimpleDB, we may delete Your Content that is stored in Simple DB upon 30 days prior notice to you.  

#### 8\. Amazon CloudWatch and Autoscaling

Amazon CloudWatch collects and stores certain information for the Services you are monitoring, including CPU utilization, data transfer, and disk usage and activity (collectively, “CloudWatch Metric Data”). CloudWatch Metric Data may be used by AWS to maintain and provide the Services (including development and improvement of the Services).  

#### 9\. AWS Import/Export Disk, AWS Snowball, AWS Snowcone and AWS Snowmobile

**9.1.** “AWS Import/Export” includes: AWS Import/Export Disk, AWS Snowball, AWS Snowcone and AWS Snowmobile.

#### 42\. Amazon Lumberyard Engine

**42.1.** Lumberyard Materials. Amazon Lumberyard consists of an engine, integrated development environment, related assets, and tools we make available [here](https://aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/downloads/) or otherwise designate as Lumberyard materials (collectively, “Lumberyard Materials”). The Lumberyard Materials include the “[Lumberyard Redistributables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/lumberyard-redistributables.html)”. Lumberyard Materials are AWS Content. The term “Lumberyard Materials” does not include Content distributed with the Lumberyard Materials under separate license terms (such as code licensed under an open source license).

**42.2.** License. In addition to the rights granted to AWS Content under the Agreement, we also grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable (except to End Users as provided below), non-transferrable license to do the following during the Term:

(a) Development: You may use, reproduce, modify, and create derivative works of the Lumberyard Materials to develop and support video games, software, audio-visual works, and other content (each work created through use of the Lumberyard Materials is a “Lumberyard Project”). Lumberyard Projects, excluding any AWS Content and Third Party Content included therein, are Your Content.

(b) Distribution to End Users: You may use, reproduce, modify, create derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute (including via third party distributors) to End Users the Lumberyard Redistributables (including any permitted modifications and derivatives) as part of a Lumberyard Project. However, you may do so only if (i) the Lumberyard Project provides material content or functionality beyond that provided by the Lumberyard Redistributables themselves, (ii) the Lumberyard Redistributables are integrated into the Lumberyard Project so they are not separately usable by End Users, (iii) you do not distribute in source code form Lumberyard Redistributables that we make available in file formats that are commonly compiled (e.g., C, C++) or for which we make a compiler available, and (iv) you ensure End Users are subject to terms no less protective of the Lumberyard Materials than these Service Terms, including this Section and Sections 42.4 and 42.5 below. You may sublicense these rights, subject to the restrictions in these terms, to your End Users to allow them to use, modify, create new content for, and redistribute your Lumberyard Project (e.g., create new items or levels for a game).

(c) Collaboration with other AWS customers. You may reproduce and distribute (but not sublicense) the Lumberyard Materials (including any permitted modifications and derivatives): (i) to other AWS customers that are contractors of yours solely for the purpose of allowing those AWS customers to perform work on your behalf, (ii) to other AWS customers in connection with work you perform for them as a contractor, and (iii) to up to 5 other AWS customers who you authorize to distribute a Lumberyard Project in connection with your sale or licensing of that Lumberyard Project (e.g., publishers of a game you develop). Those other AWS customers’ rights to the Lumberyard Materials are governed by their agreement(s) with us.

(d) Lumberyard Git Repository. We may make available certain Lumberyard Materials on the “[Lumberyard Git Repository](https://github.com/aws/lumberyard)”. You may reproduce and distribute to other AWS customers, via the Lumberyard Git Repository, your modified version(s) of those Lumberyard Materials (your “LM Fork(s)”), subject to any policies we may establish for the Lumberyard Git Repository. Your LM Fork must comply with the Agreement (including these terms); for example, it may not enable Lumberyard Projects to use, or read or write data to or from, Alternate Web Services. You must include a notice stating that the LM Fork is subject to these terms (such as a copy of the License.txt file from the root directory of the Lumberyard Materials). If you obtain an LM Fork from the Lumberyard Git Repository, you are responsible for ensuring that any Lumberyard Project you create with it complies with these terms. If your LM Fork violates the Agreement, then it infringes our copyright in the Lumberyard Materials and we may remove it from the Lumberyard Git Repository and take other actions, including terminating your license to the Lumberyard Materials. “Alternate Web Service” means any non-AWS web service that is similar to or can act as a replacement for the services listed [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/lumberyard-alternate-web-services.html).

**42.3.** No License Fee. There is no fee for the licenses granted in Section 42.2. Other AWS Services, AWS Content and Third Party Content made available in connection with the Lumberyard Materials may be subject to separate charges and governed by additional terms.

**42.4.** Operating Restrictions. Without our prior written consent, (a) the Lumberyard Materials (including any permitted modifications and derivatives) may only be run on computer equipment owned and operated by you or your End Users, or on AWS Services, and may not be run on any Alternate Web Service and (b) your Lumberyard Project may not read data from or write data to any Alternate Web Service.

**42.5.** Other Restrictions. Without limiting the license restrictions set out in the Agreement, you may not (a) distribute the Lumberyard Materials in source code form, except as expressly permitted by Section 42.2(b) and (c), (b) use or exploit the Lumberyard Materials or any portion thereof to develop, maintain, participate in the development of, or support any competing engine, development tool, or software framework, (c) use the Lumberyard Materials or any portion thereof as part of a logo or trademark, (d) remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trademark notices) contained in the Lumberyard Materials, (e) take any action that would require us or you to license, distribute, or otherwise make available to anyone the Lumberyard Materials under different terms (e.g., combining Lumberyard Materials with software subject to “copyleft” open source licenses), or (f) use or exploit the Lumberyard Materials or any portion thereof in any manner or for any purpose other than as expressly permitted by these terms.

**42.6.** Registration; Release. Before distributing your Lumberyard Project to End Users, you must register [here](https://aws.amazon.com/gametech/?audit=2019q1). You must obtain our prior written consent if the initial public or commercial release of your Lumberyard Project is based on a version of the Lumberyard Materials more than 5 years old.

**42.7.** Credit. You must credit us in Lumberyard Projects in accordance with [these guidelines](https://aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/logo-guidelines). AWS Marks included in the Lumberyard Materials may only be used in accordance with the Trademark Use Guidelines. We may use excerpts of publicly released promotional material from your Lumberyard Projects and related trademarks, service marks, trade names, and logos in connection with our marketing, advertisement, and promotion of Lumberyard.

In addition to your rights to distribute LM Forks on the Lumberyard Git Repository set out above, when discussing Lumberyard Materials in our forums or elsewhere, you may include up to 50 lines of source code from the Lumberyard Materials for the sole purpose of discussing that code. You must identify us as the source of the code. “Lumberyard Submissions” are content relating to Lumberyard Materials (including LM Forks) that you post or otherwise submit to developer discussion sites, sample code repositories, or other AWS or public forums. You grant (i) us a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferrable, sublicensable, royalty-free, and fully paid up license under all intellectual property rights to your Lumberyard Submissions, and (ii) other AWS customers the same rights to your Lumberyard Submissions as these Service Terms provide to the Lumberyard Materials. You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights to grant the license above, and that your Lumberyard Submissions do not infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party or violate this Agreement.

**42.9.** Data Collection. The Lumberyard Materials may provide us with information about the use of the Lumberyard Materials, including information about system and server resources, features used in the integrated development environment, frequency and duration of use, geographic and network locations, and error and information messages.

**42.10.** Acceptable Use; Safety-Critical Systems. Your use of the Lumberyard Materials must comply with the AWS Acceptable Use Policy. The Lumberyard Materials are not intended for use with life-critical or safety-critical systems, such as use in operation of medical equipment, automated transportation systems, autonomous vehicles, aircraft or air traffic control, nuclear facilities, manned spacecraft, or military use in connection with live combat. However, this restriction will not apply in the event of the occurrence (certified by the United States Centers for Disease Control or successor body) of a widespread viral infection transmitted via bites or contact with bodily fluids that causes human corpses to reanimate and seek to consume living human flesh, blood, brain or nerve tissue and is likely to result in the fall of organized civilization.

**42.11.** Termination. Your rights in the Lumberyard Materials automatically terminate if the Agreement terminates or you breach the Agreement (including these Service Terms). However, if we terminate the Agreement for convenience, your rights in Lumberyard Materials then in your possession survive termination with respect to any previously registered Lumberyard Project. Otherwise, upon termination, you must cease all use, distribution, and other exploitation of the Lumberyard Materials (and any modifications and derivatives).

**50.6.** AI Services are not intended for use in, or in association with, the operation of any hazardous environments or critical systems that may lead to serious bodily injury or death or cause environmental or property damage. The foregoing does not apply to the use of Amazon HealthLake in connection with providing or supporting healthcare services.

**50.8**. Law Enforcement Use of Amazon Rekognition. Amazon Rekognition’s face comparison feature uses machine learning to detect similarities between faces in different images and generate predictions of the likelihood the same person appears in both images; it does not provide definitive identifications of any person. Given the nature of machine learning systems, the following terms apply when Law Enforcement Agencies use Amazon Rekognition’s face comparison feature in connection with criminal investigations. “Law Enforcement Agency” means a government entity whose primary purpose and responsibilities are criminal investigation, apprehension and prosecution.

**50.8.1**. If Amazon Rekognition is used to assist in identifying a person, and actions will be taken based on the identification that could impact that person’s civil liberties or equivalent human rights, the decision to take action must be made by an appropriately trained person based on their independent examination of the identification evidence.

**50.8.2**. Law Enforcement Agencies that use Amazon Rekognition to assist personnel in making decisions that could impact civil liberties or equivalent human rights must ensure such personnel receive appropriate training on responsible use of facial recognition systems, including how to properly operate the system and interpret its results. For an example of how to implement such training, see the [Facial Recognition Policy Development Template](https://bja.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh186/files/Publications/Face-Recognition-Policy-Development-Template-508-compliant.pdf) published by the U.S Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Assistance.

**50.8.3**. Amazon Rekognition may not be used for sustained surveillance of a specific person without following an independent review process that is designed to protect civil liberties or equivalent human rights (such as obtaining a court order, warrant, or other authorization), unless the use is to address exigent circumstances involving a threat of death or serious harm to a person.

**50.8.4**. Law Enforcement Agencies that use Amazon Rekognition for criminal investigations must provide a public disclosure describing their use of facial recognition systems. The method and content of the disclosure is at the reasonable discretion of the agency, but should be easily accessible to the public (such as a posting on a website), describe how the facial recognition system is used, and summarize safeguards in place to prevent violations of civil liberties or equivalent human rights. For examples, see [statements](https://www.fbi.gov/news/testimony/facial-recognition-technology-ensuring-transparency-in-government-use) and [privacy assessments](https://www.fbi.gov/services/information-management/foipa/privacy-impact-assessments/facial-analysis-comparison-and-evaluation-face-services-unit) from the FBI and the [Facial Recognition Policy Development Template](https://bja.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh186/files/Publications/Face-Recognition-Policy-Development-Template-508-compliant.pdf) published by the U.S Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Assistance.

**50.9.** Amazon has implemented a moratorium on use of Amazon Rekognition’s face comparison feature by police departments in connection with criminal investigations. This moratorium does not apply to use of Amazon Rekognition’s face comparison feature to help identify or locate missing persons. For more information, see our announcement on our [Amazon Day One Blog](https://blog.aboutamazon.com/policy/we-are-implementing-a-one-year-moratorium-on-police-use-of-rekognition).

**53.3.** If, as a part of Amazon Chime, AMCS provides you or your End Users with any telephone number (whether toll or toll-free), you understand and agree that you do not own the number and you do not have the right to keep that number indefinitely. AMCS reserves the right to change, cancel, or move telephone numbers.

**53.4.** You and your End Users have the option to use Amazon Chime to record the applicable audio or video session along with chat and other types of recordings (collectively, “Recording”). If you or your End Users request that an audio or video session or other communication be recorded, Amazon Chime will attempt to notify you and your End Users of the Recording by providing a brief audio or visual notice at the time you and your End Users sign in to participate in the applicable session or communication.

AWS is not a party to the agreement between you and any Providers for their Provider Services, is not responsible or liable for Provider Services, and does not guarantee the quality or accuracy of Provider Services. For avoidance of doubt, any certification that a Provider obtains from us only certifies that the Provider has passed a test intended to evaluate the Provider’s proficiency and understanding of a particular AWS Service or area of knowledge to which that certification relates, and is not a guarantee that the Provider Services will be performed at any particular level of quality, speed, or to your specific requirements.

**70.2.** AWS charges service fees for transactions between you and Providers on the AWS IQ marketplace. AWS only collects these service fees if you and a Provider pay and receive payment through the AWS IQ marketplace. Therefore, for 24 months from the time you identify a Provider through AWS IQ, you agree to use AWS IQ as your exclusive method to pay for Provider Services. For avoidance of doubt, if you did not identify a Provider through use of AWS IQ, such as if you worked with a Provider prior to connecting with that Provider on AWS IQ, then this section does not apply.

**70.3.** You acknowledge and agree that we may use information from AWS IQ listings, proposals, chat communications, and additional terms proposed or agreed to between you and Providers on AWS IQ to develop and improve the quality and feature set of AWS IQ. 

**70.4.** If you choose to grant Providers access to your AWS account, you are solely responsible and liable for (a) any actions taken by the Provider in your account; (b) the Provider’s use of Your Content or use of the Services or AWS Content; (c) ensuring the Provider complies with your obligations under the Agreement, the Acceptable Use Policy, any other Policies, and applicable laws; (d) ensuring the Provider does not use the Services or AWS Content in any manner or for any purpose other than as expressly permitted by the Agreement; and (e) ensuring Provider does not attempt to (i) modify, distribute, alter, tamper with, repair, or otherwise create derivative works of any AWS Content or other Content included in the Services (except to the extent Content included in the Services is provided to you under a separate license that expressly permits the creation of derivative works), (ii) reverse engineer, disassemble, or decompile the Services or AWS Content or apply any other process or procedure to derive the source code of any software included in the Services or AWS Content (except to the extent applicable law doesn’t allow this restriction), (iii) access or use the Services in a way intended to avoid incurring fees or exceeding usage limits or quotas, or (iv) resell or sublicense the Services or AWS Content. You will immediately revoke Provider’s access to your AWS account if you become aware of any violation of your obligations under the Agreement caused by a Provider with access to your AWS account. If you use AWS IQ’s feature that allows you to grant a Provider access to your account, AWS may, but is not obligated to, review activities in your account for security purposes, and may revoke the Provider’s access at any time.

**70.5.** You release us (and our agents and employees) from claims, demands, and damages (actual or consequential) of any and every kind and nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with your use of the AWS IQ marketplace.
