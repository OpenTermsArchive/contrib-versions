AWS Service Terms
=================

Last Updated: August 8, 2025
----------------------------

1\. Universal Service Terms (Applicable to All Services)
--------------------------------------------------------

The Service Terms below govern your use of the Services. Capitalized terms used in these Service Terms but not defined below are defined in the [AWS Customer Agreement](https://aws.amazon.com/agreement/) or other agreement with us governing your use of the Services (the “Agreement”). For purposes of these Service Terms, “Your Content” includes any “Company Content” and any “Customer Content,” and “AWS Content” includes “Amazon Properties.”

**1.1.** You may not transfer outside the Services any software (including related documentation) you obtain from us or third party licensors in connection with the Services without specific authorization to do so.

**1.2.** You must comply with current technical documentation applicable to the Services (including applicable user, admin, and developer guides) posted on the AWS Site at [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/index.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/index.html) (and any successor or related locations designated by us). 

**1.3.** You will provide information or other materials related to Your Content (including copies of any client-side applications) as reasonably requested by us to verify your compliance with the Agreement. You will reasonably cooperate with us to identify the source of any problem with the Services that we reasonably believe may be attributable to Your Content or any end user materials that you control.

**1.4.** In connection with your use of the Services, you are responsible for maintaining licenses and adhering to the license terms of any software you run. If we reasonably believe any of Your Content violates the law, infringes or misappropriates the rights of any third party, or otherwise violates a material term of the Agreement (including the Service Terms, or the Acceptable Use Policy) (“Prohibited Content”), we will notify you of the Prohibited Content and may request that such content be removed from the Services or access to it be disabled. If you do not remove or disable access to the Prohibited Content within 2 business days of our notice, we may remove or disable access to the Prohibited Content or suspend the Services to the extent we are not able to remove or disable access to the Prohibited Content. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may remove or disable access to any Prohibited Content without prior notice in connection with illegal content, where the content may disrupt or threaten the Services or in accordance with applicable law or any judicial, regulatory or other governmental order or request. In the event that we remove Your Content without prior notice, we will provide prompt notice to you unless prohibited by law. We terminate the accounts of repeat infringers in appropriate circumstances.

**1.5.** You will ensure that all information you provide to us via the AWS Site (e.g., information provided in connection with your registration for the Services, requests for increased usage limits) is accurate, complete, and not misleading.

**1.6.** From time to time, we may apply upgrades, patches, bug fixes, or other maintenance to the Services and AWS Content (“Maintenance”). We agree to use reasonable efforts to provide you with prior notice of any scheduled Maintenance (except for emergency Maintenance), and you agree to use reasonable efforts to comply with any Maintenance requirements that we notify you about.

**1.7.** If your Agreement does not include a provision on AWS Confidential Information, and you and AWS do not have an effective non-disclosure agreement in place, then you agree that you will not disclose AWS Confidential Information (as defined in the AWS Customer Agreement), except as required by law.

**1.8.** You may perform benchmarks or comparative tests or evaluations (each, a “Benchmark”) of the Services. If you perform or disclose, or direct or permit any third party to perform or disclose, any Benchmark of any of the Services, you (i) will include in any disclosure, and will disclose to us, all information necessary to replicate such Benchmark, and (ii) agree that we may perform and disclose the results of Benchmarks of your products or services, irrespective of any restrictions on Benchmarks in the terms governing your products or services.

**1.9.** Only the applicable AWS Contracting Party (as defined in the AWS Customer Agreement) will have obligations with respect to each AWS account, and no other AWS Contracting Party has any obligation with respect to such account. The AWS Contracting Party for an account may change as described in the Agreement, and the new AWS Contracting Party will be responsible for issuing any invoices to you after such change, including monthly invoices. Invoices for each account will reflect the AWS Contracting Party that is responsible for that account during the applicable billing period. You agree to accept invoices from AWS electronically, in a format and method of delivery as determined by AWS, e.g., in a PDF format, as permitted under applicable law.

If, as of the time of a change of the AWS Contracting Party responsible for your account, you have made an up-front payment for any Services under such account, then the AWS Contracting Party you paid such up-front payment to may remain the AWS Contracting Party for the applicable account only with respect to the Services related to such up-front payment.

**1.10.** When you use a Service, you may be able to use or be required to use one or more other Services (each, an “Associated Service”), and when you use an Associated Service, you are subject to the terms and fees that apply to that Associated Service.

**1.11.** If you process the personal data of End Users or other identifiable individuals in your use of a Service, you are responsible for providing legally adequate privacy notices and obtaining necessary consents for the processing of such data. You represent to us that you have provided all necessary privacy notices and obtained all necessary consents. You are responsible for processing such data in accordance with applicable law.

**1.12.** If you have been charged for a Service for a period when that Service was unavailable (as defined in the applicable Service Level Agreement for each Service), you may request a Service credit equal to any charged amounts for such period.

**1.13.** If you are a customer that is subject to the French Politique générale de sécurité des systems d’information de santé (PGSSI-S), you agree that your use of the Services complies with the PGSSI-S.

**1.14. Data Protection.**

**1.14.1** These Service Terms incorporate the [AWS Data Processing Addendum](https://d1.awsstatic.com/legal/aws-dpa/aws-dpa.pdf) (“DPA”), when you use AWS Services to process Customer Data (as defined in the DPA).   

**1.14.2** These Service Terms incorporate the [AWS Supplementary Addendum](https://d1.awsstatic.com/legal/aws-dpa/supplementary-addendum-to-the-aws-dpa.pdf) to the DPA, when you use AWS Services to process Customer Data (as defined in the DPA).  

**1.14.3** These Service Terms incorporate the Standard Contractual Clauses between controllers and processors (“[Controller-to-Processor Clauses](https://d1.awsstatic.com/legal/aws-dpa/controller-to-processor-sccs.pdf)”) and the Standard Contractual Clauses between processors (“[Processor-to-Processor Clauses](https://d1.awsstatic.com/legal/aws-dpa/processor-to-processor-sccs.pdf)”) approved by the European Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/914 of 4 June 2021 (the “SCCs”). The SCCs will only apply when: (i) the GDPR applies to your use of the AWS Services to process Customer Data; and (ii) Customer Data is transferred either directly or via onward transfer, to a country outside of the European Economic Area not recognised by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data subject to GDPR (together a “Data Transfer”). When you are a controller (as defined in the GDPR), the Controller-to-Processor Clauses will apply to a Data Transfer. When you are a processor (as defined in the GDPR), the Processor-to-Processor Clauses will apply to a Data Transfer.

**1.14.4** These Service Terms incorporate the [AWS UK GDPR Addendum](https://d1.awsstatic.com/legal/aws-dpa/aws-uk-gdpr-dpa.pdf) to the DPA, when the UK GDPR applies to your use of the AWS Services to process UK Customer Data (as defined in the AWS UK GDPR Addendum), and the [AWS Swiss Addendum](https://d1.awsstatic.com/legal/aws-dpa/swiss-addendum-to-AWS-DPA.pdf) to the DPA, when the FDPA applies to your use of the AWS Services to process Swiss Customer Data (as defined in the AWS Swiss Addendum).  

**1.14.5** These Service Terms incorporate the [AWS CCPA Terms](https://d1.awsstatic.com/legal/aws-ccpa/aws-ccpa-terms.pdf) (“CCPA Terms”), when the CCPA applies to your use of the AWS Services to process Personal Information (as defined in the CCPA Terms).

**1.15.** Following closure of your AWS account, we will delete Your Content in accordance with the technical documentation applicable to the Services.

**1.16.** Your receipt and use of any Promotional Credits is subject to the [AWS Promotional Credit Terms & Conditions](https://aws.amazon.com/awscredits/).

**1.17. Payment Currency**

**1.17.1** AWS provides a Service that enables payment in certain currencies (“Payment Currency”) other than United States dollars when you purchase certain Services from AWS (the “Currency Service”). When you purchase Services in certain countries outside of the United States, we may require you, because of currency controls or other factors, to use the Currency Service. When using the Currency Service you are not tendering payment in one currency and receiving from us another currency.

**1.17.2** When you use the Currency Service, Service fees and charges will automatically be invoiced in the Payment Currency. You must pay invoices in the currency specified on each invoice, but, for credit card or debit card purchases, you may only make payments in currencies supported by the issuer of your card. If the issuer of your credit card or debit card does not support the required Payment Currency, you must use a different payment method that does support paying in the Payment Currency.

**1.17.3** Our fees and charges for your use of the Currency Service, if any, are included in the exchange rate applied to your invoice (the “Applicable Exchange Rate”). Third-parties, such as your bank, credit card issuer, debit card issuer, or card network, may charge you additional fees. The Applicable Exchange Rate is determined at the time your invoice is generated and, for invoices covering usage of Services over a period of time, will apply to all usage and Service charges listed on that invoice.

**1.17.4** All refunds processed against an invoice will be provided in the currency in which the invoice was generated and reflected as a credit memo or a payment in your Payment Currency.

**1.17.5** You agree that by using the Currency Service, information related to your payment, including your name and address, may be used by our banking partners to process your payments in jurisdictions other than the United States.

**1.18.** By accessing and using AWS Content or the Services, you agree to the terms of the [Intellectual Property License](https://aws.amazon.com/legal/aws-ip-license-terms/).

**1.19.** We will not use Individualized Usage Data or Your Content to compete with your products and services. “Individualized Usage Data” means data about your use of the Services that are specifically identified with your AWS account.  

**1.20.** We may use information about how you use and interact with the Services to improve those Services.  

**1.21**. Information included in resource identifiers, metadata tags, access controls, rules, usage policies, permissions, and similar items related to the management of AWS resources does not constitute Your Content. AWS recommends that you do not include personally identifying, confidential, or sensitive information in these items.  

**1.22. Tax Exempt Status** 

**1.22.1** To request tax exempt status for your AWS account, you must provide us with a valid tax exemption certificate or other equivalent documentation for the relevant jurisdiction.  You are responsible for updating such documentation so it is accurate at all times.  

**1.22.2** In certain jurisdictions (as noted in the [AWS Tax Help](https://aws.amazon.com/tax-help/) pages), you may only use your tax-exempt account to purchase services that are eligible for tax exemption. If you do not use services for the purpose for which your tax exemption applies, you are responsible for reporting and paying sales and use taxes for that usage directly to the relevant tax authorities to the extent required by law. 

**1.22.3** If you are required by law to pay us using your organization’s funds to qualify for your tax exemption, you warrant that purchases on your account will be made with the tax-exempt organization’s funds. 

**1.22.4** We may, in our sole discretion, reject your request for tax exempt status or revoke the tax exempt status of your account at any time.

**1.22.5** If you turn on [tax settings inheritance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/manage-account-payment.html#manage-account-tax-linked-accounts), you warrant that the application of any tax exemption on your Management Account to your Organization’s Member Accounts (both as defined in the AWS Organizations section below) complies with applicable tax laws. If a governmental authority determines that the correct amount of tax has not been collected on your purchases, you will assist AWS as necessary (including providing information and documentation as reasonably required) to substantiate your payment of those taxes and promptly reimburse AWS for any associated costs.

**1.23.** If you use any artificial intelligence and machine learning Services, features, and functionality (including third-party models) that we provide, it’s your responsibility to ensure that your use complies with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and the [AWS Responsible AI Policy](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/responsible-ai/policy).

**1.24.** Certain Services may incorporate generative AI features, powered by Amazon Bedrock, that enable you to use prompts to generate output, including: Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon CodeCatalyst, Amazon Connect Contact Lens, AWS Database Migration Service, Amazon DataZone, Amazon Lex, Amazon Personalize, Amazon Q, AWS Transform, AWS AppFabric, AWS HealthScribe, AWS App Studio, and Kiro (Preview).  

**1.24.1.** The Amazon Bedrock automated abuse detection mechanisms may apply to such services. See [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/abuse-detection.html) for more details.

**1.24.2.** To improve performance, such services may use cross-region inference, using the optimal AWS Region to process your Content when running model inference. See the applicable service documentation for more details.

**1.25.** You will not use, and will not facilitate or allow End Users to use, the Services to mine cryptocurrency without our prior written approval.

**1.26.** AWS consents to the assignment of an AWS account from one entity to another, subject to the terms of the AWS Account Assignment Requirements, posted [here](https://aws.amazon.com/legal/aws-account-assignment-requirements/).

**1.27**. To benefit from any contract with AWS enabling you to use AWS Services under the same terms as your affiliate's Agreement solely because your accounts are joined as Member Accounts of their Organization (as defined in the AWS Organizations section below), your AWS Contracting Party must be a signatory to your affiliate's Agreement.

2\. Betas and Previews
----------------------

**2.1.** This Section describes the additional terms and conditions under which you may (a) access and use certain features, technologies, and services made available to you by AWS that are not yet generally available, including, but not limited to, any products, services, or features labeled “beta”, “preview”, “pre-release”, or “experimental”, and any related AWS Content (each, a “Beta Service”) or (b) access and use Services and any related AWS Content available in AWS regions that are not generally available, including, but not limited to, any AWS regions identified by AWS as “beta”, “preview”, “pre-release”, or “experimental” (each, a “Beta Region”).

**2.2.** You must comply with all terms related to any Beta Service or Beta Region as posted on the AWS Site or otherwise made available to you. AWS may add or modify terms, including lowering or raising any usage limits, related to access to or use of any Beta Services or Beta Regions at any time. AWS may add, modify, or remove functionality, features, documentation, or other related aspects of any Beta Service or Beta Region at any time and these aspects may be different from any generally available version of the applicable Beta Service or Beta Region. Service Level Agreements do not apply to Beta Services or Beta Regions.

**2.3.** You may provide AWS with information relating to your access, use, testing, or evaluation of Beta Services or Beta Regions, including observations or information regarding the performance, features, and functionality of Beta Services or Beta Regions (“Test Observations”). AWS will own and may use and evaluate all Test Observations for its own purposes. You will not use any Test Observations except for your internal evaluation purposes of any Beta Service or Beta Region.

**2.4.** AWS may suspend or terminate your access to or use of any Beta Service or Beta Region at any time. Your access to and use of each Beta Service and Beta Region will automatically terminate upon the release of a generally available version of the applicable Beta Service or Beta Region or upon notice of termination by AWS. Unless otherwise communicated to You, any Beta Service or Beta Region made available to You is provided for evaluation purposes and should not be used for processing sensitive data. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, after suspension or termination of your access to or use of any Beta Service or Beta Region for any reason, (a) you will not have any further right to access or use the applicable Beta Service or Beta Region, and (b) Your Content used in the applicable Beta Service or Beta Region may be deleted or inaccessible and Your Content may not be migrated over to a generally available version of the applicable Beta Service or Beta Region.

**2.5.** Test Observations, Suggestions concerning a Beta Service or Beta Region, and any other information about or involving (including the existence of) any Beta Service or Beta Region are considered AWS Confidential Information.

**2.6.** WITHOUT LIMITING ANY DISCLAIMERS IN THE AGREEMENT OR THE SERVICE TERMS, BETA SERVICES AND BETA REGIONS ARE NOT READY FOR GENERAL COMMERCIAL RELEASE AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, DEFECTS, OR HARMFUL COMPONENTS. ACCORDINGLY, AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THE AGREEMENT OR THESE SERVICES TERMS, AWS IS PROVIDING BETA SERVICES AND BETA REGIONS TO YOU “AS IS.” AWS AND ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE REGARDING BETA SERVICES AND BETA REGIONS, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY THAT THE BETA SERVICES AND BETA REGIONS WILL BECOME GENERALLY AVAILABLE, BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR FREE, OR FREE OF HARMFUL COMPONENTS, OR THAT ANY CONTENT, INCLUDING YOUR CONTENT, WILL BE SECURE OR NOT OTHERWISE LOST OR DAMAGED. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW, AWS AND ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF ANY COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. AWS’S AND ITS AFFILIATES’ AND LICENSORS’ AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY BETA SERVICES AND BETA REGIONS WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU ACTUALLY PAY US UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR THE BETA SERVICES OR BETA REGIONS THAT GAVE RISE TO THE CLAIM DURING THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.  

3\. Amazon CloudFront
---------------------

You must own or have all necessary rights to use any domain name or SSL certificate that you use in conjunction with Amazon CloudFront. You are solely responsible for the renewal, security, and proper configuration of any SSL certificates that you provide for use with Amazon CloudFront, including any disclosure of your SSL certificates to third parties.  

4\. AWS Outposts
----------------

**4.1.** “AWS Outposts” includes AWS Outposts racks and AWS Outposts servers.

**4.2.** Outposts Equipment. AWS will make equipment available to you to support your use of the AWS Outposts Service (the “Outposts Equipment”). AWS or its affiliates maintain all rights in the Outposts Equipment and is not selling, renting, leasing, or transferring any ownership, intellectual or other rights in the Outposts Equipment to you. You will not, and will not purport to, assign, grant, or transfer the Outposts Equipment or any interest in the Outposts Equipment to any individual or entity, and any such purported assignment, grant or transfer is void.  

**4.3.** Facility Assessment. You will ensure that, at all times, the facility at which the Outposts Equipment is located (the “Designated Facility”) meets the minimum requirements necessary to support the installation, maintenance, use, and removal of the Outposts Equipment as described [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/outposts/latest/userguide/outposts-requirements.html) and otherwise as described in the Outposts technical documentation or indicated to you during the ordering and installation process.

**4.4.** Delivery and Use. You will ensure that you have all necessary rights, certifications, and licenses for the delivery, installation, maintenance, use, and removal of the Outposts Equipment at the Designated Facility. You are responsible for any damage to the Outposts Equipment while it is at the Designated Facility, unless caused by AWS. AWS may terminate your use of AWS Outposts and remove the Outposts Equipment if you breach these terms or materially breach the terms of the Agreement with respect to AWS Outposts. In the event that we terminate your use of AWS Outposts and remove the Outposts Equipment in accordance with this Section 4.4, we will provide you with prior notice where practicable under the circumstances.  

**4.5.** Access to Outposts Equipment. You will give personnel designated by AWS prompt and reasonable access to the Designated Facility as necessary to deliver, install, inspect, maintain, and remove the Outposts Equipment. You will not require AWS personnel to sign, accept, or otherwise agree to any documentation as a condition of accessing the Designated Facility, and you agree that the terms of any such documentation are void even if signed by AWS personnel. You will ensure that no one accesses, moves, or repairs the Outposts Equipment other than (i) personnel designated by AWS, (ii) as permitted in writing by AWS in connection with the maintenance of Outposts Equipment, or (iii) as necessary due to a situation involving imminent injury, damage to property, or an active fire alarm system. You will ensure that no one modifies, alters, reverse engineers, or tampers with the Outposts Equipment. You acknowledge that the Outposts Equipment may be equipped with tamper monitoring.

**4.6.** AWS Support Options. You will remain enrolled in either [Enterprise On-Ramp Support](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/plans/enterprise-onramp/) or [Enterprise Support](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/plans/enterprise/) during the entire period of your use of AWS Outposts.

**4.7.** Services/SLAs/Security. The Service Terms for any Services that run locally on AWS Outposts also apply to your use of those Services on AWS Outposts. There are inherent differences between Services running locally on AWS Outposts from those Services running at AWS operated facilities because the Outposts Equipment is physically located at the Designated Facility where you are responsible for physical security and access controls, as well as all power, networking, and environmental conditions. Due to these differences:

a. The Service Level Agreements for any Services that run locally on AWS Outposts do not apply to your use of those Services on AWS Outposts.

b. Any AWS commitments in the Agreement that depend on AWS’s operation of such physical security and access controls, or power, networking, and environmental conditions, do not apply to AWS Outposts or any Services running locally on AWS Outposts.

c. The specific compliance and assurance programs for which AWS Outposts are in scope are listed [here](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/). For other Services listed [here](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/), those Services are not in scope when running locally on AWS Outposts unless AWS Outposts is also separately listed for the specific compliance or assurance program.

**4.8.** AWS Outposts servers  

**4.8.1.** Installation, Use, and Removal. You are responsible for the installation, use, and removal of the AWS Outposts servers at the Designated Facility and returning the Outposts Equipment to AWS as described in the Outposts technical documentation or as otherwise indicated to you during the ordering process. In addition to other rights and remedies AWS may have under the Agreement, AWS may charge you a lost device fee if the Outposts Equipment is lost between when it is first in your possession and when the carrier accepts the Outposts Equipment for delivery back to AWS. You must notify and obtain AWS’s consent before moving the Outpost Equipment from the Designated Facility.  

5\. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
--------------------------------

**5.1.** In conjunction with the Services, you may be allowed to use certain software (including related documentation) developed and owned by Microsoft Corporation or its licensors (collectively, the “Microsoft Software”).

**5.1.1.** If you use the Microsoft Software, Microsoft and its licensors require that you agree to these additional terms and conditions:

* The Microsoft Software is neither sold nor distributed to you, and you may use it solely in conjunction with the Services.
* You may not transfer or use the Microsoft Software outside the Services.
* You may not remove, modify, or obscure any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices that are contained in or on the Microsoft Software.
* You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Microsoft Software, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law.
* Microsoft disclaims, to the extent permitted by applicable law, all warranties by Microsoft and any liability by Microsoft or its suppliers for any damages, whether direct, indirect, or consequential, arising from the Services.
* Microsoft is not responsible for providing any support in connection with the Services. Do not contact Microsoft for support.
* You are not granted any right to use the Microsoft Software in any application controlling aircraft or other modes of human mass transportation, nuclear or chemical facilities, life support systems, implantable medical equipment, motor vehicles, weaponry systems, or any similar scenario (collectively, “High Risk Use”). Microsoft and its suppliers disclaim any express or implied warranty of fitness for High Risk Use. High Risk Use does not include utilization of the Microsoft Software for administrative purposes, to store configuration data, engineering and/or configuration tools, or other non-control applications, the failure of which would not result in death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage. These non-controlling applications may communicate with the applications that perform the control, but must not be directly or indirectly responsible for the control function.
* Microsoft is an intended third-party beneficiary of this Section 5.1.1, with the right to enforce its provisions.

**5.1.2.** For any instance running Microsoft Software (each, a “Microsoft Instance”), you may not use nesting, container, or similar technologies to sell or resell multiple instances, portions of an instance, or containers running within the Microsoft Instance, unless (a) you are the ultimate end user of the Microsoft Instance, (b) you have supplemented the Microsoft Instance with your own applications, or (c) you have added primary and significant functionality to the Microsoft Instance.

**5.2.** In conjunction with the Services, you may be allowed to use certain software (including related support, maintenance, and documentation) developed, owned, or provided by third parties or their licensors. Use of third party software is subject to these additional terms and conditions:

* Your use of NVIDIA Corporation’s GRID Software is subject to the terms and conditions of the [NVIDIA GRID Cloud End User License Agreement](https://aws-nvidia-license-agreement.s3.amazonaws.com/NvidiaGridAWSUserLicenseAgreement.DOCX).
* Your use of NVIDIA Corporation’s Tesla Driver, CUDA Toolkit, cuDNN, NVENC, NVCUVID, NVM:, nvidia-smi, and NCCL Library Software, toolkits, and drivers is subject to the terms and conditions of the [NVIDIA Cloud End User License Agreement](https://s3.amazonaws.com/EULA/NVidiaEULAforAWS.pdf) and [NVIDIA Third Party Materials Notices](https://s3.amazonaws.com/EULA/Nvidia-3P-Notice.txt).
* Your use of Red Hat, Inc.’s software is subject to the terms and conditions of the [Red Hat Cloud Software Subscription Agreement](http://www.redhat.com/licenses/cloud_cssa/). Red Hat also disclaims any (i) warranties with respect to Red Hat, Inc. software; and (ii) liability for any damages, whether direct, indirect, incidental, special, punitive or consequential, and any loss of profits, revenue, data or data use, arising from use of Red Hat, Inc. software.
* Your use of SUSE LLC’s software is subject to the terms and conditions of the [SUSE End User License Agreement](https://www.suse.com/licensing/eula) and the [SUSE Terms and Conditions](https://www.suse.com/products/terms_and_conditions.pdf).
* Your use of Apple Inc.’s software is subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable [Apple Software License Agreement](https://www.apple.com/legal/sla/).
* Your use of Qualcomm Technologies Inc.’s software is subject to the terms and conditions of Qualcomm’s [Software Development Kit License Agreement](https://d1.awsstatic.com/legal/awsserviceterms/qualcomm-cloud-software-development-kit-license-agreement.pdf).

**5.3.** Unless you specify a termination date, your Spot Instance request will remain active until the earlier of the following: (1) seven days have passed, (2) we fulfill it, or (3) you cancel it. We may terminate, stop, or hibernate Spot Instances at any time and without any notice to you if the current price for the applicable Spot Instance (the “Spot Price”) equals or exceeds the price you specified you were willing to pay for the Spot Instance (“Your Maximum Price”). Spot Instances purchased for a fixed duration (“Spot Blocks”) will not be terminated because the Spot Price equals or exceeds Your Maximum Price (if specified), but will terminate at the conclusion of the fixed duration. Spot Instances and Spot Blocks may also be terminated for AWS capacity requirements. If a Spot Block is terminated due to AWS capacity requirements, you will not be charged for that Spot Block. Spot Instances may not be used with certain Services, features, and third-party software we specify, including IBM software packages or Microsoft SQL Server. You may not, directly, indirectly, alone, or in cooperation with any third party, attempt to control, influence, or manipulate the price for Spot Instances. You may not submit requests for Spot Instances through any third party (e.g., “proxy bidding”) or share information with any third party regarding Your Maximum Price specified in your Spot Instance Requests.

**5.4.** EC2 Reserved Instances and Dedicated Hosts.

**5.4.1.** We may change Savings Plans, EC2 Reserved Instance and EC2 Dedicated Host Reservation pricing at any time, but price changes will not apply to previously designated Savings Plans, EC2 Reserved Instances or EC2 Dedicated Host Reservations, except as described in this Section 5.4. If Microsoft increases the license fees it charges for Windows, or if Red Hat increases the license fees it charges for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (“RHEL”), we may make a corresponding increase to the per-hour usage rate (or institute a corresponding per-hour usage rate) for Savings Plans for, or EC2 Reserved Instances with, Windows or RHEL. Any increase in (or institution of) the per-hour usage rate for Savings Plans for, or EC2 Reserved Instances with, Windows will be made between December 1 and January 31, and we will provide 30 days’ notice. For any increase in (or institution of) the per-hour usage rate for Savings Plans for, or EC2 Reserved Instances with, RHEL, we will provide 30 days’ advance notice. If this happens, you may: (a) continue to use your EC2 Reserved Instances with Windows or RHEL with the new per-hour usage price; (b) convert your EC2 Reserved Instances with Windows or RHEL to comparable EC2 Reserved Instances with Linux; or (c) terminate your EC2 Reserved Instances with Windows or RHEL and receive a pro rata refund of the up-front fee you paid for the terminated EC2 Reserved Instances with Windows or RHEL.

**5.4.2.** We may terminate the Savings Plans, EC2 Reserved Instance or EC2 Dedicated Host Reservation pricing programs at any time. Savings Plans and EC2 Dedicated Hosts are nontransferable, and EC2 Reserved Instances are only transferrable in accordance with the requirements of the RI Marketplace provided on the AWS Site. Scheduled Instances and Convertible Reserved Instances are not eligible for the RI Marketplace. Savings Plans, EC2 Reserved Instances and EC2 Dedicated Host Reservations are noncancellable, and EC2 Dedicated Hosts associated with an active EC2 Dedicated Host Reservation cannot be removed from your account, so you will be charged for the duration of the term you selected, even if you terminate the Agreement. All amounts paid in connection with Savings Plans, EC2 Reserved Instances and EC2 Dedicated Host Reservations are nonrefundable, except that if we terminate the Agreement other than for cause, terminate an individual EC2 Reserved Instance or EC2 Dedicated Host Reservation type, or terminate the Savings Plans, EC2 Reserved Instance or EC2 Dedicated Host pricing program(s), we will refund you a pro rata portion of any up-front fee paid in connection with any previously designated Savings Plans, EC2 Reserved Instances or EC2 Dedicated Hosts. You may not purchase EC2 Reserved Instances for the purpose of reselling them in the RI Marketplace, and we reserve the right to refuse or cancel your purchase if we suspect you are doing so. Upon expiration or termination of the term of Savings Plans, EC2 Reserved Instances or EC2 Dedicated Host Reservations, the reserved pricing will expire and standard on-demand usage prices will apply. You are responsible for determining if you are subject to any limitations arising from the purchase of Savings Plans, EC2 Reserved Instances or EC2 Dedicated Host Reservations. For example, you are responsible for complying with any applicable laws, policies, terms or conditions governing your payment of up-front fees or the expiration of reserved resources, including any fiscal or appropriation laws, or other policies or restrictions governing up-front payments for goods or services. 

**5.5.** EC2 Capacity Blocks for ML. AWS Capacity Blocks cannot be canceled nor can they be modified, and the full price of a Capacity Block is nonrefundable. You are responsible for determining if you are subject to any limitations arising from the purchase of Capacity Blocks. For example, you are responsible for complying with any applicable laws, policies, terms or conditions governing your payment of up-front fees or the expiration of reserved resources, including any fiscal or appropriation laws, or other policies or restrictions governing up-front payments for goods or services. During the final 30 minutes of a Capacity Block, we may terminate your instances without notice and prevent new instance launches into your reservation. Capacity Blocks are nontransferable. Capacity Blocks that you purchase cannot be resold to another party, and we reserve the right to refuse or cancel your purchase if we suspect you are doing so. You may not cooperate with any third party in an attempt to influence or manipulate the price for Capacity Blocks.

**5.6.** EC2 Reserved Instance (RI) Marketplace.

**5.6.1.** The rights to an active EC2 Reserved Instance can be offered for sale through the RI Marketplace as long as (1) the remaining term on the Reserved Instance is greater than 1 month and (2) your payment of the upfront charge for it has been received and processed (for credit card purchases, 30 days after you have paid the upfront fee, and for invoice purchases, after you have paid the applicable invoice) (a “Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance”). You can be a “Seller” if you are a current AWS customer in good standing, you have a Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance associated with your AWS account, and you complete the registration process through your AWS account. You can be a “Buyer” if you are a current AWS customer in good standing. Non-U.S.-based entities may not be Sellers without providing the Form W-8BEN (Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding) to establish that you are not a U.S. person. You can resell an EC2 Reserved Instance that you previously purchased through the RI Marketplace. You may not resell an EC2 Reserved Instance that you purchased through a discount program (Reserved Instance Volume Discounts or otherwise) without obtaining our prior approval.

**5.6.2.** As a Seller, you will be the seller of record of your rights to a Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance. Except as expressly set forth in these Service Terms, we are not involved in any underlying transaction between you and any Buyer. We or our affiliates may also participate in the RI Marketplace as a Seller or a Buyer. We may remove any Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance from the RI Marketplace at any time. Once sold and transferred to a Buyer, a Seller will have no rights to that Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance.

**5.6.3.** On Seller’s behalf, we will process all payments for Transactions and collect the applicable Transaction Proceeds. “Transaction” means any sale of a Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance through the RI Marketplace. “Transaction Proceeds” means the gross sales proceeds received by us from any Transaction. You will ensure that all fees and charges payable by Buyers for Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance are billed and collected through us and you will not offer or establish any alternative means of payment. We may impose transaction limits on some or all Buyers and Sellers relating to the value of any Transaction or disbursement, the cumulative value of all Transactions or disbursements during a period of time, or the number of Transactions that we will process over a period of time. We may withhold for investigation, or refuse to process, any Transaction that we suspect is fraudulent, unlawful, or otherwise violates these Service Terms, the Agreement, or the Acceptable Use Policy. For each Transaction, we will not remit Transaction Proceeds to a Seller, and the Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance will not be available to the Buyer, until after we have successfully processed payments for that Transaction from the Buyer.

**5.6.4.** You will not receive any funds collected from payments associated with the hourly prices of your Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance. At the end of each business day, we will pay to you all due and payable Transaction Proceeds that we have collected as of the date that is 2 business days prior to that date. We will deduct from each payment any applicable fees and charges due to us related to Marketable EC2 Reserved Instances. We may withhold, deduct, or setoff any amounts payable by you to us or our affiliates against any Transaction Proceeds. Payments will be made only to an ACH-enabled bank account located in the United States that you register with us. If there is an error in the processing of any Transaction, you authorize us to initiate debit or credit entries to your designated bank account, to correct such error, provided that any such correction is made in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. If we are unable to debit your designated bank account for any reason, you authorize us to resubmit the debit, plus any applicable fees, to any other bank account or payment instrument that you have on file with us or to deduct the debit and applicable fees from future Transaction Proceeds.

**5.6.5.** Sellers are responsible for the calculation, validation, and payment of any and all sales, use, excise, import, export, value added, withholding, and other taxes and duties assessed, incurred, or required to be collected or paid (“Taxes”) for any reason in connection with any Transaction and with any Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance. We are not responsible for determining whether any Taxes apply to any Transaction or remitting Taxes to any taxing authority with respect to any Transaction, or for reporting any information (including the payment of Taxes) with respect to any Transaction. Each Seller will indemnify us and our affiliates against any claim or demand for payment of any Taxes imposed in connection with any Transaction, and for any fines, penalties, or similar charges imposed as a result of the Seller’s failure to collect, remit, or report any Taxes in connection with any Transaction.

**5.6.6.** For each Seller, we will collect the necessary data and tax forms to enable compliance with applicable tax laws. For example, for U.S.-based Sellers, we will collect and retain Seller name and address, and may collect the tax identification number and other data as needed to comply with Form 1099K reporting requirements; for non-U.S.-based Sellers, we will collect and retain a Form W-8BEN tax form (which includes name, address, and a signature) as proof that you are exempt from Form 1099K reporting. For each Buyer, we will collect and retain the Buyer’s name and address. Buyers and Sellers will not know the name of the other party to the Transaction until the Transaction is completed. Upon completion of the Transaction, we will share the applicable Buyer’s city, state, and zip with the Seller so that the Seller can calculate the appropriate tax (if any) to remit to the appropriate government entity. We will share the Seller’s legal name on the Buyer’s invoice. Buyers and Sellers may not use information about the Transaction or about the other party gained in connection with a Transaction (“Transaction Information”) for any purpose that is not related to the Transaction. For example, you may not, directly or indirectly: (1) disclose any Transaction Information to any third party, except as necessary for you to perform your tax obligations or other obligations under these Service Terms and only if you ensure that every recipient uses the information only for that purpose and complies with these restrictions; (2) use any Transaction Information for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever; (3) use any Transaction Information in any way inconsistent with applicable law; (4) contact a party to influence them to make an alternative sale or purchase; or (5) target communications of any kind on the basis of the intended recipient being an RI Marketplace Buyer or Seller.

If you opt to prepay, you agree to pay the amount listed in your Order and applicable taxes (“Prepaid Funds”) within 30 days of (a) the effective date of your Order, or (b) receipt of the prepayment invoice, whichever is later. If you do not prepay within 30-days, you will pay as described in the Agreement. Prepaid Funds are non-refundable and expire at the end of the term in the applicable Order.

**67.2.2.** Fees. AWS will charge you a fee equal to the value of any funding, discounts, or credits you receive for enterprise AWS Training if you do not consume AWS Training equal to the total amount listed in your Order, within the term specified in your Order.

**67.3.** Classroom Training

**67.3.2.** Enterprise Classroom Training. Either you or AWS may request to reschedule or cancel an enterprise Classroom Training class at least 14 days before the class start date.

If you make a timely rescheduling request but AWS is unable to reschedule, you may keep the original class start date, or AWS will cancel the class at no charge. If AWS makes a timely rescheduling request but you are unable to reschedule, AWS will cancel the class at no charge. The maximum number of individuals you may enroll in an enterprise Classroom Training class is 25.

As of the date the vouchers are emailed to the contact address listed in the Order, you are solely responsible for any voucher that is lost, stolen, or used without your permission.

If your subscription ends, you will no longer have access to the Digital Trainings you selected from the AWS Site. The service fees for Digital Training subscriptions are stated on the AWS Site. From time to time, we may offer different subscription lengths, and the subscription service fees may vary. Subscription service fees may be subject to tax and are non-refundable except as expressly set forth in this section.

For an Order of 5 or more subscriptions (“Seats”) to Digital Training on the AWS Site (a “Team Subscription”), you must provide AWS all reasonably necessary setup information within 5 business days of your Order’s effective date, or as otherwise specified in your Order. The Team Subscription provides you access to your Seats on the date AWS gives your learning administrator(s) access for the period listed in your Order. If you inform your AWS training representative in writing within 2 business days of the start date that you do not have access to your Seats, your Team Subscription will not start until AWS confirms you have access. Seats may only be used by a single person for the entire term of the Team Subscription, except that you may reassign up to twenty percent of Seats within your organization during the term of the Team Subscription.

**67.4.3.1.** Additional Seats. You may purchase additional Seats under your existing Team Subscription by contacting your AWS Training representative as described on the AWS Training detail page on the AWS Site. Your start date for additional Seats begins when AWS gives your learning administrator(s) access, and any additional Seats purchased will expire at the end of your existing Team Subscription. Fees for additional Seats are calculated pro-rata based on the time remaining in your existing Team Subscription.

**67.4.4.** Auto-Renewal. Unless you notify us before a charge that you want to cancel or do not want to auto renew, your Digital Training subscription will automatically continue and you authorize us (without notice to you, unless required by applicable law) to collect the then-applicable subscription service fees and any taxes, using any payment method we have on record for you. We may change the Digital Training subscription service fee from time to time by notifying you of the change and effective date before it takes effect. You may reject the change by cancelling your subscription at no additional cost at any time before a subscription service fee change takes effect. From time to time we may also offer non-recurring subscriptions. The provisions in this section regarding automatic renewal are not applicable to those subscriptions.  
If all payment methods we have on file for you are declined for payment of your subscription service fees, your subscription will be cancelled unless you provide us with a new payment method. If you provide us with a new payment method that is successfully charged before your subscription is cancelled, your new subscription period will be based on the original renewal date and not the date of the successful charge.

**67.5.** Enterprise Skills Transformation

**67.5.1.** Access. To enable EST support and guidance, AWS may require access to your internal communication systems including but not limited to email, instant messaging, and other systems related to such access as identified by you (“Customer Systems”).

Subject to your prior approval, you will arrange for AWS to have reasonable access to your Customer Systems to the extent required to enable EST, and at no additional cost to AWS. You may revoke your access approval at any time. AWS is not responsible for any failure to perform caused by your revocation of AWS’ access to your Customer Systems.

70\. AWS IQ
-----------

**70.1.** AWS IQ Experts (“Providers”) offer their services (“Provider Services”) as independent contractors, and are not employees of you or us. AWS is not a party to the agreement between you and any Providers for their Provider Services, is not responsible or liable for Provider Services, and does not guarantee the quality or accuracy of Provider Services. For avoidance of doubt, any certification that a Provider obtains from us only certifies that the Provider has passed a test intended to evaluate the Provider’s proficiency and understanding of a particular AWS Service or area of knowledge to which that certification relates, and is not a guarantee that the Provider Services will be performed at any particular level of quality, speed, or to your specific requirements.  

**70.2.** AWS charges service fees for transactions between you and Providers on the AWS IQ marketplace. AWS only collects these service fees if you and a Provider pay and receive payment through the AWS IQ marketplace. Therefore, for 24 months from the time you identify a Provider through AWS IQ, you agree to use AWS IQ as your exclusive method to pay for Provider Services. For avoidance of doubt, if you did not identify a Provider through use of AWS IQ, such as if you worked with a Provider prior to connecting with that Provider on AWS IQ, then this section does not apply.  

**70.3.** You acknowledge and agree that we may use information from AWS IQ listings, proposals, chat communications, and additional terms proposed or agreed to between you and Providers on AWS IQ to develop and improve the quality and feature set of AWS IQ.   

**70.4.** If you choose to grant Providers access to your AWS account, you are solely responsible and liable for (a) any actions taken by the Provider in your account; (b) the Provider’s use of Your Content or use of the Services or AWS Content; (c) ensuring the Provider complies with your obligations under the Agreement, the Acceptable Use Policy, any other Policies, the [Intellectual Property License](https://aws.amazon.com/legal/aws-ip-license-terms/) and applicable laws; (d) ensuring the Provider does not use the Services or AWS Content in any manner or for any purpose other than as expressly permitted by the Agreement and the [Intellectual Property License](https://aws.amazon.com/legal/aws-ip-license-terms/); and (e) ensuring Provider does not attempt to (i) modify, distribute, alter, tamper with, repair, or otherwise create derivative works of any AWS Content or other Content included in the Services (except to the extent Content included in the Services is provided to you under a separate license that expressly permits the creation of derivative works), (ii) reverse engineer, disassemble, or decompile the Services or AWS Content or apply any other process or procedure to derive the source code of any software included in the Services or AWS Content (except to the extent applicable law doesn’t allow this restriction), (iii) access or use the Services in a way intended to avoid incurring fees or exceeding usage limits or quotas, or (iv) resell or sublicense the Services or AWS Content. You will immediately revoke Provider’s access to your AWS account if you become aware of any violation of your obligations under the Agreement or the [Intellectual Property License](https://aws.amazon.com/legal/aws-ip-license-terms/) caused by a Provider with access to your AWS account. If you use AWS IQ’s feature that allows you to grant a Provider access to your account, AWS may, but is not obligated to, review activities in your account for security purposes, and may revoke the Provider’s access at any time.  

**70.5.** You release us (and our agents and employees) from claims, demands, and damages (actual or consequential) of any and every kind and nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with your use of the AWS IQ marketplace.

Palm Data include, but are not limited to, unique images, templates, and/or mathematical representations of End Users’ palms that are created using proprietary software and algorithms.

You understand and agree that Palm Data, and all related information, technology, processing and outputs required to generate, analyze, process, store, and use Palm Data, are not Your Content (as defined by the Agreement). You understand that all forms of Palm Data: (i) have economic value for AWS; (ii) are not readily known or knowable to others and; (iii) are subject to AWS’s reasonable efforts to keep them secret and confidential, and are, therefore, a trade secret of AWS and owned by AWS. You understand and agree that you and your End Users will not have any access to Palm Data, and you agree to notify your End Users of this before they use any Amazon One Enterprise Device.

To the extent AWS receives any Privacy Rights Requests, AWS will forward such Privacy Rights Requests to you and reasonably cooperate in providing you the necessary information for you to comply with Privacy Rights Requests. Further, you understand and agree that to the extent any Privacy Rights Requests relate to Palm Data, after you have verified the identity of the requestor: (a) if the request is a deletion request, you will notify AWS of the request, and AWS will permanently destroy the Palm Data in accordance with applicable law; or (b) if the request is an access or portability request, you will inform the requestor with sufficient particularity that you have collected Palm Data, but you understand and agree that you will not be able to disclose or provide access to Palm Data because it is sensitive personal information and applicable privacy laws prohibit you from disclosing or providing access to such sensitive personal information in response to a Privacy Rights Request. Moreover, you understand and agree that you do not and will not have access to Palm Data because it constitutes both sensitive personal information and AWS’s trade secret.

**101.7.** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, you agree and instruct that we may analyze, process, use, and store Your Content, End User information to: (a) maintain and provide Amazon One Enterprise Services, and (b) develop and improve Amazon One and Amazon One Enterprise Services, including any underlying technologies and any training and testing machine learning models.
