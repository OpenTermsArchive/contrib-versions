See [examples of information we collect or receive](https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/#Information_You_Give_Us).

#### How We Use Personal Information

We use your personal information to operate, provide, and improve AWS Offerings. Our purposes for using personal information include:

*   **Provide AWS Offerings:** We use your personal information to provide and deliver AWS Offerings and process transactions related to AWS Offerings, including registrations, subscriptions, purchases, and payments.
*   **Measure, Support, and Improve AWS Offerings:** We use your personal information to measure use of, analyze performance of, fix errors in, provide support for, improve, and develop AWS Offerings.
*   **Recommendations and Personalization:** We use your personal information to recommend AWS Offerings that might be of interest to you, identify your preferences, and personalize your experience with AWS Offerings.

#### Cookies

To enable our systems to recognize your browser or device, and to provide, market, and improve AWS Offerings, and to advertise to you on third-party websites and services, we and approved third parties use cookies and other identifiers. For more information about cookies and how we use them, please read our [Cookie Notice](https://aws.amazon.com/legal/cookies/).  

#### How We Share Personal Information

Information about our customers is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of selling our customers’ personal information to others. We share personal information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc. and the affiliates that Amazon.com, Inc. controls that are either subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.

*   **Transactions Involving Third Parties:** We make available to you services, software, and content provided by third parties for use on or through AWS Offerings. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share information related to those transactions with that third party. For example, you can order services, software, and content from sellers using the AWS Marketplace and we provide those sellers information to facilitate your subscription, purchases, or support.
*   **Third-Party Service Providers:** We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include: delivering AWS hardware, sending communications, processing payments, assessing credit and compliance risks, analyzing data, providing marketing and sales assistance (including advertising and event management), conducting customer relationship management, and providing training. These third-party service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Further, they must process that information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable data protection law.
*   **Business Transfers:** As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or services. In such transactions, personal information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the individual consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that AWS or substantially all of its assets are acquired, your information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
*   **Protection of Us and Others:** We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce or apply our terms and other agreements, or protect the rights, property, or security of AWS, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud prevention and detection and credit risk reduction.
*   **At Your Option:** Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal information about you might be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.  
    

#### Location of Personal Information

Amazon Web Services, Inc. is located in the United States, and our affiliated companies are located throughout the world. Depending on the scope of your interactions with AWS Offerings, your personal information may be stored in or accessed from multiple countries, including the United States. Whenever we transfer personal information to other jurisdictions, we will ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable data protection laws.  

#### How We Secure Information

At AWS, security is our highest priority. We design our systems with your security and privacy in mind.

*   We maintain a wide variety of compliance programs that validate our security controls. Learn more about our [compliance programs at AWS Cloud Security](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs/).
*   We protect the security of your information during transmission to or from AWS websites, applications, products, or services by using encryption protocols and software.
*   We follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) when handling credit card data.
*   We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage, and disclosure of personal information. Our security procedures mean that we may request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you.  
    

### Advertising

To help you receive more useful and relevant ads on other sites and services and to measure their effectiveness, AWS shares limited personal information with our advertising partners. We don’t share your name or other information that directly identifies you when we do this.

If you want to adjust your personalized advertising preferences, refer to the “Access and Choice” section below.

You can also manage cookies through your browser settings. The "Help" feature on most browsers and devices will tell you how to remove cookies from your device, how to prevent your browser or device from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.
*   **Sellers and Amazon Partners:** Sellers and Amazon Partner Network members can add, update, or delete information in the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/account-management) and [APN Partner Central](https://partnercentral.awspartner.com/SiteLogin), respectively.

We keep your personal information to enable your continued use of AWS Offerings, for as long as it is required in order to fulfill the relevant purposes described in this Privacy Notice, as may be required by law (including for tax and accounting purposes), or as otherwise communicated to you.
