Customer will provide Provider with official documentation or tax receipts on such withholdings supporting such taxes and such payments as may be required by Provider for its tax records as soon as reasonably possible following payment to the applicable tax authority, and in any event no later than when required by applicable law.
    *   Payment. Customer shall pay all Fees on or prior to the due date. Customer shall make all payments hereunder in US dollars by the method specified by Provider.

In connection with this Agreement, Provider and its Affiliates (collectively, as the “Disclosing Party”) may disclose or make available Confidential Information to the Customer (as the “Receiving Party”). Subject to Section 9.2, “Confidential Information” means information in any form or medium (whether oral, written, electronic or other) that the Disclosing Party considers confidential or proprietary, including information consisting of or relating to the Disclosing Party’s technology, trade secrets, know-how, business operations, plans, strategies, customers, and pricing, and information with respect to which the Disclosing Party has contractual or other confidentiality obligations, in each case whether or not marked, designated or otherwise identified as “confidential”. Without limiting the foregoing: all Provider Materials are the Confidential Information of Provider and its Affiliates and the financial terms of the Services are the Confidential Information of Provider and its Affiliates.
    *   Exclusions. Confidential Information does not include information that: (a) was rightfully known to the Receiving Party without restriction on use or disclosure prior to such information's being disclosed or made available to the Receiving Party in connection with this Agreement; (b) was or becomes generally known by the public other than by the Receiving Party's or any of its Representatives' noncompliance with this Agreement; (c) was or is received by the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a third party that, to the Receiving Party's knowledge, was not or is not, at the time of such receipt, under any obligation to maintain its confidentiality; or (d) was or is independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to or use of any Confidential Information.
    *   Protection of Confidential Information. As a condition to being provided with any disclosure of or access to Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall:
        *   not access or use Confidential Information other than as necessary to exercise its rights or perform its obligations under and in accordance with this Agreement;
        *   except as may be permitted by and subject to its compliance with Section 9.4, not disclose or permit access to Confidential Information other than to its Representatives who: (i) need to know such Confidential Information for purposes of the Receiving Party's exercise of its rights or performance of its obligations under and in accordance with this Agreement; (ii) have been informed of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and the Receiving Party's obligations under this Section 9.3; and (iii) are bound by confidentiality and restricted use obligations at least as protective of the Confidential Information as the terms set forth in this Section 9.3;
        *   safeguard the Confidential Information from unauthorized use, access or disclosure using at least the degree of care it uses to protect its similarly sensitive information and in no event less than a reasonable degree of care; and
        *   ensure its Representatives' compliance with, and be responsible and liable for any of its Representatives' non-compliance with, the terms of this Section 9.
    *   Compelled Disclosures. If the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives is compelled by applicable Law to disclose any Confidential Information then, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Receiving Party shall: (a) promptly, and prior to such disclosure, notify the Disclosing Party in writing of such requirement so that the Disclosing Party can seek a protective order or other remedy or waive its rights under Section 9.3; and (b) provide reasonable assistance to the Disclosing Party, at the Disclosing Party's sole cost and expense, in opposing such disclosure or seeking a protective order or other limitations on disclosure. If the Disclosing Party waives compliance or, after providing the notice and assistance required under this Section 9.4, the Receiving Party remains required by Law to disclose any Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information that the Receiving Party is legally required to disclose and, on the Disclosing Party's request, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurances from the applicable court or other presiding authority that such Confidential Information will be afforded confidential treatment.
*   Term and Termination.
    *   Term. The term of this Agreement commences as of the Effective Date and, unless terminated earlier pursuant to any of the Agreement's express provisions, will continue in effect until Provider no longer provides any Service to Customer (the “Term”).
    *   Termination. In addition to any other express termination right set forth elsewhere in this Agreement:
        *   Provider may terminate this Agreement or the Coverage Period of any Services, effective on written notice to Customer, if Customer: (i) fails to pay any amount when due hereunder, and such failure continues more than thirty (30) days after Provider's delivery of written notice thereof; or (ii) breaches any of its obligations under Section 3 (Authorization and Customer Restrictions) or Section 9 (Confidentiality).
        *   Provider may terminate this Agreement or the Coverage Period of any Service, effective on written notice to Customer, if Customer breaches this Agreement, and such breach: (i) is incapable of cure; or (ii) being capable of cure, remains uncured thirty (30) days after Provider provides the breaching party with written notice of such breach;
        *   Provider may terminate this Agreement or the Coverage Period of any Service at any time and for any reason by giving at least thirty (30) days’ written notice to Customer or immediately if Provider ceases to provide the applicable Service; and

        *   all rights, licenses, consents and authorizations granted by Provider to Customer hereunder will immediately terminate;
        *   subject to Section 10.3(d) below, upon Customer’s written request, Provider shall as promptly as practicable cease all use of Customer Data and Customer's Confidential Information and permanently erase all Customer Data and Customer's Confidential Information from all systems Provider directly or indirectly controls; provided that, for clarity, Provider's obligations under this Section 10.3(b) do not apply to any Resultant Data;

        *   notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, with respect to information and materials then in its possession or control: (i) Provider and its Affiliates may retain Customer Data, in its then current state and solely to the extent and for so long as required by applicable Law; (ii) Provider and its Affiliates may also retain Customer Data in its backups, archives and disaster recovery systems until such Customer Data is deleted in the ordinary course; and (iii) all information and materials described in this Section 10.3(d) will remain subject to all confidentiality, security and other applicable requirements of this Agreement;
        *   Provider may disable all Customer and Authorized User access to the Services and Provider Materials;
        *   if Provider terminates this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10, all Fees that would have become payable had the Agreement remained in effect until expiration of the Term will become immediately due and payable, and Customer shall pay such Fees, together with all previously-accrued but not yet paid Fees, on receipt of Provider's invoice therefor.
    *   Surviving Terms. The provisions set forth in the following sections, and any other right or obligation of the parties in this Agreement that, by its nature, should survive termination or expiration of this Agreement, will survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: Section 3.3, Section 8, Section 9, Section 10.3, this Section 10.4, Section 11, Section 12, Section 13, Section 15 and Section 16.
*   Representations and Warranties.
    *   Customer Representations and Warranties. Customer represents and warrants to Provider that:
        *   If Customer is a legal entity, it is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing as a corporation or other entity under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or other organization;
        *   Customer has the full right, power and authority to enter into and perform Customer’s obligations and grant the rights, licenses, consents and authorizations Customer grants or is required to grant under this Agreement;
        *   the acceptance of this Agreement by Customer’s representative has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or organizational action of such party; and
        *   when executed and delivered by both parties, this Agreement will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of Customer, enforceable against Customer in accordance with its terms.
    *   Additional Customer Representations, Warranties and Covenants. Customer represents, warrants and covenants to Provider that Customer owns or otherwise has and will have the necessary rights and consents in and relating to the Customer Data so that, as received by Provider and Processed in accordance with this Agreement, they do not and will not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate any Intellectual Property Rights, or any privacy or other rights of any third party or violate any applicable Law. Customer agrees that its use of the Services is neither contingent upon the delivery of any future functionality or features nor dependent upon any oral or written public comments made by Provider with respect to future functionality or features.
    *   DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ALL SERVICES AND PROVIDER MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” AND PROVIDER AND ITS AFFILIATES HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHER, AND PROVIDER AND ITS AFFILIATES SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ALL WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE OR TRADE PRACTICE. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, PROVIDER AND ITS AFFILIATES MAKE NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND THAT THE SERVICES OR PROVIDER MATERIALS, OR ANY PRODUCTS OR RESULTS OF THE USE THEREOF, WILL MEET CUSTOMER'S OR ANY OTHER PERSON'S REQUIREMENTS, OPERATE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION, ACHIEVE ANY INTENDED RESULT, BE COMPATIBLE OR WORK WITH ANY SOFTWARE, SYSTEM OR OTHER SERVICES, OR BE SECURE, ACCURATE, COMPLETE, FREE OF HARMFUL CODE OR ERROR FREE. ALL THIRD PARTY MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF OR CONCERNING ANY THIRD PARTY MATERIALS IS STRICTLY BETWEEN CUSTOMER AND THE THIRD PARTY OWNER OR DISTRIBUTOR OF THE THIRD PARTY MATERIALS. UNLESS PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL PROVIDER BE LIABLE, WHETHER OR NOT DUE TO ITS OWN NEGLIGENCE, FOR ANY: ACT OR OMISSION OF A THIRD PARTY; MISTAKES, OMISSIONS, INTERRUPTIONS, ERRORS, FAILURES TO TRANSMIT, DELAYS, OR DEFECTS IN THE SERVICES; DAMAGE OR INJURY CAUSED BY THE USE OF SERVICES; CLAIMS AGAINST CUSTOMER BY THIRD PARTIES; DAMAGE OR INJURY CAUSED BY A SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF SERVICES; OR DAMAGE OR INJURY CAUSED BY FAILURE OR DELAY IN CONNECTING TO ANY EMERGENCY SERVICE.
*   Indemnification.
    *   Customer Indemnification. Customer shall release, indemnify, defend and hold harmless Provider and its Subcontractors and Affiliates, and each of its and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns (each, a “Provider Indemnitee”) from and against any and all Losses incurred by such Provider Indemnitee in connection with any claim, suit, action or proceeding (each, an “Action”) by a third party arise out of or relate to any:
        *   Customer Data, including any Processing of Customer Data by or on behalf of Provider and its Affiliates in accordance with this Agreement;
        *   any other materials or information (including any documents, data, specifications, software, content or technology) provided by or on behalf of Customer or any Authorized User, including Provider's and its Affiliates’ compliance with any specifications or directions provided by or on behalf of Customer or any Authorized User;
        *   allegation of facts that, if true, would constitute Customer's breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or obligations under this Agreement; or

    *   Indemnification Procedure. Provider shall promptly notify Customer in writing of any Action for which such party believes it is entitled to be indemnified pursuant to Section 12.1. Provider (the “Indemnitee”) shall cooperate with Customer (the “Indemnitor”) at the Indemnitor's sole cost and expense. The Indemnitor shall immediately take control of the defense and investigation of such Action and shall employ counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee to handle and defend the same, at the Indemnitor's sole cost and expense. The Indemnitee's failure to perform any obligations under this Section 12.2 will not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations under this Section 12 except to the extent that the Indemnitor can demonstrate that it has been materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. The Indemnitee may participate in and observe the proceedings at its own cost and expense with counsel of its own choosing.
*   Limitations of Liability.
    *   EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL PROVIDER OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ITS SUBJECT MATTER UNDER ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, INCLUDING BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY AND OTHERWISE, FOR ANY: (a) LOSS OF PRODUCTION, USE, BUSINESS, REVENUE OR PROFIT OR DIMINUTION IN VALUE; (b) IMPAIRMENT, INABILITY TO USE OR LOSS, INTERRUPTION OR DELAY OF THE SERVICES, (c) LOSS, DAMAGE, CORRUPTION OR RECOVERY OF DATA, OR BREACH OF DATA OR SYSTEM SECURITY, OR (d) CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, ENHANCED OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH PERSONS WERE ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES OR SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES WERE OTHERWISE FORESEEABLE, AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ANY AGREED OR OTHER REMEDY OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
    *   CAP ON MONETARY LIABILITY. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE COLLECTIVE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF PROVIDER AND ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS AND SUPPLIERS UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ITS SUBJECT MATTER, UNDER ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, INCLUDING BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY AND OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY PAID BY CUSTOMER FOR SERVICES HEREUNDER DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS PERIOD PRIOR TO THE DATE THAT THE CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OCCURS. THE FOREGOING LIMITATION APPLIES NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ANY AGREED OR OTHER REMEDY OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
    *   Exclusive Remedy. If the Services fail to conform to the Service Descriptions and Customer provides written notice of the non-conformance to Provider, then, as Customer’s exclusive remedy and Provider’s sole obligation: Provider will either repair or, at its option, replace the non-conforming Service or, if Provider is unable to correct the non-conformance within (45) forty-five days of receipt of such written notice from Customer, Customer may terminate the applicable Services.
*   Force Majeure.
    *   No Breach or Default. In no event will Provider or any of its Affiliates be liable or responsible to Customer, or be deemed to have defaulted under or breached this Agreement, for any failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any term of this Agreement, when and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by any circumstances beyond Provider's or its Affiliates’ reasonable control (a “Force Majeure Event”), including but not limited to, acts of God, flood, fire, earthquake or explosion, war, terrorism, invasion, riot or other civil unrest, embargoes or blockades, interruptions or failures of telecommunication links due to hostile network attacks, cyberattacks, malware attacks, denial of service attacks or other computer related attacks, or other network congestion, national or regional emergency, strikes, labor stoppages or slowdowns or other industrial disturbances, passage of Law or any action taken by a governmental or public authority, including imposing an embargo, export or import restriction, quota or other restriction or prohibition or any complete or partial government shutdown, or national or regional shortage of adequate power or telecommunications or transportation. Either party may terminate this Agreement if a Force Majeure Event continues substantially uninterrupted for a period of thirty (30) days or more.
*   Dispute Resolution.
    
    ###### PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.
    
    *   Summary. Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by contacting Provider. In the unlikely event that Provider is unable to resolve a complaint to Customer’s satisfaction, Customer and Provider agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.
    *   Arbitration Agreement.
        *   Provider and Customer agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between them. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:
            1.  claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between the parties, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;
            2.  claims that arose before this or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);
            3.  claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which Customer is not a member of a certified class; and
            4.  claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.
        *   References to “Provider” and “Customer” include their respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of the Services under this or prior agreements between the parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individualized action in small claims court. Customer agrees that, by entering into this Agreement, Customer and Provider are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.
        *   A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute. The Notice of Dispute to Provider should be addressed to: Ubiquiti Inc., Customer Arbitration Demand, 685 Third Ave, 27th Fl, New York, NY 10017 with a copy sent to [legal@ui.com](mailto:legal@ui.com). The Notice of Dispute must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). If Provider and Customer do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice of Dispute is received, Customer or Provider may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Provider or Customer shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which Customer or Provider is entitled.
        *   ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES, SHALL BE RESOLVED ONLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION, CONDUCTED BY THE JUDICIAL ARBITRATION AND MEDIATION SERVICE (JAMS) (OR THEIR SUCCESSOR). If JAMS is unavailable, the parties shall agree to another arbitration provider or the court shall appoint a substitute. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide. Unless Customer and Provider agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in New York, New York. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of Customer’s claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), Customer agrees to reimburse Provider for its reasonable costs and expenses related to the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to JAMS filings, administration, arbitrator and other related fees.
        *   The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. CUSTOMER AND PROVIDER AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both Customer and Provider agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from arbitration and may be brought in court.
*   Miscellaneous.
    *   Further Assurances. Upon a party's reasonable request, the other party shall, at the requesting party's sole cost and expense, execute and deliver all such documents and instruments, and take all such further actions, necessary to give full effect to this Agreement.
    *   Relationship of the Parties. The relationship between the parties is that of independent contractors. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as creating any agency, partnership, joint venture or other form of joint enterprise, employment or fiduciary relationship between the parties, and neither party shall have authority to contract for or bind the other party in any manner whatsoever.
    *   Public Announcements. Neither party shall issue or release any announcement, statement, press release or other publicity or marketing materials relating to this Agreement or otherwise use the other party's trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names or other indicia of source, affiliation or sponsorship, in each case, without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, provided, however, that Provider may, without Customer's consent, include Customer's name in its lists of Provider's current or former customers of Provider in promotional and marketing materials.
    *   Notices. Notices sent will be deemed effectively given: (a) when received, if delivered by hand, with signed confirmation of receipt; (b) when received, if sent by a nationally recognized overnight courier, signature required; (c) when sent, if by facsimile or e-mail, if sent during the addressee's normal business hours, and on the next business day, if sent after the addressee's normal business hours; and (d) on the second day after the date mailed by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid.
    *   Interpretation. For purposes of this Agreement: (a) the words “include,” “includes” and “including” are deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation”; (b) the word “or” is not exclusive; (c) the words “herein,” “hereof,” “hereby,” “hereto” and “hereunder” refer to this Agreement as a whole; (d) words denoting the singular have a comparable meaning when used in the plural, and vice-versa; and (e) words denoting any gender include all genders. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this Agreement: (x) to sections, exhibits, schedules, attachments and appendices mean the sections of, and exhibits, schedules, attachments and appendices attached to, this Agreement; (y) to an agreement, instrument or other document means such agreement, instrument or other document as amended, supplemented and modified from time to time to the extent permitted by the provisions thereof; and (z) to a statute means such statute as amended from time to time and includes any successor legislation thereto and any regulations promulgated thereunder. The parties intend this Agreement to be construed without regard to any presumption or rule requiring construction or interpretation against the party drafting an instrument or causing any instrument to be drafted. Any exhibits, schedules, attachments and appendices referred to herein are an integral part of this Agreement to the same extent as if they were set forth verbatim herein.
    *   Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for reference only and do not affect the interpretation of this Agreement.
    *   Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with any other documents incorporated herein by reference, constitutes the sole and entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to such subject matter.
    *   Assignment. Customer shall not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights, or delegate or otherwise transfer any of its obligations or performance, under this Agreement, in each case whether voluntarily, involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, without Provider's prior written consent. For purposes of the preceding sentence, and without limiting its generality, any merger, consolidation or reorganization involving Customer (regardless of whether Customer is a surviving or disappearing entity) will be deemed to be a transfer of rights, obligations or performance under this Agreement for which Provider's prior written consent is required. No delegation or other transfer will relieve Customer of any of its obligations or performance under this Agreement. Any purported assignment, delegation or transfer in violation of this Section 16.8 is void. This Agreement is binding upon and inures to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns.
    *   No Third-party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.
    *   Amendment and Modification; Waiver. Customer may not amend or modify this Agreement without Provider’s prior written consent. No waiver by any party of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, no failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any rights, remedy, power or privilege arising from this Agreement shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.
    *   Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.
    *   Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction. This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would require or permit the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of New York. All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in accordance with Section 15. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any court order or injunctive relief, the parties hereby irrevocably submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of the courts in New York County, State of New York, USA, with respect to which, to the extent permitted under applicable law, the parties: (a) agree that any action, suit or proceeding relating directly or indirectly to this Agreement will be tried by a judge without a jury; and (b) hereby waive any right to a jury trial in any such action, suit or proceeding.
    *   Equitable Relief. Each party acknowledges and agrees that a breach or threatened breach by such party of any of its obligations under Section 9 or, in the case of Customer, Section 3.3, Section 3.4, Section 4.3, or Section 8s, would cause the other party irreparable harm for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and agrees that, in the event of such breach or threatened breach, the other party will be entitled to equitable relief, including a restraining order, an injunction, specific performance and any other relief that may be available from any court, without any requirement to post a bond or other security, or to prove actual damages or that monetary damages are not an adequate remedy. Such remedies are not exclusive and are in addition to all other remedies that may be available at law, in equity or otherwise.
    *   Attorneys' Fees. In the event that any action, suit, or other legal or administrative proceeding is instituted or commenced by either party hereto against the other party arising out of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs from the non-prevailing party.
    *   Revisions; Continued Use. Provider reserves the right to change any of the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, including any document incorporated herein by reference, at any time and in its sole discretion. Any changes will be effective upon the earlier to occur of: (a) emailing the revised terms and conditions or notice of such changes to Customer at Customer’s email address; or (b) posting the revised terms and conditions on Provider’s website. Customer is responsible for reviewing any revised terms, conditions, policies, guidelines and information and any notices of revisions. CUSTOMER’S CONTINUED USE OF SERVICES FOLLOWING THE EMAILING OR POSTING OF ANY REVISED TERMS AND CONDITIONS OR ANY NOTICE OF SUCH REVISIONS, WILL CONSTITUTE ACCEPTANCE OF THE REVISED TERMS AND CONDITIONS BY CUSTOMER. IF CUSTOMER DOES NOT AGREE TO ANY CHANGES TO THIS AGREEMENT, CUSTOMER MUST STOP ACCEPTING SERVICES FROM PROVIDER, AND PROVIDE WRITTEN NOTICE TO PROVIDER IMMEDIATELY.
    *   Government End User. If Customer is a U.S. government entity or if this Agreement otherwise becomes subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), Customer acknowledges that elements of the Services constitute software and documentation and are provided as “Commercial Items” as defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 and are being licensed to U.S. government Customers as commercial computer software subject to restricted rights described in 48 C.F.R. 2.101, 12.211 and 12.212. If acquired by or on behalf of any agency within the Department of Defense ("DOD"), the U.S. Government acquires this commercial computer software and/or commercial computer software documentation subject to the terms of the Agreement as specified in 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-3 of the DOD FAR Supplement ("DFARS") and its successors. This Section is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFARS, or other clause or provision that addresses government rights in computer software or technical data.
    *   Schedules. Customer will comply with this Agreement and the terms, conditions, policies and guidelines, rules and other information attached as schedules hereto, which are incorporated herein by reference. To the extent there is a conflict between this Agreement and the schedules, the conflict will be resolved by giving precedence in the order specified in such documents, or if not specified, the following order: the applicable Schedule and this Agreement.
