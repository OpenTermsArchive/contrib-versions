Coinbase Cookie Policy
----------------------

Effective Date: July 12 , 2023

* * *

This Cookie Policy explains how Coinbase and its group companies ("**Coinbase**", "**we**", "**us**" and "**our**") use cookies and similar technologies when you visit our websites such as coinbase.com, coinbase.com/exchange, coinbase.com/prime, and other Coinbase managed websites that link to this policy (each a “**Site**” and collectively the "**Sites**"), when you use the Coinbase mobile app, the Coinbase Card App, Coinbase Exchange, Coinbase Prime, Dapp Wallet, or Coinbase Custody application programming interface (“**API**”) or third party applications relying on such APIs (together, our “**Apps**”) and/or when you interact with Coinbase online advertisements or marketing emails (the Sites, Apps and associated services are collectively referred to as the "**Services**"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them. 

In some cases, we may use cookies and similar technologies to collect personal information, or information that becomes personal information if we combine it with other information. In such cases, the [Coinbase Global Privacy Policy](https://coinbase.com/legal/privacy) will apply in addition to this Cookie Policy.

You can review your cookie preferences and update your choices by visiting our [Cookie Preferences Manager](https://www.coinbase.com/cookie-preferences). This is in addition to any other controls that may be available to you.

If you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please submit your request via our Support Portal [here](https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/emails/new).

**1\. WHAT ARE COOKIES?**

Browser cookies are text files with small pieces of data downloaded onto your computer or mobile device. Browser cookies and other similar technologies (collectively called “**Cookies**” in this Cookies Policy) enable websites and apps to store information or facilitate access to information stored on your device to enable certain features and distinguish you from other visitors. These technologies are used by most website and app providers to let users navigate between pages efficiently, ensure security of the webpage or application, understand how their websites are used, remember user preferences and generally improve the user experience. More information on cookies and their use can be found at [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/) or [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

Cookies set by the website operator are called "**first party cookies**" and cookies set by parties other than the website operator are called "**third party cookies”**. You should check the [third-party's website](https://coinbase.com/legal/cookie/third-parties) for more information on how they use cookies.

**2\. WHAT DO WE USE COOKIES FOR?**

When you access our Sites and Services, we, or companies we work with, may place cookies and similar technologies (such as web beacons, software development kits (“**SDKs**”), pixels, APIs, mobile advertising identifiers, tags and local storage) on your computer or other device.

We use cookies for the following purposes:

**Strictly Necessary purposes**

Strictly Necessary Cookies are essential for our Services to function and therefore cannot be switched off. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms. These also include cookies we may rely on for security purposes, such as to prevent unauthorized access attempts. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies at any time, but some features of our Services may not work.

**Performance purposes**

We use these Cookies to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our Services. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the Sites and Apps, and to resolve any errors that occur on the Services quickly to provide you with a better experience. For example, Cookies like our third party JSESSIONID cookie are used to provide analytics on how our Apps perform. This cookie lasts for the duration of your browsing session.

**Functional purposes**

We use these Cookies to remember the choices you make (e.g. country or language selection) and to tailor our Services to your preferences. For example, our first party cm\_default\_preferences cookie remembers your cookie preferences and lasts for 6 months. 

**Targeting purposes**

Coinbase uses first party and third party cookies for advertising and measurement purposes.

These advertising cookies are used to serve personalized advertising on our Services or to serve advertising on other third party sites that may be relevant to you or your interests. This means that after you have been to our Services, you may see advertisements about our Services elsewhere on the Internet.

These cookies are also used to help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. The information collected through this process does not enable these third party service providers to identify your name, contact details or other personal information that directly identifies you. For example, our Google Analytics cookie, \_gat\_gtag, is used to surface targeted Coinbase ads on Google and measure conversion rates. This cookie lasts for 1 minute. 

Our third-party service providers may place cookies on your browser or device to help us keep our Services safe and secure, promote our Services on other apps and websites, and enable us, our advertisers and measurement partners to measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.

**3\. HOW LONG WILL COOKIES STAY ON MY BROWSING DEVICE?**

The length of time a cookie will stay on your browsing device depends on whether it is a "persistent" or "session" cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you close your browser. Persistent cookies are set to automatically expire after a defined duration (for example, a few days, weeks or months). 

**4\. HOW TO MANAGE COOKIES, SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES AND TARGETED ONLINE MOBILE ADVERTISING**

You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies (except strictly necessary cookies). 

You can enable or disable categories of cookies by visiting our [Cookie Preferences Manager](https://www.coinbase.com/cookie-preferences). This includes both first party and third party cookies.
