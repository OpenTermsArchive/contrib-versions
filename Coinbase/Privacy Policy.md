Affiliates



Personal information that we process and collect may be transferred between companies, Services, and employees affiliated with us as a normal part of conducting business and offering our Services to you.

Linked Third Party Websites



When you use third-party services (like when you connect your Coinbase account with your bank account) or websites that are linked through our Services, the providers of those services or products may receive information about you that Coinbase, you, or others share with them. Please note that when you use third-party services or Coinbase Affiliate Services which are not governed by this Privacy Policy, their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those services and products.

TRUST



TRUST is a global, secure, and industry-driven solution designed to comply with a requirement known as the Travel Rule while protecting your security and privacy. Coinbase and other custodial cryptocurrency exchanges and financial institutions share certain basic information about their customers when sending funds over a certain amount to another financial institution. To learn more, see [Travel Rule FinCEN Advisory](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/advisory/advissu7.pdf).

Professional advisors, industry partners, authorities and regulators



We share your information described in [Section 1. What Information We Collect](#what-information-we-collect) with our advisors, regulators, tax authorities, law enforcement, government agencies, and industry partners to:

\- respond pursuant to applicable law or regulations, court orders, legal process or government requests;

Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, merged, reorganized, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control or similar event, your personal information could be one of the assets transferred to the acquiring party. 

Third-Party Service Providers



We work with third-party service providers to help us provide our Services. When we share information with third-party service providers in this capacity, we require them to use your information on our behalf in accordance with our instructions and terms and only process as necessary for the purpose of the contract.

4\. HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

We retain your information as needed to provide our Services, comply with legal obligations, or protect our or others’ interests. While retention requirements vary by country, we maintain internal retention policies on the basis of how information needs to be used. This includes considerations such as when the information was collected or created, whether it is necessary in order to continue offering you our Services, whether we are required to hold the information to comply with our legal obligations, including AML/KYC compliance or other financial regulatory obligations, or information preservation requirements. We also keep certain information where necessary to protect the safety, security and integrity of our Services, Customers, and Users. Our third-party electronic identity verification providers collect and retain biometric information for the period required for financial regulatory compliance or otherwise as required by applicable law. They retain this information for as long as set out in their [applicable notices/policies](https://www.coinbase.com/en-gb/legal/privacy/third-party-verification-vendors). In line with these considerations, we delete information that is no longer needed for the above purposes when you close your account, or when you request deletion of your information (which you can initiate through your [Privacy Rights Dashboard](https://www.coinbase.com/settings/privacy-rights)).

5\. CHILDREN'S PERSONAL INFORMATION

The Sites and Services are not directed to persons under the age of 18, and we do not knowingly request or collect any information about persons under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, please do not provide any personal information through the Sites or Services. If a User or Customer submitting personal information is suspected of being younger than 18 years of age, Coinbase will require the relevant Customer or User to close his or her account, and will take steps to delete the individual’s information as soon as possible.

6\. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS

To facilitate our global operations, Coinbase, its Affiliates, third-party partners, and service providers may transfer, store, and process your personal information throughout the world, including Ireland, Germany, Singapore, the UK, the US, and the Philippines. [See here for more information](https://www.coinbase.com/en-gb/legal/privacy/international-transfers). 

If you reside in the EEA, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom, we rely upon a variety of legal mechanisms to facilitate these transfers of your personal information (collectively, “**European Personal Data**”).

*   We rely primarily on the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses to facilitate the international and onward transfer of European Personal Data to third countries, including from our EU operating entities to Coinbase, Inc. in the United States. For a copy of the Standard Contractual Clauses, please contact dpo@coinbase.com. *   In addition, we may rely on certain exemptions provided for under data protection law for our international transfers. We also rely on [adequacy decisions](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en) from the European Commission where available and exemptions provided for under data protection law. For example, because Coinbase operates and provides its Services globally, we need to share information with our Affiliates and to data centers outside the EEA in order to develop, offer, and improve our Services (Article 49(1)(b) GDPR). In addition, we may rely on certain exemptions for sharing personal information with law enforcement outside of the EEA in emergency situations (Article 49(1)(f) GDPR).
    

EU-US, UK-US, and Swiss-US  Data Privacy Framework

Coinbase complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) (together referred to as the “Data Privacy Frameworks”) and the DPF Principles as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Coinbase has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to:

*   the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF;
    *   the UK-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-UK DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF; and
    *   the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF.  

In the context of an onward transfer, Coinbase has responsibility for the processing of personal data it receives under the DPF and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as a service provider, partner and/or other third party to help us provide our Services on our behalf (as described in Section 4 of this policy). Coinbase remains liable under the DPF if any such third party processes personal data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF, unless Coinbase can prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, visit [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/)  

In compliance with the Data Privacy Frameworks, Coinbase commits to resolve all DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information.  EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of personal data received in reliance on the relevant Data Privacy Frameworks should first contact Coinbase at: [dpo@coinbase.com](mailto:dpo@coinbase.com) 

For unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal information in reliance on the Data Privacy Frameworks, Coinbase is a member of and relies upon the ICDR-AAA services for the Data Privacy Framework Program, see here [https://go.adr.org/dpf\_irm.html](https://go.adr.org/dpf_irm.html), which may involve, under certain conditions, binding arbitration.

The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Coinbase’s compliance with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF).
