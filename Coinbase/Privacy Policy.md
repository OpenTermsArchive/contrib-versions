3\. HOW AND WHY WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION

We work with service providers, partners and other third parties to help us provide our Services, and as a result we need to share certain information with these third parties.  Here’s how:

Affiliates



Personal information that we process and collect may be transferred between companies, Services, and employees affiliated with us as a normal part of conducting business and offering our Services to you. See [Section 11. Our Relationship With You](#our-relationship-with-you) for a list of our affiliated companies and Services.

Linked Third Party Websites



When you use third-party services (like when you connect your Coinbase account with your bank account) or websites that are linked through our Services, the providers of those services or products may receive information about you that Coinbase, you, or others share with them. Please note that when you use third-party services or Coinbase Affiliate Services which are not governed by this Privacy Policy, their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those services and products.

Travel Rule



In accordance with regulations commonly known as the “TraveI Rule” in multiple jurisdictions, Coinbase may collect, retain, and/or share with other service providers information about the counterparties in certain cryptocurrency transfers. For example, Coinbase may collect  counterparty information when you receive a deposit of cryptocurrency from outside of the Coinbase platform or when you send cryptocurrency to a non-Coinbase wallet address. In some instances, Coinbase may further be obligated under the Travel Rule to provide information about you and/or  the counterparty to the virtual asset service provider (or applicable regional equivalent) (“VASP”)  that is transferring cryptocurrency to, or receiving it from, Coinbase. To do this, Coinbase employs  tools such as TRUST (the Travel Rule Universal Solution Technology) – a global, secure, and  industry-driven solution designed to comply with the Travel Rule while helping to protect your security  and privacy.

Professional advisors, industry partners, authorities and regulators



Professional advisors, industry partners (and their service providers), authorities and  regulators. We share your information described in [Section 1. What Information We Collect](#what-information-we-collect) with our advisors, regulators, tax authorities, law enforcement, government agencies, and industry  partners (and their service providers) to: 

a) respond pursuant to applicable law or regulations, court orders, legal process or government requests;  

b) comply with our reporting and information sharing obligations with industry partners,  including other and regulatory authorities;

c) detect, investigate, prevent, or address fraud and other illegal activity or security and  technical issues;

d) protect the rights, property, and safety of our Customers, Coinbase and its Affiliates, or  others, including to prevent death or imminent bodily harm; and

e) to facilitate subscription, transfer or redemption requests.

Asset Transfer or Company Acquisition



We may choose to buy or sell assets, and may share and/or transfer information about our Customers in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, merged, reorganized, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control or similar event, your personal information could be one of the assets transferred to the acquiring party. 

Third-Party Service Providers



We work with third-party service providers to help us provide or  promote our Services. This involves disclosing to our third-party service providers conversion data,  including IP address, with advertisers such as Meta to create custom audience lists and AppLovin.  (See here for more information about AppLovin’s collection and use of your information). These third party service providers will match this information with their user data (gathered in accordance with  their own privacy policies and terms of service) to allow us to target ads to groups of individuals who  have interacted with us. 

When we share  information with third-party service providers in this capacity, we require them to use your information  on our behalf in accordance with our instructions and terms and only process as necessary for the  purpose of the contract.  

We work with different types of third-party service providers, including:

4\. HOW WE HOLD YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

We generally hold your information electronically in our servers or those of our trusted service  providers. On occasion, we hold your information in hard copy. We implement reasonable technical  and organizational safeguards to protect the information we hold, and we require our service  providers to do the same.

5\. HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

We retain your information as needed to provide our Services, comply with legal obligations, or protect our or others’ interests. While retention requirements vary by country, we maintain internal  retention policies on the basis of how information needs to be used. This includes considerations  such as when the information was collected or created, whether it is necessary in order to continue offering you our Services, whether we are required to hold the information to comply with our legal  obligations, including AML/KYC compliance, or other financial regulatory obligations, or information preservation requirements. We also keep certain information where necessary to protect the safety, security and integrity of our Services, Customers, and Users. We may keep pseudonymised personal information (information with identifying details removed or replaced) and your user ID to help us understand usage patterns and improve our services. We retain biometric information (as part of our retention of Supplemental Identification Information) for the period required for financial regulatory compliance or otherwise as required by applicable law. Our third-party electronic identity verification service providers retain this information for as  long as set out in their [applicable notices/policies](https://www.coinbase.com/en-gb/legal/privacy/third-party-verification-vendors). In line with these considerations, we delete information that is no longer needed for the above  purposes when you close your account, or when you request deletion of your information, or if required under applicable law, when you withdraw consent to us using your information (which you can initiate through your [Privacy Rights Dashboard](https://www.coinbase.com/settings/privacy-rights)).

6\. CHILDREN'S PERSONAL INFORMATION

The Sites and Services are not directed to persons under the age of 18, and we do not knowingly request or collect any information about persons under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, please do not provide any personal information through the Sites or Services. If a User or Customer submitting personal information is suspected of being younger than 18 years of age, Coinbase will require the relevant Customer or User to close his or her account, and will take steps to delete the individual’s information as soon as possible.

7\. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS

To facilitate our global operations, Coinbase, its Affiliates, third-party partners, and service providers may transfer, store, and process your personal information throughout the world, including Ireland, Germany, Singapore, the UK, the US, and the Philippines. [See here for more information](https://www.coinbase.com/en-gb/legal/privacy/international-transfers). 

If you reside in the EEA, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom, we rely upon a variety of legal mechanisms to facilitate these transfers of your personal information (collectively, “**European Personal Data**”).

*   We rely primarily on the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses to facilitate the international and onward transfer of European Personal Data to third countries, including from our EU operating entities to Coinbase, Inc. in the United States. For a copy of the Standard Contractual Clauses, please contact dpo@coinbase.com. *   In addition, we may rely on certain exemptions provided for under data protection law for our international transfers. We also rely on [adequacy decisions](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en) from the European Commission where available and exemptions provided for under data protection law. For example, because Coinbase operates and provides its Services globally, we need to share information with our Affiliates and to data centers outside the EEA in order to develop, offer, and improve our Services (Article 49(1)(b) GDPR). In addition, we may rely on certain exemptions for sharing personal information with law enforcement outside of the EEA in emergency situations (Article 49(1)(f) GDPR).
    

EU-US, UK-US, and Swiss-US  Data Privacy Framework

Coinbase complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) (together referred to as the “Data Privacy Frameworks”) and the DPF Principles as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Coinbase has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to:

*   the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF;
    *   the UK-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-UK DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF; and
    *   the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF.  

In the context of an onward transfer, Coinbase has responsibility for the processing of personal data it receives under the DPF and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as a service provider, partner and/or other third party to help us provide our Services on our behalf (as described in Section 4 of this policy). Coinbase remains liable under the DPF if any such third party processes personal data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF, unless Coinbase can prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy  and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles (together, the “Principles”), the Principles shall govern.

To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, visit [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/)  

In compliance with the Data Privacy Frameworks, Coinbase commits to resolve all DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information.  EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of personal data received in reliance on the relevant Data Privacy Frameworks should first contact Coinbase at: [dpo@coinbase.com](mailto:dpo@coinbase.com) 

For unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal information in reliance on the Data Privacy Frameworks, Coinbase is a member of and relies upon the ICDR-AAA services for the Data Privacy Framework Program, see here [https://go.adr.org/dpf\_irm.html](https://go.adr.org/dpf_irm.html), which may involve, under certain conditions, binding arbitration.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Coinbase’s compliance with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF).

If you reside in Brazil, we may rely upon a variety of legal mechanisms to facilitate international data  transfers of your personal information. 

a) We rely primarily on the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the National Data  Protection Authority to facilitate the international and onward transfer of personal data to third  countries, including from our Brazilian subsidiary to Coinbase, Inc. in the United States. The  approved SCCs can also include equivalent SCCs, as provided by Article 20 of Regulation  no. 19/2024 by ANPD. For a copy of the Standard Contractual Clauses, please contact  dpo@coinbase.com 

b) In addition, we may rely on certain exemptions provided for under Brazilian data protection  laws for our international transfers. We also rely on adequacy decisions from the National  Data Protection Authority where available. 

The mechanisms abovementioned will not apply when you have a direct relationship with any  company located outside Brazil, because this situation is not considered an international data  transfer (Article 7, III, of Regulation no. 19/2024, from ANPD). 

If you reside in Argentina, we may rely upon a variety of legal mechanisms to facilitate international  data transfers of your personal information. 

c) We rely primarily on the European Standard Contractual Clauses as set forth above. 

d) In addition, we may rely on certain exemptions provided for under Argentine data protection  laws for our international transfers. We also rely on the adequacy decision issued through  Disposition E60/2016 of the Argentine Data Protection Authority where available.
