Privacy Policy
==============

* * *

In a nutshell
-------------

Olvid does not collect ANY personal data.

Olvid’s technology does not require any personal data to operate : no phone number, no email address, no name, no surname, no address, no birth date… Olvid will never request access to your contacts, your files or any other data that belongs to you. (NB: like any application, Olvid simply uses purely technical data, i.e. users' IP addresses, for its operation, without consulting, collecting or storing them).

\- When installing Olvid, you are not asked to create an account. Identification elements you enter and which are displayed to other users remain locally on your phone, they are never sent to our servers.

\- When you use Olvid, we have access to no information. Absolutely everything is encrypted, data and metadata. We can not learn anything about what users exchange and it is impossible for us to know « who is talking to whom ».

\- If you uninstall the application, no personal data whatsoever remains. It’s as if you had never installed the app.

In detail
---------

The Olvid company attaches great importance to the protection of privacy and data relating to its customers and prospects, but also to its employees, partners and service providers.

Olvid thus ensures that it adopts and complies with the principles applicable to the protection of personal data within the framework of its activity.

The purpose of this **Privacy Policy** (the “Policy”) is to clearly, simply and completely inform any user of this website, and in general any customer or prospect (“You”, “Your” and the “Site”) about the manner in which Olvid (“We”, “Our”), in its capacity as **Data controller**, collects and uses data concerning You and the means You have at Your disposal to control this use and exercise Your rights relating to it.

In addition, specific mentions appear on each collection form in order to ensure that You are fully informed prior to any processing of Your data.

1\. Data controller

2\. Purpose of the processing
-----------------------------

The confidentiality of its Users’ data is Olvid’s priority. All data and metadata are encrypted. Olvid guarantees absolute confidentiality of exchanges and anonymity of users with respect to third parties.

**General mode of operation**. Olvid’s technology does NOT request any personal data in order to operate: no phone number, email, last name, first name, address, date of birth… Olvid does not request access to your contacts, files or any other data that belongs to you.

When you install Olvid you are not asked to create an account. The identification information you enter remains locally on your smartphone and is not transferred to the servers. They are transmitted to the users you decide to contact.

When you use Olvid, we have access to no information. Absolutely everything is encrypted, data and metadata. In particular, it is impossible for us to know what is being exchanged or “who is talking to whom”.

If you uninstall the application, no personal data whatsoever remains. It is as if you had never installed the app.

**Additional elements**. Like any other application, Olvid simply uses purely technical data, i.e. users’ IP addresses, for its operation, without consulting, collecting or storing them.

In its paid version, Olvid processes the data strictly necessary for the invoicing of batches of licenses.

### 2.1. How Do We collect Your Data?

We collect information about You only:

*   when You purchase license packages (as a representative of the entity for which You work),
    
*   when You contact Us or interact with Us by any other means (e-mail, telephone, social networks…),
    
*   when You respond to one of Our satisfaction surveys,
    
*   when You subscribe to Our marketing communications.
    

### 2.2. Why Do We Collect Your Data?

Olvid only collects data that is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which it is processed.

The legal basis on which we collect data is the performance of the contract that binds Us with You when You use Our services or with Your consent.

These purposes are specific and legitimate and, under no circumstances will Your data be further processed in a manner incompatible with these purposes, except with Your prior consent.

Thus, We are likely to use Your data, as the case may be, for:

*   invoice the user licenses,
    
*   respond to Your contact requests,
    
*   manage possible complaints.
    

### 2.3 What data do we collect?

By **Personal Data**, we mean any information allowing us to identify you, directly or indirectly by reference, as the case may be: (i) to an identification number; (ii) to one or more elements specific to you; (iii) or by cross-referencing information. We distinguish between personal data of users and purely technical data on access to the service (IP addresses) and billing.

**For the free version and the sale on the stores:**

*   **The IP address** for the use of the application. We remind you that, like any application, Olvid uses for its operation the IP addresses of users, without consulting, collecting or storing them.

**For the direct sale of license packages:**

As part of the sale of license packages, the information that We may collect and process is as follows:

*   **Your first and last names**\*
*   **Your company’s name**\*
*   **Your contact information (phone and postal address)**\*
*   **Your email**\*
*   **Your bank and financial data**\* to proceed to the billing
*   **Your contact history** with Us to provide you with assistance
*   **The IP address** for the use of the application. We remind you that, like any application, Olvid uses for its operation the IP addresses of the users, without ever consulting, collecting or keeping them.

The **mandatory fields** are those indicated as such by the **symbol (\*)**. If You do not fill in these fields, We will unfortunately not be able to access your request. The other data are optional, i.e. You are free to fill them in, or not, without any particular obligation or inconvenience to You.

3\. Sharing Your Data
---------------------

With whom do We share Your data? The only people authorized to access Your data are the Olvid team members.

Our service providers may also receive personal data that is strictly necessary for the performance of the services entrusted to them and in particular those We call upon to perform the services. We use AWS servers, specifying again that servers do not play any role in security, only IP addresses can be visible by the provider.

We are also likely to communicate Your data in order to respond to legal or regulatory requests, court decisions, subpoenas or legal proceedings, if compliance with the regulations in force requires it, as well as in the event that Olvid transfers all or part of its assets to a third party company.

4\. Retention period
--------------------

How long is your data kept? Your billing data will be kept by Olvid for the period of time that you use Our services, and deleted no later than three years from the last contact, unless anonymized or legally required by law to keep certain data for a longer period of time.

We would like to remind you that purely technical data, i.e. IP addresses, are not stored.

5\. Security conditions
-----------------------

The protection of Your privacy and Your data is a priority. Within Olvid, We take adequate security measures, in particular technical and organizational measures, to protect Your data against accidental loss, destruction, misuse, damage and unauthorized or illegal access.

All persons having access to Your data are bound by a duty of confidentiality and are subject to disciplinary measures and/or other sanctions if they fail to comply with these obligations.
