Google Drive Additional Terms of Service
========================================

Effective Date: October 22, 2025 ([view previous version](https://www.google.com/drive/terms-of-service/archived/31-03-2020/))

To use Google Drive, you must accept (1) [the Google Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms), and (2) these Google Drive Additional Terms of Service (the **“Google Drive Additional Terms”**).

Please read each of these documents carefully. Together, these documents are known as the **“Terms”**. They establish what you can expect from us as you use our services, and what we expect from you.

Although it’s not a part of these Terms, we encourage you to read [our Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) to better understand how you can [update, manage, export, and delete your information](https://myaccount.google.com/).

#### 1\. Your Content

Google Drive allows you to upload, submit, store, send and receive content. As described in the [Google Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms), your content remains yours. We do not claim ownership in any of your content, including any text, data, information, and files that you upload, share, or store in your Drive account. The Google Terms of Service give Google a limited purpose license to operate and improve the Google Drive services — so if you decide to share a document with someone, or want to open it on a different device, we can provide that functionality.

Google Drive also allows you to collaborate on the content of other Google Drive users. The “owner” of the content is the one who controls the content and its use.

Sharing settings in Google Drive allow you to control what others can do with your content in Google Drive. The privacy settings of your files depends on the folder or drive they are in. Files in your individual drive are private, until you decide to share them. You can share your content and can transfer control of your content to other users. Files you create or place in folders or drives shared by others will inherit the sharing settings and may inherit the ownership settings of the folder or drive they are in. We will not share your files and data with others except as described in our Privacy Policy.

We will not use your content for marketing or promotional campaigns.

#### 2\. Program Policies

We may review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our [Program Policies](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/148505), and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But that does not necessarily mean that we review content, so please don’t assume that we do.

#### 3\. Account Suspension and Termination

Before suspending or terminating your account, we’ll provide you with advance notice when reasonably possible, describe the reason for our action, and give you an opportunity to clarify the issue and address it, unless doing so would:

*   cause harm or [liability](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-liability) to a user, third party, or Google,
*   violate the law or a legal enforcement authority’s order,
*   compromise an investigation, or
*   compromise the operation, integrity, or security of our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-services).

Without limiting any of our other rights, Google may suspend or terminate your access to Google Drive or delete your Google Account if any of these things happen:

*   you materially or repeatedly breach these Terms or the Google Terms of Service,
*   we’re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order, or
*   your conduct causes harm or [liability](https://policies.google.com/terms#footnote-liability) to a user, third party, or Google — for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others, or scraping content that doesn’t belong to you.

If you believe your Google Account has been suspended or terminated in error, [you can appeal](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/40695).
