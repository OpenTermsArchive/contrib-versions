Google Drive Additional Terms of Service
========================================

Effective date: 31 March 2020 ([view previous version](https://www.google.com/drive/terms-of-service/archived/))

To use Google Drive, you must accept (1) [the Google Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms), and (2) these Google Drive Additional Terms of Service (the **“Google Drive Additional Terms”**).

Please read each of these documents carefully. Together, these documents are known as the **'Terms'**. They establish what you can expect from us as you use our services, and what we expect from you.

Although it’s not a part of these Terms, we encourage you to read [our Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) to better understand how you can [update, manage, export and delete your information](https://myaccount.google.com/).

#### 1\. Your content

Google Drive allows you to upload, submit, store, send and receive content. As described in the [Google Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms), your content remains yours. We do not claim ownership of any of your content, including any text, data, information and files that you upload, share or store in your Drive account. The Google Terms of Service give Google a limited-purpose licence to operate and improve the Google Drive services — so if you decide to share a document with someone or want to open it on a different device, we can provide that functionality.

Google Drive also allows you to collaborate on the content of other Google Drive users. The 'owner' of the content is the one who controls the content and its use.

Sharing settings in Google Drive allow you to control what others can do with your content in Google Drive. The privacy settings of your files depends on the folder or drive they are in. Files in your individual drive are private, until you decide to share them. You can share your content and can transfer control of your content to other users. Files that you create or place in folders or drives shared by others will inherit the sharing settings and may inherit the ownership settings of the folder or drive they are in. We will not share your files and data with others except as described in our Privacy Policy.

We will not use your content for marketing or promotional campaigns.

#### 2\. Programme Policies

We may review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our [Programme Policies](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/148505), and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But that does not necessarily mean that we review content, so please do not assume that we do.
