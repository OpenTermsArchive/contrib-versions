Community Guidelines
====================

Introduction 
-------------

Guilded was founded with one humble goal _—_ to connect gaming communities. In pursuit of this goal, we've developed a host of features for your community to chat, organize, share content, recruit, and compete with one another.

We recognize that for communities to flourish, players need to be both empowered to express themselves while also feeling safe and free from abuse. To that end, we've drafted a series of Community Guidelines to help communicate how the policies established in our **[Terms of Use](https://support.guilded.gg/hc/en-us/articles/360039728313)** affect our users and servers, and how we can promote diverse conversations across our communities.   

Guidelines
----------

In order to provide a safe and fair environment for our users, some content and activity is not permitted on our services. Content and activity that is not tolerated broadly fall into four categories: 1. Violence and harassment, 2. Objectionable content, 3. Criminal behavior, and 4. Hacking and cheating. In addition, all publicly visible content, including but not limited to profile pictures, banners, team logos, profile posts, and public channel content, must be suitable for ages 13 and up.

### 1\. Violence and harassment

#### Incitement & promotion of violence

You may not share content or engage in activity promoting, celebrating, or instigating real-world violence. This includes but is not limited to glorification of real-world violence, graphic depictions of violence against individuals or groups, credible statements of intent to commit violence or calls for violence against any party.

You may not use our services to coordinate acts of violence, vandalism or property damage, or other criminal activity.

Harassment may include but is not limited to persistent unsolicited messages, threats of any kind, sharing or expressing intent to share private information, evading blocks or bans to persist in unwanted contact with an individual or community, or establishing communities with the explicit or implicit purpose of degrading, threatening, or otherwise targeting an individual or community.

### 2\. Objectionable content

#### Hate speech

You may not engage in hate speech on our services. We generally adhere to the definition of hate speech as messages, media, terms, or rhetoric that attacks or promotes the attack or dehumanization of people or groups on the basis of race, ethnicity, nationality, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or disability. This includes representation, celebration of, or advocacy for groups or movements that have perpetrated atrocities or advocate for violence against protected groups.

#### Graphic content

You may not publish content depicting real-world death and murder, gore, assault, dismemberment, executions, torture, mutilation, suicide or self-harm, or real or simulated sexual abuse or violence. Real and simulated heinous imagery distributed with the perceived intention of shocking or distressing others may be removed without warning, and users engaging in this activity may incur temporary or permanent suspensions.

We recognize that some graphic content may be shared on communication services within the context of discussing or raising awareness for sensitive subjects, and these may be permitted with some limitations.

We recognize the sensitivity and subjectivity of content depicting real-world hunting and encourage individuals sharing content that depicts hunting activities to exercise discretion. Hunting photography that depicts excessive blood or graphic content, or desecration of carcasses, may be removed without warning.

#### Extreme insensitivity

You may not publish or distribute content that celebrates cruelty or explicitly mocks the suffering of victims of violence, disaster, or harassment.
