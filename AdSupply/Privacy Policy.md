**2\. YOUR ARE AN END-USER OF A PUBLISHER’S SITE**

**2.1. What Personal Data Do We Process?**

**If you are an Internet user and you are visiting a website where one of our network ad is displayed (i.e. a publisher’s site) and/or interact with the ad, we are collecting and processing some personal information about you.**

As used in this Privacy Policy, the terms “_personal information_” and “_personal data_” mean information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular individual or household.

The data we collect and process about you does not reflect your name, email address, address, phone numbers, or other data, which could be used to identify you personally. However, the information listed below could be combined with other data to identify or reveal information about you. It may also allow us to recognize your device over time and across websites. Therefore, it may qualify as personal data under applicable laws.

Please also note that we do not collect and/or process any personal data that could be qualified as sensitive according to the applicable laws (in particular, information concerning racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical affiliation or beliefs, trade-union membership, health, sex life or sexual orientation, genetic data or biometric data, criminal convictions or alleged commission of an offense), and we do not allow the Publishers/Advertisers to pass such information to us or target End-Users based on such information.

We use cookies and other tracking technologies (such as pixel tags, and unique advertising identifiers) to collect information about your activity, browser, and device. To learn more about how we use cookies and your choices, please check out our [Cookie Policy](https://www.adsupply.com/cookie-policy/).

The information we collect and/or process about you includes, without limitation:

*   **Device identifiers and related information**, including your IP address, User Agent (as defined below), your operating system (and version), your Internet Service Provider, and  identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser.

The term “User Agent” refers to a text (or a string) sent by your browser to every website you connect with, that identifies the type of device you are using (e.g. desktop, mobile or tablet) and the type and version of your browser. Note that your IP address and your User Agent will be combined and anonymized within a short time after the collection, and we will only store the anonymized combination in our records. However, this data might remain in webserver logs that we usually keep 10-14 days for diagnosis purposes.

*   **Location data**, as extracted or inferred from your IP address, and including your country, State or region, city, zip code, as the case may be. We also collect your time zone, language, and, if you are in the U.S., the Designated Market Area (“DMA code”).
*   **Information about ads served, viewed or clicked on**, including the type of advertisement you interacted with, which advertisement you interacted with, the tracking pixel in the advertisement (if any).

*   **Information that an Advertiser has collected about you and shared with us.** When creating an ad campaign, Advertisers can choose to target only a group of End-Users who had a specific behavior that the Advertisers themselves identified (e.g. an End-User who started the sign-up process on the Advertiser’s site, but did not finish it). Note that, in most of the cases, AdSupply does not know what is the behavior/criteria used by the Advertisers for their ad campaign. Advertisers are free to use any name or identifier to designate such behavior. AdSupply processes it as a numeric identifier and do not connect the meaning of the given name anyhow.  This naming option is provided to Advertisers to help them in the organization of their ad campaign, so that they can create some tags for specific behaviors or audience type.
*   If you are in the U.S., Canada or the UK, **audience segments, including demographic (e.g. age) and interest segments**, as inferred by Lotame Solutions, Inc, which is the data management platform (“DMP”) we are using in order to help Advertisers to reach their audience.

Note that AdSupply is not processing demographic data or your interests directly. Lotame collects online data via the use of Lotame tags, cookies and other technologies, which are placed by us on our Publisher’s sites. This allows Lotame to collect anonymous information from Publishers’ websites. Lotame collects this information on our behalf, as well as on its own behalf.  Lotame aggregates this data into audience segments associated with certain interests, behaviors, and attributes, so that we can offer the possibility to our Advertisers to do demographic or interest-based advertising. To learn more, please read the [Privacy Policy of Lotame](https://www.lotame.com/about-lotame/privacy/lotames-products-services-privacy-policy/).

**2.2. Why Do We Use Your Personal Data?**

We use your personal data for the following purposes:

*   **Serve ads** and **allocate the successful advertisement to a particular business transaction** between a Publisher and an Advertiser.

*   **Geographic targeting:** we give the option to Advertisers to serve ads based on your location, as inferred from your IP address**.** We do not collect and process your exact position or address.

*   **Personalized advertising:** we give the option to Advertisers to customize ads showed to you based on your device related information (e.g. an Advertiser can decide to set up an ad campaign targeting internet users using android and a specific internet service provider). Advertisers can also choose to target only a group of End-Users with a certain behavior or a specific audience type that the Advertisers themselves identified (e.g. an End-User who started the sign-up process on the Advertiser’s site, but did not finish it).
*   **Demographic and interest-based advertising:** If you are located in the U.S., Canada or the UK, Advertisers have the option to customize ads based on demographic segments or the interests that could be inferred from your behavior on the internet. As explained above, in order to permit Advertisers to serve demographic or interest-based advertising, we use a DMP, called Lotame, which collects and organizes your data into a series of demographic and/or interest-based targeting segments.

*   **Reporting on ad campaign and ad performance:** reporting to Advertisers and Publishers in the form of aggregated statistics about the effectiveness of online advertising campaigns (e.g. per country, device, or browser type, etc…).
*   **Fraud detection and prevention**: identifying fraudulent behavior (e.g. invalid clicks/fake traffic) or other unauthorized or illegal activity on the internet.
*   **Analytics:** analyzing campaigns performance and ad display and conduct research and development in order to improve and optimize our services.
*   **Frequency capping:** preventing you from seeing the same ad or type of ad too frequently.

*   **Debugging errors in systems**
    
*   **Respond to requests of competent authorities and/or enforce our legal rights**

**2.3. With Whom Do We Share Your Data?  
**

*   **Entities of our company’s group:** we share your personal information with the following companies of our group based in Luxembourg and Hungary as they are helping us to deliver the ad network related services:
    *   Docler Services Kft, Expo tér 5-7, H-1101, Budapest, Hungary;
    *   Docler Services S.à r.l., Avenue John F. Kennedy, L-1855, Luxembourg, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg;
    *   Ad Supply Holding S.à r.l., Avenue John F. Kennedy, L-1855, Luxembourg, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.
*   **Advertisers/Publishers:** we generally only share anonymized data with the Advertisers or Publishers. As an exception, we may share your IP address and User Agent with Advertisers in the specific case where Advertisers are defining their ad campaign using “macros” and requesting this data for fraud detection purpose.

*   **Partner ad networks:** we may share a portion of your personal data (i.e. IP address and User Agent) with other third-party ad networks or business partners who are interested in serving End-Users advertisements from their own advertisers. Please note, however, that these “_business partners_” are not our legal partners, and nothing herein shall be construed as creating a legal partnership.

*   **Service providers:** we use carefully selected and trusted third parties, who act as service providers. We ensure that they are bound by contractually binding obligations to process information we share with them in accordance with our instructions, this Privacy Policy and all applicable data protection laws.

As we constantly work on the development and enhancement of the technology to support our activity, our third party service providers may regularly change. Such entities mainly belong to the following areas:

*   *   **Data management platform (“DMP”)**: we use a DMP in order to offer the option to advertisers to deliver demographic and/or interest-based advertising to End-Users located in the U.S., Canada and UK only. A DMP collects and organizes data from a variety of sources into segments, so that it could be used to deliver targeted advertising, including advertising based on your interests on the internet. As explained in Section 2.1. “**What Personal Data Do We Process?”**, we use Lotame for this purpose. To learn more, please read the [Privacy Policy of Lotame](https://www.lotame.com/about-lotame/privacy/lotames-products-services-privacy-policy/).
    *   **Business intelligence and analytics:** We use an analytics service provider in order to get a comprehensive view and understanding in relation to campaigns performance and ad display.

*   *   **Fraud detection and prevention:** We use a fraud detection and prevention service provider in order to detect/prevent traffic abnormalities that might corrupt our conversion paths.

*   **Law enforcement agencies or governmental authorities:** We may share information with law enforcement agencies or authorities, if such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with our legal obligations, (b) respond to information requests for fraud investigations and alleged illegal activities, (c) enforce and administer our Terms and Conditions, and or any other applicable rules, and/or (d) protect our rights or defend ourselves against any claims.
*   **Business transfers:** Your information may be transferred to another entity of our group following some internal reorganization or to another third party entity in case of sale, reorganization, restructuring, merger and/or acquisition or any other disposal whatsoever at group or company level resulting that part (more than 50%) or whole of our business (or related assets) is either directly or indirectly transferred or falling under control of a third party acquirer, provided the latter and/or the other group company in case of internal reorganization operates within same or similar line of business as ours and commits to comply with this Privacy Policy.

**2.4. Your Choices and Rights**

*   **Opt-out from targeted advertising**

You have the **right to opt-out from targeted advertising.** In such case, Advertisers will not be able to customize their ads based on certain behaviors or audience type and your data will not be shared with third-party ad networks. If you are located in the U.S., Canada or the UK, we will disable the services of our DMP, so that no demographic or interest-based advertising is served to you.

If you would like to do so, you can send us an email to [support@adsupply.com](mailto:support@adsupply.com) and our Support Team will redirect you to a privacy center page where you can confirm your choice.

Important information:

*   *   In order to be able to detect such choice and stop processing your data in the future, we need to store cookies in your browser (opt-out cookies). Considering the very limited personal data we process about you, this is the only way we can prevent any further processing of your data for such purpose.

This also means that if you delete the cookies from the browser, we will not be able to detect that you opted-out from targeted advertising and we may start again processing your information for such purpose.

*   *   Your opt-out request only applies to the device and browser that you use to confirm your request on our privacy center page. You can visit this page from other devices and browsers if you would like to extend your opt-out request to them.
    *   The opt out does not block or delete cookies and does not prevent the use of cookies or other technologies for purposes other than selecting ads based on specific behavior (as identified by the Advertisers), demographic segments or your interests as inferred from your behavior on the internet. If you opt out, data may still be collected about your web browsing activities and you will still see advertising. Ads may be selected, for example, based on the content of the web page in which they are shown. If you wish to block or delete cookies altogether, you can use web browser settings to do so.

If you are located in the U.S., Canada, or the UK, and you specifically would like to opt-out from the processing of your data by Lotame, our DMP, you can also consult [](https://www.lotame.com/about-lotame/privacy/privacy-manager-opt-out/) .

Our Support Team will provide you with information on actions taken within one month of the date of receipt of your request. In exceptional circumstances, when we face complex or a high number of requests, we may extend this period of response for up to two additional months.

Please note that your rights may be exercised free of charge. However, unfounded or excessive requests, in particular because of their repetitive character, will lead to the payment of a fee.

*   **Data access and data portability:** You have the right to access the personal information that we hold about you by requesting a copy of your personal data free of charge. Upon verification of your identity, your request will be sent to our Support Team.

In certain cases, you may also be entitled to request copies of personal information that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and/or request us to transmit this information to another service provider (where technically feasible).

*   **Rectification of inaccurate or incomplete data:** You have the right to request that we correct any inaccuracies in your personal data.

*   **Data erasure:** If you are a Publisher or Advertiser, we generally retain your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us and to comply with our legal obligations.

If you no longer want us to use your information, you can request that we erase your personal information. Your request will be sent to our Support team who will contact you to learn more about your request. However, if you face any difficulties, please contact us at any time.

Please note that if you request the erasure of your personal information:

*   *   We might retain some of your personal information as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud detection and prevention and enhancing safety. For example, if you are an Advertiser/Publisher, in case we close or suspend your account for fraud or illegal activities, we may retain certain information about you to prevent you from opening a new account in the future. Such information shall also be kept available in case of ongoing judicial proceedings/and or investigations.
    *   We may retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations. For example, we may keep some of your information for tax, legal reporting and auditing obligations.
    *   Some copies of your information (e.g., log records) may remain in our database, but are disassociated from personal identifiers.
    *   In order to protect our site and your personal information from accidental or malicious loss and destruction, we have backup systems. Residual copies of your personal information may not be removed from our backup systems for a limited period of time.
*   **Right to object:** We process your data for a variety of reasons, as explained above. Applicable law may entitle you to require us not to process your personal information for certain specific purposes where such processing is based on legitimate interest. If you object to such processing we will stop processing your personal data for these purposes.

In specific situations, we may have to refuse the execution of your request. This would be the case where we have legitimate grounds to continue such processing or if we have to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.

Please note that you may, at any time, ask us to stop processing your data for any direct marketing activities.

*   **Right to restriction of processing:** You have the right to request that we stop processing your data, while we resolve any issues. Basically, you can restrict the processing of your data in four cases:
    *   You have contested the fact that the personal data we hold about you is accurate. In this case, the processing operations in relation to this data will be put on hold for the period during which this is verified.
    *   You have objected to a processing activity based on legitimate interest(s). In this case, you can require the processing operation to be put on hold while we verify the grounds for processing.
    *   You consider that the processing is unlawful but you request restriction rather than erasure.
    *   We have no further need for the data but you require it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.

Despite your request, we may still continue the processing of your personal data if we have to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims. We will notify you before lifting a restriction.

*   **Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority:** If you consider that our processing of your personal data infringes the GDPR or any other applicable national laws, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (in particular in the Member State where you live, where your place of work is located, or where an alleged infringement of the GDPR took place).

**3.6. Information for California Residents**

If you are a California resident, you have certain special rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”).

*   **Right to “Know” and to Request Deletion:** You have the right to know the categories and specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you. You have the right to know the categories of sources from which the personal information has been collected, the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal information, and the categories of third parties with whom we share personal information.

You also have the right to request deletion of personal information we’ve collected or maintain. Please note, however, that our deletion of your personal information may negatively affect our ability to provide you with services.

To exercise these rights please contact us as provided in Section 1 above.

We may ask you to provide additional information, such as your name, email address, or other basic personal information about you that we already have on file, in order to verify who is making the request. Please note that any requested disclosures will only apply to the 12-month period preceding the request, and you are entitled to request disclosure regarding your personal information twice in any 12-month period.

*   **Personal Information Disclosed:** You also have the right to know what categories of personal information we’ve disclosed for a business purpose, and the third parties to whom that information was disclosed.

In the last 12 months, we’ve disclosed the following categories of information to the following parties: the log data and device information, usage information, transaction information, and information on ad campaign/display, as described above, with our third-party service providers as necessary for them to assist us with running our business.

*   **Your Right to Non-Discrimination**: You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment for the exercise of the privacy rights conferred by the CCPA, including but not limited to by denying you services, charging different prices or rates, or providing you with a different level or quality of services.
*   **Your Right to Use an Authorized Agent:** You have the right to designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. To designate an authorized agent, please contact us as provided in Section 1 above. In order to verify you have authorized an agent we will require a signed, written authorization from you.

As regards the data of the End Users of our Publishers’ sites, we have implemented a highly secure technology, which anonymizes their IP address and User Agent in a very short time after collection.

We actively implement data loss prevention systems against leakage, theft and data breach in order to ensure that our site and the entire IT infrastructure related to it are updated against the latest network security vulnerabilities. We periodically test our IT systems, including penetration tests.
