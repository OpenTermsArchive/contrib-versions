In general, to every new Publisher, the Company offers the Post-Pay Model, however, the Company has the right to decide at its own discretion if a Publisher is eligible for a Pre-Pay Model based on Company’s sole evaluation of the quality of the traffic redirected from the Publisher’s Website(s) towards the Advertiser’s Website(s), taking into account the amount of claims, remarks or comments the Company receives from time to time from the Advertisers. Any specific payment terms shall always be specified in the IO.

**Payout Types**. The Publisher and the Company shall agree upon several Payout Types, which shall be specified in the IO, like Revenue Share, Flat CPM, Flat Monthly, Floor CPM or otherwise.
