To avoid confusion and animosity, Groups wishing to name themselves after trademarked properties must include a further description in its name of the type of Group it expects to be such as "Master Photoshop Tutorials" instead of simply "Photoshop."

**20\. Suspension and Termination of Access and Membership**

All payments are to be made in US dollars and prices are subject to change at any time.

Any purchase made via the Shop is between the user and the purchaser only. DeviantArt only provides the platform in which such purchase is available, but in any event will not be responsible for the purchased item, its quality, terms, price etc.

Before making a purchase, we advise you to review the listing and specifications to make sure they fit your needs and are acceptable by you.

**22\. Cryptocurrency**

DeviantArt enables cryptocurrency payments and earnings withdrawals via a Third Party Software blockchain/cryptocurrency payment processor ("**Cryptocurrency Payment Services**").

You acknowledge and agree that regardless of the manner in which such Cryptocurrency Payment Services may be offered to you, DeviantArt merely acts as an intermediary platform between you and the applicable Cryptocurrency Payment Services provider, and shall not be in any way responsible or liable with respect to any services provided by such Cryptocurrency Payment Services provider.

Any and all use of Cryptocurrency Payment Services shall be done solely at your own risk and responsibility, and may be subject to certain legal and financial terms which govern Cryptocurrency Payment Services, which you are encouraged to review and understand before using such services. Additionally, the use of Cryptocurrency Payment Services is subject to the applicable terms of use of the Cryptocurrency Payment Services provider, including but not limited to the lists of prohibited items and businesses not supported by such provider. In the case of BitPay, your use of Cryptocurrency Payment Services is subject to BitPay's [terms of use](https://bitpay.com/legal/terms-of-use/). Each Cryptocurrency Payment Services provider may support different cryptocurrencies, however DeviantArt has full discretion regarding which cryptocurrencies will be available through the Cryptocurrency Payment Services on the DeviantArt platform. Please avoid paying in unsupported cryptocurrencies, as doing so may result in loss of funds.

While we hope to avoid such instances, DeviantArt may, at any time and at its sole discretion, suspend, disable access to or remove Cryptocurrency Payment Services without any liability to you or to any third party.

You assume the volatility risk of the cryptocurrencies in which cryptocurrency transactions occur.

Any refunds of cryptocurrency transactions are subject to DeviantArt's sole discretion.

**23\. DeviantArt Protect**

DeviantArt enables you to use its DeviantArt Protect service (for qualifying images submitted as deviations), in order to detect potential infringements of your images that you submitted. By using DeviantArt Protect, you agree and acknowledge the following:

The DeviantArt Protect service is limited to detecting potentially similar or near-identical images to your images identified on DeviantArt. There might be other similar images that we will not detect, and therefore, we encourage you to keep track of existing works.

To use DeviantArt Protect, you will need to open an account with DeviantArt and agree to these terms and to the DeviantArt general privacy policy.

For images eligible for the DeviantArt Protect service, when a potential infringement is identified, we will send you a notice via email or via platform notification of any potential similar image found. Upon receiving such a notice, you may choose to take action regarding such images or not (for example, by filing a DMCA takedown notice). If you believe that one of the results in our notification is infringing, we encourage you to take relevant actions. We will not cause or initiate any legal procedures with respect to the similar images on our own. DeviantArt will not be responsible, in any event, for such procedures. All results are indicating some similarity, but in no event will we determine or suggest if such work is indeed infringing or not.

For Core Members, we provide the DeviantArt Protect service for all images published as deviations. For non-Core users, we offer the DeviantArt Protect service for 90 days as of the day when the image was submitted as a deviation.

**Services Fees**

Your use of Cryptocurrency Payment Services is subject to certain fees and exchange rates ("**Service Fees**"), which may be modified from time to time. For more information, see [here](https://www.deviantartsupport.com/en//article/what-are-the-costs-for-withdrawing-your-earnings-from-deviantart). The Service Fees shall be deducted from your DeviantArt Earnings Account. All Service Fees are non-refundable.

Certain transactions (e.g., underpayment and overpayment of cryptocurrency transactions) may be subject to additional fees by the Cryptocurrency Payment Services provider. In the case of BitPay, please refer to the following [article](https://support.bitpay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000051746-How-to-claim-a-refund-from-a-BitPay-merchant-refund-email) for additional information.

**24\. Data Scraping & Machine Learning Activities**

DeviantArt is a community of creators that invests significant time and resources to protect its users and foster a cooperative and collaborative environment. Out of respect for its users' choices, DeviantArt has developed clear directives to communicate when its users do not consent to their Content being downloaded and used by third parties for the purposes of developing or operating artificial intelligence or other machine learning systems ("Artificial Intelligence Purposes"). Unless you actively give your consent, for Artificial Intelligence Purposes, DeviantArt will include a robots meta tag with the "noai" or "noimageai" directive in the head section of the HTML page associated with that Content on the Site, and will include an X-Robots-Tag HTTP response header with the "noai" directive when media files associated with that Content are downloaded from the Service. DeviantArt encourages adoption of these directives across other creative platforms, so that creators are able to share their artistic creations with online audiences without fear of losing control of their own works.

DeviantArt expects all users accessing the Service or the Site to respect creators' choices about the acceptable use of their Content, including for Artificial Intelligence Purposes. When a DeviantArt user does not consent to third party use of their Content for Artificial Intelligence Purposes, other users of the Service and third parties accessing the Site are prohibited from using such Content (labeled as "noai" and/or "noimageai") (i) to train an artificial intelligence system, (ii) as input into any previously trained artificial intelligence system, or (iii) to make available any derivative copy unless usage of that copy is subject to conditions at least as restrictive as those set out here. Automated systems or users that fail to respect these choices will be considered to have breached these Terms.

DeviantArt provides no guarantees that "noai" or "noimageai" directives will be present each time Content is accessed, even if the creator does not consent to use of that Content for Artificial Intelligence Purposes; and absence of such directives does not imply creator consent has been granted.

Users acknowledge that by uploading Content to DeviantArt, third-parties may scrape or otherwise use their works without permission. DeviantArt provides no guarantees that third parties will not include certain Content in external data sources, or otherwise use a creator's work for Artificial Intelligence Purposes, even when such directives are present. By prohibiting such conduct, DeviantArt makes no guarantees that it will pursue each unauthorized use of the Service, and the owners of the works are responsible for policing their own works to the extent permitted by law.

* **Exclusive Deviation:** An Exclusive Deviation is a one-of-a-kind work (media, image, or video) that is published as a Deviation and offered for sale to an exclusive Owner (as defined below) on the DeviantArt platform.
    
    **i. As a seller:**
    
    1. You can offer a Deviation for purchase by another user as an Exclusive, which is a one-of-a-kind work of which the purchaser will be the exclusive Owner (as defined below) on DeviantArt.
        
        1. 1\. Before submitting a Deviation for sale as an “Exclusive,” you must make sure that you have all rights (including copyrights) to that work, and that you are the original and only owner of it at the time you offer it for sale.
        2. 2\. Once you list a Deviation for sale as an Exclusive, you may not make copies of it and offer them for sale on DeviantArt.
        3. 3\. When submitting a Deviation for sale as an “Exclusive,” you must select certain parameters for the sale of your Exclusive Deviation. For example, you may choose to offer your work for sale at a fixed price \[in which case, the first DeviantArt user who makes a purchase request at that price will become the Owner (as defined below)\]. Alternatively, you may choose to offer your Deviation for sale as accepting offers (with a minimum offer price) \[in which case, other users of DeviantArt may submit their purchase offers, and at the end of the duration of the sale you may accept any offer you choose, qualified with the chosen parameters\].
        4. 4\. At all times, unless you specifically agree otherwise between yourself and the buyer, you shall be the sole owner of the intellectual property associated with your work.
        5. 5\. You may select to permit your Exclusive Deviation to be offered for resale on the DeviantArt platform, or to restrict such option. Learn more about Exclusive Resale [here](https://www.deviantartsupport.com/en/article/how-do-i-resell-an-exclusive-ive-bought).
        6. 6\. Even if your Exclusive Deviation is purchased, it will still be displayed in your profile Gallery. In such cases, both your username (as the Creator) and the purchaser’s username (as the Owner, as defined below) will appear on the Deviation.
        7. 7\. If you wish to delete an Exclusive Deviation that was purchased, you must obtain consent from the current Owner before deleting.
        
    
    **ii. As a buyer:**
    
    1. Before making a purchase of an Exclusive Deviation, you must carefully read these terms and also the specifications listed by the seller, that may apply to your purchase.
        
        1. 1\. When purchasing an Exclusive Deviation that was offered for sale at a fixed price, if you are the first to submit a purchase request that meets the criteria specified by the Seller, you will immediately become the “Owner” (as defined below) of that Deviation. If the work purchased is available for resale, follow the instructions below.
        2. 2\. When purchasing an Exclusive Deviation that was offered for sale as accepting Offers (with a minimum price), you can submit as many offers as you wish for as long as the sale is still live. The Seller can choose to accept any offer they want, at their sole discretion (it does not have to be the highest offer). As long as the sale is live, you can withdraw your offer at any time. Once the sale duration is over, you can no longer withdraw your offer, and if the Seller chooses your offer as the accepted offer, you will immediately become the “Owner” (as defined below) of that Deviation. If the work purchased is available for resale, follow the instructions below.
        3. 3\. When you purchase an Exclusive Deviation as a Buyer, either for a fixed price or for an Offer (minimum price), the purchased Exclusive Deviation may be displayed in the Exclusives tab on your DeviantArt profile. In such a case, it will be shown in your Profile for as long as you are listed as the Owner of it (as defined below). The Exclusive Deviation will also be shown on the Creator’s profile Gallery. Both the Seller’s username (as the Creator) and your username (as the Owner, as defined below) will appear on the Deviation.
        4. 4\. Unless otherwise specifically agreed between you and the Seller, the Seller shall be at all times the sole owner of the intellectual property associated with the Deviation purchased. Your rights to the work will be in accordance with the specifications and terms decided by the Seller.
        
    
    **Exclusive Ownership:**
    
    1. When you become the “Owner” of a certain Exclusive Deviation that you purchased, it means that you are the current holder of that Deviation on the DeviantArt platform. This simply means that you are the owner of it, subject to the terms presented by the Exclusive Deviation Seller and these terms. Once an Exclusive Deviation is successfully purchased, both the Seller’s username (as the Creator) and the Buyer’s username (as the Owner) will appear on the Deviation. The Exclusive Deviation will be displayed both in the Seller’s profile Gallery and in the Buyer’s profile depending on their settings.
        
    
    **Resale:**
    
    1. Exclusive Deviation Sellers may choose to allow Buyers to resell the Exclusive Deviation they initially purchased from them on DeviantArt's platform. **If resale is permitted, the Exclusive Deviation can only be resold as an Exclusive Deviation on the DeviantArt platform. No other resale method (such as Premium Downloads or Premium Galleries) is permitted.**
        
        1. 1\. When resale is permitted, the Buyer can offer the Exclusive Deviation for resale. The Buyer then becomes the new “Seller” and chooses certain criteria under which the work will be resold (see “As a Seller” section above, excluding if the work is available for another resale or not). **Resale must be made via the resale button on the DeviantArt platform. You may not upload a copy of your purchase and offer it for sale.**
        2. 2\. When the Resale option is available, the original creator (namely, the original Seller) will receive the royalties specified [here](https://www.deviantartsupport.com/en/article/how-do-i-resell-an-exclusive-ive-bought) on any future resale purchases (minus applicable platform fees). This royalty will be handled automatically by the DeviantArt platform and paid directly to the original creator, and resale Sellers do not need to transfer any payments directly to the original creator themselves.
        3. 3\. When an Exclusive deviation is successfully purchased via resale, the new Buyer will become the current Owner (as defined above), and the chain of ownership will always appear on the Exclusive Deviation (namely, it will list the usernames of the creator, the previous owners, and the current owner), the date of purchase, and the purchase price.
