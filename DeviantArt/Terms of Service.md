Commercial activities mean the offering, solicitation or sale of goods or services by anyone other than DeviantArt. Commercial activities with respect to the arts are permitted for registered members acting as individuals, for small corporations or partnerships engaged primarily in art-related activities in which one or more of the principals is a registered member or for those seeking to retain the services or works of a registered member. Commercial activities in the form of paid advertising on the Service are subject to the terms and conditions relating to the purchase of such advertising.

As a registered member of the Service, you will also be able to participate as an administrator or member of a "Group" which is a set of user pages and applications formed for the purpose of collecting content, discussions and organizing members of the site with common interests. Further information about Groups can be found in our Etiquette Policy.

DeviantArt will respond to such objections by requiring an appropriate change in the name of the Group. The use of trademarks and trade names in Group names otherwise must be descriptive of Group activity or purpose. To avoid confusion and animosity, Groups wishing to name themselves after trademarked properties must include a further description in its name of the type of Group it expects to be such as "Master Photoshop Tutorials" instead of simply "Photoshop."

**20\. Suspension and Termination of Access and Membership**

You agree that DeviantArt may at any time, and without notice, suspend or terminate any part of the Service, or refuse to fulfill any order, or any part of any order or terminate your membership and delete any Content stored on the DeviantArt Site, in DeviantArt's sole discretion, if you fail to comply with the Terms or applicable law.

All payments are to be made in US dollars and prices are subject to change at any time.

Any purchase made via the Shop is subject to these Terms, including Section 25 below.

Before making a purchase, we advise you to review the listing and specifications to make sure they fit your needs and are acceptable by you.

**22\. Cryptocurrency**

DeviantArt enables cryptocurrency payments and earnings withdrawals via a Third Party Software blockchain/cryptocurrency payment processor ("**Cryptocurrency Payment Services**").

You acknowledge and agree that regardless of the manner in which such Cryptocurrency Payment Services may be offered to you, DeviantArt merely acts as an intermediary platform between you and the applicable Cryptocurrency Payment Services provider, and shall not be in any way responsible or liable with respect to any services provided by such Cryptocurrency Payment Services provider.

Any and all use of Cryptocurrency Payment Services shall be done solely at your own risk and responsibility, and may be subject to certain legal and financial terms which govern Cryptocurrency Payment Services, which you are encouraged to review and understand before using such services. Additionally, the use of Cryptocurrency Payment Services is subject to the applicable terms of use of the Cryptocurrency Payment Services provider, including but not limited to the lists of prohibited items and businesses not supported by such provider. In the case of BitPay, your use of Cryptocurrency Payment Services is subject to BitPay's [terms of use](https://bitpay.com/legal/terms-of-use/). Each Cryptocurrency Payment Services provider may support different cryptocurrencies, however DeviantArt has full discretion regarding which cryptocurrencies will be available through the Cryptocurrency Payment Services on the DeviantArt platform. Please avoid paying in unsupported cryptocurrencies, as doing so may result in loss of funds.

While we hope to avoid such instances, DeviantArt may, at any time and at its sole discretion, suspend, disable access to or remove Cryptocurrency Payment Services without any liability to you or to any third party.

You assume the volatility risk of the cryptocurrencies in which cryptocurrency transactions occur.

Any refunds of cryptocurrency transactions are subject to DeviantArt's sole discretion.

**Services Fees**

Your use of Cryptocurrency Payment Services is subject to certain fees and exchange rates ("**Service Fees**"), which may be modified from time to time. For more information, see [here](https://www.deviantartsupport.com/kb/en/article/how-do-i-withdraw-earnings-using-bitpay). The Service Fees shall be deducted from your DeviantArt Earnings Account. All Service Fees are non-refundable.

Certain transactions (e.g., underpayment and overpayment of cryptocurrency transactions) may be subject to additional fees by the Cryptocurrency Payment Services provider. In the case of BitPay, please refer to the following [article](https://support.bitpay.com/hc/en-us) for additional information.

**23\. DeviantArt Protect**

DeviantArt enables you to use its DeviantArt Protect service (for qualifying images submitted as deviations), in order to detect potential infringements of your images that you submitted. By using DeviantArt Protect, you agree and acknowledge the following:

1.  The DeviantArt Protect service is limited to detecting potentially similar or near-identical images to your images identified on DeviantArt. There might be other similar images that we will not detect, and therefore, we encourage you to keep track of existing works.
2.  To use DeviantArt Protect, you will need to open an account with DeviantArt, and agree to these terms and to the DeviantArt [general privacy policy](https://www.deviantart.com/about/policy/privacy/).
3.  For images eligible for the DeviantArt Protect service, when a potential infringement is identified, we will send you a notice via email or via platform notification, of any potential similar image found. Upon receiving such a notice, you may choose if you wish to take action regarding such images or not (for example, by filing a DMCA takedown [notice](https://www.deviantart.com/contact-us?menuId=copyright_dmca_holder#issue-response)).
4.  We will not cause or initiate any legal procedures with respect to the similar images. If you believe that one of our results is infringing upon your image, we encourage you to take the proper reporting steps. DeviantArt will not be responsible, in any event, for such procedures. All results are indicating some similarity, but in no event will we determine or suggest if such work is indeed infringing or not.
5.  For Core Members, we provide the DeviantArt Protect service for all images published as deviations. For non-Core users, we offer the DeviantArt Protect service for 90 days as of the day when the image was submitted as a deviation.

**24\. Data Scraping & Machine Learning Activities**

DeviantArt is a community of creators that invests significant time and resources to protect its users and foster a cooperative and collaborative environment. Out of respect for its users' choices, DeviantArt has developed clear directives to communicate when its users do not consent to their Content being downloaded and used by third parties for the purposes of developing or operating artificial intelligence or other machine learning systems ("Artificial Intelligence Purposes"). Unless you actively give your consent, for Artificial Intelligence Purposes, DeviantArt will include a robots meta tag with the "noai" or "noimageai" directive in the head section of the HTML page associated with that Content on the Site, and will include an X-Robots-Tag HTTP response header with the "noai" directive when media files associated with that Content are downloaded from the Service. DeviantArt encourages adoption of these directives across other creative platforms, so that creators are able to share their artistic creations with online audiences without fear of losing control of their own works.

DeviantArt expects all users accessing the Service or the Site to respect creators' choices about the acceptable use of their Content, including for Artificial Intelligence Purposes. When a DeviantArt user does not consent to third party use of their Content for Artificial Intelligence Purposes, other users of the Service and third parties accessing the Site are prohibited from using such Content (labeled as "noai" and/or "noimageai") (i) to train an artificial intelligence system, (ii) as input into any previously trained artificial intelligence system, or (iii) to make available any derivative copy unless usage of that copy is subject to conditions at least as restrictive as those set out here. Automated systems or users that fail to respect these choices will be considered to have breached these Terms.

DeviantArt provides no guarantees that "noai" or "noimageai" directives will be present each time Content is accessed, even if the creator does not consent to use of that Content for Artificial Intelligence Purposes; and absence of such directives does not imply creator consent has been granted.

Users acknowledge that by uploading Content to DeviantArt, third-parties may scrape or otherwise use their works without permission. DeviantArt provides no guarantees that third parties will not include certain Content in external data sources, or otherwise use a creator's work for Artificial Intelligence Purposes, even when such directives are present. By prohibiting such conduct, DeviantArt makes no guarantees that it will pursue each unauthorized use of the Service, and the owners of the works are responsible for policing their own works to the extent permitted by law.

**31\. Identifying where Your Content was created with Generative AI Programs or AI Tools**

Where your Content is offered for sale on DeviantArt (including Commissions, Premium Downloads, Premium Galleries, Subscriptions, and Exclusives) and was created using Generative AI Programs or AI Tools, you must clearly tag or label your Content using as “Created using AI tools”. Where your Content is not being offered for Sale on DeviantArt and was created using Generative AI Programs or AI Tools, we recommend that you clearly tag or label your Content using as “Created using AI tools”.

With regards to the [DreamUp Service](https://www.deviantart.com/dreamup), content generated using the DreamUp Service will automatically be tagged as created with DreamUp. For more information about the DreamUp service, [read here](https://www.deviantartsupport.com/en/dreamup) or [read the DreamUp policy](https://www.deviantart.com/about/policy/dreamup/).

Any content uploaded to the Site that has been tagged, labeled, or otherwise marked “Created using AI tools” via the functionality provided by the platform will be known as “Created Using AI Tools Content.” You are solely responsible for complying with the requirement to tag or label your content as “Created Using AI Tools Content” on DeviantArt.

Under this Agreement, your Content is considered to be created using Generative AI Programs or AI Tools where the primary or material portion of your Content is generated with Generative AI Programs or AI Tools, whether characters, backgrounds, or other major elements. Your Content is not considered to be created using Generative AI Programs or AI Tools merely for use of features that solely operate on your Content (e.g. content-aware fill) or that don't introduce material Generative AI elements into your work (e.g. AI based image upscaling).
