Wolfram|Alpha General Terms of Use
==================================

[Wolfram|Alpha Pro Terms of Use »](https://www.wolframalpha.com/termsofuse/pro)

The Wolfram|Alpha website (our “service”) gives you free access to broad computational resources, including powerful servers running complex algorithms at your request, large volumes of reliable and carefully curated data, and an innovative computation and delivery mechanism that provides you with expertly designed presentations and visualizations.

We are continually working to improve and expand Wolfram|Alpha, creating new algorithms for computation, linguistic analysis, data comprehension, and computational aesthetics to provide you with smart and attractive results. Much of the data is dynamically updated or subjected to periodic manual curation in an effort to provide you with the most current and most reliable data available.

Our goal is to provide the broadest possible free public access to our advanced computation and rich sources of data. To protect our servers, algorithms, and data collections from abuse or exploitation by a small number of users, and because some of the data we make available comes from third parties that impose conditions on its distribution, we need you to agree to, and abide by, the Terms of Use defined below.

These terms are a contract you have to agree to before using the Wolfram|Alpha service. If you are under age 18 you may use Wolfram|Alpha only if you have permission from a parent, legal guardian, or teacher. By using the service, you are telling us either that you are over the age of 18 and legally able to form contracts or that an adult with authority to act on your behalf has agreed to these terms and to be responsible for ensuring your compliance with them in your use of the service and any results you obtain from it. If you don’t want to be bound by these terms, do not use the service or its results. However, you may want to consider one of our paid subscription options, which offer modified terms of use that may be more desirable to you. Please [contact us](https://www.wolframalpha.com/contact-us) for more information about the subscription options available.

Our intention is to make Wolfram|Alpha available to everyone indefinitely. To achieve this, we reserve the right to cut off use by those who abuse the service, or to limit access in any other way for any reason. We are counting on the users of Wolfram|Alpha to embrace our goals and to support them by adhering to these terms.

Methods of Access
-----------------

The Wolfram|Alpha service may be used only by a human being using a conventional web browser to manually enter queries one at a time. Because Wolfram|Alpha is doing computation, not just lookup, each query may require significant CPU time on multiple parallel servers. Any attempt to use a robot, script, or organized group of humans to repeatedly access Wolfram|Alpha could place an unacceptable load on the system, and is strictly forbidden.

If our monitoring systems detect an attempt to access the service in a forbidden way, to execute systematic patterns of queries, to index the website, or to do anything else that we feel jeopardizes the integrity of our system or access to it by other users, we may terminate or suspend access to the service for specific users or IP ranges.

### Ways You May Use Our Free Service and Its Results

The free Wolfram|Alpha service is available for ad hoc, personal, non-commercial use only. For such use you are welcome to download results, print copies, store downloaded content on your computer, and reference this information in your documents. You may use it to get information for your own use for any purpose, including occasional purposes related to your job, as long as you aren’t specifically being paid to use Wolfram|Alpha.

Systematic professional or commercial use of the website, or use for which you are being specifically paid, requires a commercial license. If you are interested in a version of Wolfram|Alpha that allows such use, please [contact us](https://products.wolframalpha.com/contact-us/#custom).

It is permitted to use and post individual, incidental results or small groups of results from Wolfram|Alpha on non-commercial websites and blogs, provided those results are properly credited to Wolfram|Alpha (see [Attribution and Licensing](#attributionandlicensing) below). It is not permitted to extract multiple pieces of data and reassemble them into anything with the characteristics of a data service, database, or source of large and systematic collections of data. You are not allowed to use Wolfram|Alpha to create something that is likely or intended to be reused as a data source for further processing, or that in some other way serves as a replacement or alternative to using Wolfram|Alpha itself. This applies whether what you create is in electronic or print form.

It is not permitted to use Wolfram|Alpha indirectly through any user interface that has created a large number of deep links to Wolfram|Alpha, or that automatically constructs links based on input that you give to that interface rather than through Wolfram|Alpha. You may not in effect use Wolfram|Alpha through any alternate user interface.

Finally, it’s also not permitted to use frames, browser technologies, or any user interface to embed or surround the Wolfram|Alpha website with your own material without permission from Wolfram|Alpha. If you are interested in using Wolfram|Alpha in an embedded way, please [contact us](https://products.wolframalpha.com/contact-us/#custom).

Attribution and Licensing
-------------------------

As Wolfram|Alpha is an authoritative source of information, maintaining the integrity of its data and the computations we do with that data is vital to the success of our project. We generate information ourselves, and we also gather, compare, contrast, and confirm data from multiple external sources. Where we have used external sources of data we list the source or sources we relied on, but in most cases the assemblages of data you get from Wolfram|Alpha do not come directly from any one external source. In many cases the data you are shown never existed before in exactly that way until you asked for it, so its provenance traces back both to underlying data sources and to the algorithms and knowledge built into the Wolfram|Alpha computational system. As such, the results you get from Wolfram|Alpha are correctly attributed to Wolfram|Alpha itself.

If you make results from Wolfram|Alpha available to anyone else, or incorporate those results into your own documents or presentations, you must include attribution indicating that the results and/or the presentation of the results came from Wolfram|Alpha. Some Wolfram|Alpha results include copyright statements or attributions linking the results to us or to third-party data providers, and you may not remove or obscure those attributions or copyright statements. Whenever possible, such attribution should take the form of a link to Wolfram|Alpha, either to the front page of the website or, better yet, to the specific query that generated the results you used. (This is also the most useful form of attribution for your readers, and they will appreciate your use of links whenever possible.)

Failure to properly attribute results from Wolfram|Alpha is not only a violation of these terms, but may also constitute academic plagiarism or a violation of copyright law. Attribution is something we expect you to give us in exchange for us having provided you with a high-quality free service.

The specific images, such as plots, typeset formulas, and tables, as well as the general page layouts, are all copyrighted by Wolfram|Alpha at the time Wolfram|Alpha generates them. A great deal of scholarship and innovation is included in the results generated and displayed by Wolfram|Alpha, including the presentations, collections, and juxtapositions of data, and the choices involved in formulating and composing mathematical results; these are also protected by copyright.

You may use any results, including copyrighted results, from Wolfram|Alpha for personal use and in academic or non-commercial publications, provided you comply with these terms.

If you want to use copyrighted results returned by Wolfram|Alpha in a commercial or for-profit publication, we will usually be happy to grant you a low- or no-cost license to do so. To request a commercial-use license, use [this form](https://products.wolframalpha.com/contact-us/#custom) and provide the input for which you want to use the corresponding output along with information concerning the nature of your proposed use. Your request will be reviewed and answered as quickly as is practical.

Images in Wolfram|Alpha: While many images in Wolfram|Alpha are in the Public Domain, certain images, including various icons and logos, are presented in Wolfram|Alpha in low resolution (thumbnail size) and are displayed under Fair Use and solely for representative purposes. As such, these images may retain the copyright or trademark rights of their respective owners or developers and may not be copied or republished.

Linking to Wolfram|Alpha
------------------------

We are happy for you to link to the Wolfram|Alpha website, including deep links to specific results. However, if you are constructing a very large number of deep links, or any deep links that are created automatically in response to user input given on your site, you must take into account the restrictions enumerated in the section "[Ways You May Use Our Free Service and Its Results](#waystouse)." If you construct a website that induces others to use our service contrary to those terms, you are inducing them to violate our Terms of Use, and can be liable for those violations.

Input Ownership and Privacy
---------------------------

By putting input into Wolfram|Alpha in the form of a query, you are not relinquishing any of your ownership or rights to the content. By providing it to us in query form, you agree that we can store it in log files, and use it to generate the results given back to you. We may also use stored inputs to evaluate performance of the website or study usage patterns, for example examining inputs that seem to create problems for the system, or testing new versions of the system against logs of previous inputs.

We will not attempt to associate individual Wolfram|Alpha inputs with individual human users, and will not release individual or aggregated lists of inputs, or any personally identifiable information, to any third party, except in response to lawful court orders. We will not attempt to assert intellectual property rights over anything given as input to Wolfram|Alpha simply on the basis of its having been given to us as input. For more details, see our [Privacy Policy](https://www.wolfram.com/legal/privacy/wolfram/).

We do not collect or solicit personal information from users of the free Wolfram|Alpha service.

Data Mining and Reverse Engineering
-----------------------------------

The Wolfram|Alpha service uses large collections of data aggregated from many sources, and sophisticated computational and natural language processing algorithms. You may not use multiple queries or specially constructed queries in an attempt to extract large datasets, to reverse engineer the algorithms used by Wolfram|Alpha, or to probe for vulnerabilities.

Spidering, data-mining, scraping, or probing Wolfram|Alpha, or otherwise attempting to abuse the service, is not only a violation of these terms but may also constitute violation of federal and state laws concerning unauthorized access to computer systems.

You are forbidden to violate or attempt to violate the security of the website. If you find a way to crash the website or otherwise get it to misbehave, or you identify a vulnerability, flaw, or bug, please use the feedback form on any Wolfram|Alpha page, or [click here](https://www.wolframalpha.com/contact-us), to report the problem. As there will no doubt always be ways to cause trouble for the site, we ask for your cooperation in ensuring that it remains available for use by everyone.

The material from the Wolfram|Alpha service is intended to be used by a human being in the form in which it is delivered. You are not allowed to systematically extract data from the results returned by Wolfram|Alpha and build them into a new raw data table or source, except on an ad hoc basis for personal use. See "[Ways You May Use Our Free Service and Its Results](#waystouse)" above for further details.

Professional Disclaimers and Disclaimer of Warranty
---------------------------------------------------

Wolfram|Alpha provides a rich and wide range of computations and data in many subject areas, and extensive efforts are made to keep its contents accurate and up to date. It is not, however, a certified or definitive source of information that can be relied on for legal, financial, medical, life-safety, or any other critical purposes.

Common sense, and these Terms of Use, require that you independently verify the accuracy, completeness, and relevance of any information you get from Wolfram|Alpha before relying on it for any purpose in which things of value are at stake. We specifically disclaim all forms of liability for all results from Wolfram|Alpha.

In some fields definitive information can legally be provided only by certified and paid professionals. Examples include, among others, medical, legal, or financial advice, measures used in commerce, engineering calculations, and surveying or navigation data. These fields make use of many kinds of information and calculations, many of which are also available in Wolfram|Alpha. The availability of this kind of information in Wolfram|Alpha does not imply that Wolfram|Alpha purports to provide any official or certified information, or professional services of any kind.

Wolfram|Alpha is not a substitute for information or guidance provided by any licensed professional in any field, and if you need advice of this nature you should consult a professional who is licensed or knowledgeable in the appropriate area.

Although Wolfram|Alpha does not deliver in its results any user-supplied raw code executable in a browser or other execution environment, we cannot guarantee that a suitably constructed input could not cause the website to generate results pages that cause unintended or harmful operations on the client system. Wolfram|Alpha specifically disclaims any responsibility for harm to your system caused by use of the website.

The information provided by Wolfram|Alpha is provided “as is”, and for information purposes only. This means that Wolfram|Alpha does not offer any warranty whatsoever with regard to this service, its content, or any content or services accessible from the website. You agree that you are using the service at your own risk.

**In no event shall Wolfram|Alpha or its directors, officers, shareholders, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, or licensors be liable for any damages arising out of or related to the use, inability to use, performance, or nonperformance of this service. Some states or other jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations and exclusions may not apply to you.**

You agree to indemnify and hold Wolfram|Alpha and its directors, officers, shareholders, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, and licensors harmless from and against all losses, expenses, damages, and costs, including attorneys’ fees, resulting from your violation of these Terms of Use, including, without limitation, any use of this website other than as expressly authorized by these Terms of Use.
