Reddit Content Policy for Live Video and Audio
==============================================

The Reddit [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) applies to all content, including chats, on Reddit Live.

Additionally, any live video or audio content is also subject to the following:

**No NSFW Content**

Broadcasts on Reddit may not include NSFW (“Not Safe for Work”) content. [As noted](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy#text-content3) in the Content Policy, this means content that contains nudity, pornography or sexually suggestive content, or graphic violence, which a reasonable viewer may not want to be seen accessing in a public or formal setting such as a workplace.

**No Illegal or Dangerous Behavior**

Broadcasts may not contain activities that are illegal, or that pose unreasonable risk of bodily harm to the stream subject or bystanders. Please note that this includes (but is not limited to) broadcasting while operating a vehicle and the illegal use of substances.

**No Quarantine-Eligible Content**

Broadcasts on Reddit may not include content that would otherwise trigger a [Quarantine](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/quarantined-subreddits). As noted in the [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy), this means content that average redditors may find highly offensive or upsetting, or which promotes hoaxes.

**Contextual Exceptions**

When showing the world live as it happens, broadcasts may capture things that technically break these policies, but are nonetheless important. They may be newsworthy, educational, or otherwise socially valuable. Accordingly, we always take into account the context of a specific broadcast when making policy judgements.
