Community Guidelines
====================

At Snap, we contribute to human progress by empowering people to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world and have fun together. We've created these Community Guidelines to support our mission by encouraging the broadest range of self-expression while ensuring Snapchatters can use our services safely every day.

These Guidelines apply to all content on Snapchat. Media partners in Discover agree to additional guidelines, including the requirement that their content is properly fact-checked and accurate. In certain cases, we won’t take action against content when it is newsworthy and relates to a matter of political, social or other general concern to our community. 

Sexually explicit content
-------------------------

*   We prohibit accounts that promote or distribute pornographic content.
    
*   Breastfeeding and other depictions of nudity in non-sexual contexts are not considered pornographic and are permitted on Snapchat.
    
*   Never post, save or send nude or sexual content involving anyone under the age of 18 – even of yourself. Never ask a minor to send explicit imagery or chats. We report child sexual exploitation to the authorities.
    

Harassment & bullying
---------------------

*   We have zero tolerance for bullying or harassment of any kind. 
    
*   Don’t send a Snap with the intention of making someone feel bad. If someone blocks you, don’t try to contact them from another account.
    
*   Don’t take Snaps of people in private spaces – like a bathroom, changing room or hospital – without their knowledge and consent.
    
*   If someone is in your Snap and asks you to remove it, please do!
    
*   When playing a game, don’t harass other players or deliberately ruin the fun by playing in an unintended way.
    

Threats, violence & harm
------------------------

*   Never threaten to harm a person, a group of people or someone’s property. Encouraging violence is prohibited on Snapchat.
    
*   Don't post Snaps of gratuitous violence, including animal abuse.
    
*   We don’t allow the glorification of self-harm, including the promotion of self-injury or eating disorders.
    

Impersonation & spam
--------------------

*   Don’t pretend to be someone you’re not – this includes your friends, celebrities, brands or other organisations – or attempt to deceive people about who you are. 
    
*   We prohibit spam and deceptive practices, including content that imitates Snapchat advert formats.
    

Illegal content
---------------

*   Don’t use Snapchat for any illegal activities – including to buy or sell illegal drugs, contraband, counterfeit goods or illegal weapons.
    

Terrorism
---------

*   Terrorist organisations are prohibited from using our platform, and we have no tolerance for content that advocates or advances terrorism.
