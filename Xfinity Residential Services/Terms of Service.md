If you exceed your credit limit, we reserve the right to suspend Voice and require payment for usage charges assessed to your account. Our paper bills for Voice contain only a summary of charges. Detailed information is available for a limited period at a password-protected portion of our website. You may call 1-800-XFINITY for a paper copy of outbound toll call records related to your most recent bill. There may be an additional charge for these copies except where prohibited by applicable law.
            
    *   **c. Third-Party Charges That Are Your Responsibility.** You may incur charges with third-party service providers such as for accessing on-line services, calling parties who charge for their telephone-based services, purchasing or subscribing to other offerings via the Internet or interactive options on your TV Service that are separate and apart from the amounts charged by us. You are solely responsible for all such charges payable to third parties, including all applicable taxes.
        
    *   **d. Alternative Billing Arrangements.** We may agree to provide billing services on behalf of third parties. Any such third-party charges shall be payable pursuant to any contract or other arrangement between you and the third party. We will not be responsible for any dispute regarding these charges between you and such third party.

You agree that you may not amend or modify this Agreement with any restrictive endorsements (such as “paid in full”), or other statements or releases on or accompanying checks or other payments accepted by us and any such notations shall have no legal effect.
        
    *   **f. Our Remedies if You Pay Late or Fail to Pay.** ou may be billed fees, charges, and assessments related to late or non-payments if for any reason we do not receive payment for full amounts billed to you by the due date.

        2.  **Fees Not Considered Interest or Penalties:** We do not anticipate that you will fail to pay on a timely basis, and we do not extend credit to customers. Any fees, charges, and assessments due to late payment or nonpayment are liquidated damages intended to be a reasonable estimate of our costs resulting from late payments and non-payments. These costs will be difficult to calculate or to predict when we set such fees, charges, and assessments, because we cannot know in advance: (a) whether you will pay on a timely basis, if ever. (b) if you do pay late, when you will actually pay. and (c) what costs we will incur because of your late payment or non-payment.

    *   **g. Reconnection Fees and Related Charges.** If you resume Service(s) after any suspension as described, we may require you to pay additional installation or activation fees.

    *   **h. Our Right to Make Credit Inquiries. YOU AUTHORIZE US TO MAKE INQUIRIES AND TO RECEIVE INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR CREDIT EXPERIENCE FROM OTHERS, TO ENTER THIS INFORMATION IN YOUR FILE, AND TO DISCLOSE THIS INFORMATION TO APPROPRIATE THIRD PARTIES FOR REASONABLE BUSINESS PURPOSES.** We will not discriminate in the application of our credit inquiries and deposit policy on the basis of race, color, sex, creed, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, or marital status. Any risk assessments conducted by either us or by third party credit bureaus will be done in conformance with all applicable laws. We reserve the right to make credit inquiries even after having received a deposit from you with respect to our Services(s).
        
    *   **i. Your Responsibilities Concerning Billing Questions.** Subject to applicable law, if you intend to dispute a charge or request a billing credit, you must contact us within 120 days of the date on the bill or you waive any such disputes or credits.

3.  **REFUNDABLE DEPOSIT AND REFUNDS**
    
    We may require you to pay a refundable deposit when you activate the Service(s), if you add Xfinity Equipment and/or Service(s) or if you fail to pay any amounts when they are due. Subject to applicable law your deposit will be credited to your account (without interest unless otherwise required by law) the earlier to occur of: (1) your account remains in good standing for twelve (12) months or (2) upon full disconnection of all Services. Refunds shall be provided within thirty (30) days of Service disconnection and the return of all Xfinity Equipment or as otherwise specified by applicable law in an amount equal to the credit balance on your account, if any, minus any amounts due on your account (including without limitation, any amounts owed for the Service(s) or for any Xfinity Equipment that is damaged, altered, or not returned).

    *   **g. Arbitration Procedures.** This Arbitration Provision shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. Arbitrations shall be administered by the AAA pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) as modified by the version of this Arbitration Provision that is in effect when you notify us about your Dispute. You can obtain the AAA Rules from the AAA by visiting its website (www.adr.org) or calling its toll-free number (1-800-778-7879). If there is a conflict between this Arbitration Provision and the rest of this Agreement, this Arbitration Provision shall govern. If there is a conflict between this Arbitration Provision and the AAA rules, this Arbitration Provision shall govern. If the AAA will not administer a proceeding under this Arbitration Provision as written, the parties shall agree on a substitute arbitration organization. If the parties cannot agree, the parties shall mutually petition a court of appropriate jurisdiction to appoint an arbitration organization that will administer a proceeding under this Arbitration Provision as written applying the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules. A single arbitrator will resolve the Dispute. Unless you and we agree otherwise, any arbitration hearing will take place at a location convenient to you in the area where you receive Service(s) from us. If you no longer receive Service(s) from us when you notify us of your Dispute, then any arbitration hearing will take place at a location convenient to you in the county where you reside when you notify us of your Dispute provided that we offer Service(s) in that county, or in the area where you received Service(s) from us at the time of the events giving rise to your Dispute. The arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized by law and will take reasonable steps to protect customer account information and other confidential or proprietary information. The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision that explains the arbitrator’s essential findings and conclusions. The arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties only if necessary for purposes of enforcing the arbitrator’s award. An arbitrator’s award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court.
        
    *   **h. Waiver of Class Actions and Collective Relief.** THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY CLAIMS TO BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON A CLASS ACTION, JOINT OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS OR ON BASES INVOLVING CLAIMS BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC (SUCH AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL), OTHER SUBSCRIBERS, OR OTHER PERSONS. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT INDIVIDUAL PARTY’S CLAIM. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT AWARD RELIEF FOR OR AGAINST ANYONE WHO IS NOT A PARTY. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS AND COLLECTIVE RELIEF IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION AND CANNOT BE SEVERED FROM IT. THE REMAINING PORTIONS OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION ARE NOT ESSENTIAL PARTS OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION AND CAN BE SEVERED FROM IT BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION.
        
    *   **i. Arbitral Fees and Costs.** If your claim seeks more than $75,000 in the aggregate, the payment of the AAA’s fees and costs will be governed by the AAA rules. If your claims seek less than $75,000 in the aggregate, the payment of the AAA’s fees and costs will be our responsibility. However, if the arbitrator finds that your Dispute was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), the payment of the AAA’s fees and costs shall be governed by the AAA Rules and you shall reimburse us for all fees and costs that were your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. You may hire an attorney to represent you in arbitration. You are responsible for your attorneys’ fees and additional costs and may only recover your attorneys’ fees and costs in the arbitration to the extent that you could in court if the arbitration is decided in your favor. Notwithstanding anything in this Arbitration Provision to the contrary, we will pay all fees and costs that we are required by law to pay
        
    *   **j. Survival.** This Arbitration Provision shall survive the termination of your Service(s) with us.
