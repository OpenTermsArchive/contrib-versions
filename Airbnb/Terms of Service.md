Thank you for using Airbnb!

These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement ("**Agreement**") between you and Airbnb (as defined below) governing your access to and use of the Airbnb website, including any subdomains thereof, and any other websites through which Airbnb makes its services available (collectively, "**Site**"), our mobile, tablet and other smart device applications, and application program interfaces (collectively, "**Application**") and all associated services (collectively, "**Airbnb Services**"). The Site, Application and Airbnb Services together are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “**Airbnb Platform**”. Our [Host Guarantee Terms](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/terms/host_guarantee), [Guest Refund Policy](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/terms/guest_refund_policy), [Nondiscrimination Policy](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/terms/nondiscrimination_policy) and other [Policies](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/help/topic/250/terms---policies) applicable to your use of the Airbnb Platform are incorporated by reference into this Agreement.

When these Terms mention “**Airbnb**,” “**we**,” “**us**,” or “**our**,” it refers to Airbnb Ireland UC (“**Airbnb Ireland**”), The Watermarque Building, South Lotts Road, Ringsend, Dublin 4, Ireland. .

If you change your country of residence or establishment to a country outside of the EEA, the Airbnb company you contract with and the applicable Terms of Service will be determined by your new country of residence or establishment as specified in the Terms of Service for Non-European Users, from the date on which your country of residence or establishment changes.

Our collection and use of personal information in connection with your access to and use of the Airbnb Platform is described in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/terms/privacy_policy).

Any and all payment processing services through or in connection with your use of the Airbnb Platform ("**Payment Services**") are provided to you by one or more Airbnb Payments entities (individually and collectively, as appropriate, "**Airbnb Payments**") as set out in the [Payments Terms of Service](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/terms/payments_terms) ("**Payments Terms**").

Hosts alone are responsible for identifying, understanding, and complying with all laws, rules and regulations that apply to their Listings and Host Services (as defined below). For example, some cities have laws that restrict their ability to host paying guests for short periods or provide certain Host Services. In many cities, Hosts may have to register, get a permit or obtain a license before providing certain Host Services (such as preparing food, serving alcohol for sale, guiding tours or operating a vehicle). Host are alone responsible for identifying and obtaining any required licenses, permits, or registrations for any Host Services they offer. Certain types of Host Services may be prohibited altogether. Penalties may include fines or other enforcement. We provide some information in our [Help Center](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/help/topic/896/responsible-hosting) to help you identify some of the obligations that apply to you. If you have questions about how local laws apply to your Listing(s) and Host Service(s) on Airbnb, you should always seek legal guidance.

#### 1\. Scope of Airbnb Services

1.1 The Airbnb Platform is an online marketplace that enables registered users (“**Members**”) and certain third parties who offer services (Members and third parties who offer services are “**Hosts**” and the services they offer are “**Host Services**”) to publish such Host Services on the Airbnb Platform (“**Listings**”) and to communicate and transact directly with Members that are seeking to book such Host Services (Members using Host Services are “**Guests**”). Host Services may include the offering of vacation or other properties for use ("**Accommodations**"), single or multi-day activities in various categories (“**Experiences**”), access to unique events and locations (“**Events**”), and a variety of other travel and non-travel related services.

1.2 As the provider of the Airbnb Platform, Airbnb does not own, create, sell, resell, provide, control, manage, offer, deliver, or supply any Listings or Host Services, nor is Airbnb an organiser or retailer of travel packages under Directive (EU) 2015/2302. Hosts alone are responsible for their Listings and Host Services. When Members make or accept a booking, they are entering into a contract directly with each other. Airbnb is not and does not become a party to or other participant in any contractual relationship between Members, nor is Airbnb a real estate broker or insurer. Airbnb is not acting as an agent in any capacity for any Member, except as specified in the [Payments Terms](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/terms/payments_terms).

1.3 While we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes, Airbnb has no control over and does not guarantee (i) the existence, quality, safety, suitability, or legality of any Listings or Host Services, (ii) the truth or accuracy of any Listing descriptions, Ratings, Reviews, or other Member Content (as defined below), or (iii) the performance or conduct of any Member or third party. Airbnb does not endorse any Member, Listing or Host Services. Any references to a Member being "[verified](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/help/article/336/what-are-profile-verifications-and-how-do-i-get-them)" (or similar language) only indicate that the Member has completed a relevant verification or identification process and nothing else. Any such description is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by Airbnb about any Member, including of the Member's identity or background or whether the Member is trustworthy, safe or suitable. You should always exercise due diligence and care when deciding whether to stay in an Accommodation, participate in an Experience or Event or use other Host Services, accept a booking request from a Guest, or communicate and interact with other Members, whether online or in person. Verified Images (as defined below) are intended only to indicate a photographic representation of a Listing at the time the photograph was taken, and are therefore not an endorsement by Airbnb of any Host or Listing.

1.4 If you choose to use the Airbnb Platform as a Host or Co-Host (as defined below), your relationship with Airbnb is limited to being an independent, third-party contractor, and not an employee, agent, joint venturer or partner of Airbnb for any reason, and you act exclusively on your own behalf and for your own benefit, and not on behalf, or for the benefit, of Airbnb. Airbnb does not, and shall not be deemed to, direct or control you generally or in your performance under these Terms specifically, including in connection with your provision of the Host Services. You acknowledge that you have complete discretion whether to list Host Services or otherwise engage in other business or employment activities.

1.5 To promote the Airbnb Platform and to increase the exposure of Listings to potential Guests, Listings and other Member Content may be displayed on other websites, in applications, within emails, and in online and offline advertisements in accordance with Section 5. To assist Members who speak different languages, Airbnb may make automated tools available to enable Members to translate Listings and other Member Content, in whole or in part, into other languages. Members are free to use these tools at their own discretion. Airbnb cannot guarantee the accuracy or quality of such translations and Members are responsible for reviewing and verifying the accuracy of such translations.

1.6 The Airbnb Platform may contain links to third-party websites or resources (“**Third-Party Services**”). Such Third-Party Services may be subject to different terms and conditions and privacy practices. Airbnb is not responsible or liable for the availability or accuracy of such Third-Party Services, or the content, products, or services available from such Third-Party Services. Links to such Third-Party Services are not an endorsement by Airbnb of such Third-Party Services.

1.7 Airbnb is not responsible for outages or disruptions of the Internet and telecommunications infrastructure which are beyond our control and can lead to interruptions in the availability of the Airbnb Platform. Airbnb may, temporarily and under consideration of the Members’ legitimate interests (e.g. by providing prior notice), restrict the availability of the Airbnb Platform or certain areas or features thereof, if this is necessary in view of capacity limits, the security or integrity of our servers, or to carry out maintenance measures that ensure the proper or improved functioning of the Airbnb Platform. Section 17 (Liability) remains unaffected. Airbnb may improve, enhance and modify the Airbnb Platform and introduce new Airbnb Services from time to time. Airbnb will provide notice to Members of any changes to the Airbnb Platform, unless such changes are of minor nature without having a material effect on the parties’ contractual obligations.

#### 2\. Eligibility, Using the Airbnb Platform, Member Verification

2.1 In order to access and use the Airbnb Platform or register an Airbnb Account you must be an individual at least 18 years old or a duly organized, validly existing business, organization or other legal entity in good standing under the laws of the country you are registered and able to enter into legally binding contracts.

2.2 You will comply with any applicable export control laws in your local jurisdiction. You also represent and warrant that (i) neither you nor your Host Service(s) are located or take place in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a "terrorist supporting" country, and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.

2.3 Airbnb may make access to and use of the Airbnb Platform, or certain areas or features of the Airbnb Platform, subject to certain conditions or requirements, such as completing a verification process, meeting specific quality or eligibility criteria, meeting Ratings or Reviews thresholds, or a Member’s booking and cancellation history.

2.4 User verification on the Internet is difficult and we do not assume any responsibility for the confirmation of any Member’s identity. Notwithstanding the above, for transparency and fraud prevention purposes, and as permitted by applicable laws, we may, but have no obligation to (i) ask Members to provide a form of government identification or other information or undertake additional checks designed to help verify the identities or backgrounds of Members, (ii) screen Members against third party databases or other sources and request reports from service providers, and (iii) where we have sufficient information to identify a Member, obtain reports from public records of criminal convictions or sex offender registrations or an equivalent version of background or registered sex offender checks in your local jurisdiction (if available).

2.5 The access to or use of certain areas and features of the Airbnb Platform may be subject to separate policies, standards or guidelines, or may require that you accept additional terms and conditions,before you can access the relevant areas or features of the Airbnb Platform. If there is a conflict between these Terms and terms and conditions applicable to a specific area or feature of the Airbnb Platform, the latter terms and conditions will take precedence with respect to your access to or use of that area or feature, unless specified otherwise in the latter terms and conditions.

2.6 If you access or download the Application from the Apple App Store, you agree to [Apple’s Licensed Application End User License Agreement](http://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/appstore/dev/stdeula/). Some areas of the Airbnb Platform implement Google Maps/Earth mapping services, including Google Maps API(s). Your use of Google Maps/Earth is subject to the [Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service](https://www.google.com/help/terms_maps.html).

#### 3\. Modification of these Terms

Airbnb reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time in accordance with this provision. If we make changes to these Terms, we will post the revised Terms on the Airbnb Platform and update the “Last Updated” date at the top of these Terms. We will also provide you with notice of the modifications by email at least thirty (30) days before the date they become effective. If you disagree with the revised Terms, you may terminate this Agreement with immediate effect. We will inform you about your right to terminate the Agreement in the notification email. If you do not terminate your Agreement before the date the revised Terms become effective, your continued access to or use of the Airbnb Platform will constitute acceptance of the revised Terms.

#### 4\. Account Registration

4.1 You must register an account ("**Airbnb Account**") to access and use certain features of the Airbnb Platform, such as publishing or booking a Listing. If you are registering an Airbnb Account for a business, organization or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to legally bind that entity and grant us all permissions and licenses provided in these Terms.

4.2 You can register an Airbnb Account using an email address and creating a password, or through your account with certain third-party social networking services, such as Facebook or Google ("**SNS Account**"). You have the ability to disable the connection between your Airbnb Account and your SNS Account at any time, by accessing the "Settings" section of the Airbnb Platform.

4.3 You must provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and keep your Airbnb Account and public Airbnb Account profile page information up-to-date at all times.

4.4 You may not register more than one (1) Airbnb Account unless Airbnb authorizes you to do so. You may not assign or otherwise transfer your Airbnb Account to another party.

4.5 You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your Airbnb Account credentials and may not disclose your credentials to any third party. You must immediately notify Airbnb if you know or have any reason to suspect that your credentials have been lost, stolen, misappropriated, or otherwise compromised or in case of any actual or suspected unauthorized use of your Airbnb Account. You are liable for any and all activities conducted through your Airbnb Account, unless such activities are not authorized by you and you are not otherwise negligent (such as failing to report the unauthorized use or loss of your credentials).

4.6 Airbnb may enable features that allow you to authorize other Members or certain third parties to take certain actions that affect your Airbnb Account. For example, we may enable Members to link their Airbnb Accounts to businesses and take actions for those businesses, we may enable eligible Members or certain third parties to book Listings on behalf of other Members, or we may enable Hosts to add other Members as Co-Hosts (as defined below) to help manage their Listings. These features do not require that you share your credentials with any other person. No third party is authorized by Airbnb to ask for your credentials, and you shall not request the credentials of another Member.

#### 5\. Content

5.1 Airbnb may enable Members to (i) create, upload, post, send, receive and store content, such as text, photos, audio, video, or other materials and information on or through the Airbnb Platform ("**Member Content**"); and (ii) access and view Member Content and any content that Airbnb itself makes available on or through the Airbnb Platform, including proprietary Airbnb content and any content licensed or authorized for use by or through Airbnb from a third party ("**Airbnb Content**" and together with Member Content, "**Collective Content**").

5.2 The Airbnb Platform, Airbnb Content, and Member Content may in its entirety or in part be protected by copyright, trademark, and/or other laws of the United States and other countries. You acknowledge and agree that the Airbnb Platform and Airbnb Content, including all associated intellectual property rights, are the exclusive property of Airbnb and/or its licensors or authorizing third-parties. You will not remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Airbnb Platform, Airbnb Content or Member Content. All trademarks, service marks, logos, trade names, and any other source identifiers of Airbnb used on or in connection with the Airbnb Platform and Airbnb Content are trademarks or registered trademarks of Airbnb in the United States and abroad. Trademarks, service marks, logos, trade names and any other proprietary designations of third parties used on or in connection with the Airbnb Platform, Airbnb Content, and/or Collective Content are used for identification purposes only and may be the property of their respective owners.

5.3 You will not use, copy, adapt, modify, prepare derivative works of, distribute, license, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, broadcast or otherwise exploit the Airbnb Platform or Collective Content, except to the extent you are the legal owner of certain Member Content or as expressly permitted in these Terms. No licenses or rights are granted to you by implication or otherwise under any intellectual property rights owned or controlled by Airbnb or its licensors, except for the licenses and rights expressly granted in these Terms.

5.4 Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Airbnb grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, revocable, non-transferable license to (i) download and use the Application on your personal device(s); and (ii) access and view any Collective Content made available on or through the Airbnb Platform and accessible to you, solely for your personal and non-commercial use.

5.5 By uploading, posting or otherwise making available any Member Content on or through the Airbnb Platform, you grant to Airbnb, as you create, publish or make it available, a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sub-licensable and transferable license to such Member Content, for the term of the protection of the rights so licensed, to access, use, store, copy, modify, prepare derivative works of, distribute, publish, transmit, stream, broadcast, and otherwise exploit in any manner such Member Content to provide and/or promote the Airbnb Platform, in any media or platform, known or unknown to date and in particular on Internet and social networks. Insofar as Member Content (including Verified Images) includes personal information, such Member Content will only be used for these purposes if such use complies with applicable data protection laws in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/terms/privacy_policy). Unless you provide specific consent, Airbnb does not claim any ownership rights in any Member Content and nothing in these Terms will be deemed to restrict any rights that you may have to use or exploit your Member Content.

5.6 Airbnb may offer Hosts the option of having professional photographers take photographs of their Host Services, which are made available by the photographer to Hosts to include in their Listings with or without a watermark or tag bearing the words "Airbnb.com Verified Photo" or similar wording ("**Verified Images**"). You are responsible for ensuring that your Host Service is accurately represented in the Verified Images and you will stop using the Verified Images on or through the Airbnb Platform if they no longer accurately represent your Listing, if you stop hosting the Host Service featured, or if your Airbnb Account is terminated or suspended for any reason. You acknowledge that you hold no ownership right whatsoever in the intellectual property related to any Verified Images. You acknowledge and agree that Airbnb shall have the right to use any Verified Images in accordance with Section 5.5 including to provide and promote the Platform. Airbnb in turn grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, revocable, non-transferable license to use Verified Images outside of the Airbnb Platform solely for your personal and non-commercial use.

5.7 You are solely responsible for all Member Content that you make available on or through the Airbnb Platform. Accordingly, you represent and warrant that: (i) you either are the sole and exclusive owner of all Member Content that you make available on or through the Airbnb Platform or you have all rights, licenses, consents and releases that are necessary to grant to Airbnb the rights in and to such Member Content, as contemplated under these Terms; and (ii) neither the Member Content nor your posting, uploading, publication, submission or transmittal of the Member Content or Airbnb's use of the Member Content (or any portion thereof) as contemplated under these Terms will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party's patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, moral rights or other proprietary or intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.

5.8 You will not post, upload, publish, submit or transmit any Member Content that: (i) is fraudulent, false, misleading (directly or by omission or failure to update information) or deceptive; (ii) is defamatory, libelous, obscene, pornographic, vulgar or offensive; (iii) promotes discrimination, bigotry, racism, hatred, harassment or harm against any individual or group; (iv) is violent or threatening or promotes violence or actions that are threatening to any other person or animal; (v) promotes illegal or harmful activities or substances; or (vi) violates Airbnb’s [Content Policy](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/help/article/546/what-is-airbnb-s-content-policy) or any other Airbnb policy. Airbnb may remove or disable access to any Member Content that is in violation of applicable law, these Terms or Airbnb’s then-current [Policies](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/help/policies) or [Standards](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/standards), or otherwise may be harmful or objectionable to Airbnb, its Members, third parties, or property. Where Airbnb removes or disables Member Content, Airbnb will notify a Member and provide the reasons for such a measure, unless such notification would (i) prevent or impede the detection or prevention of fraud or other illegal activities, (ii) harm the legitimate interests of other Members or third parties, or (ii) contravene applicable laws. You may appeal such a decision by contacting [customer service](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/help/contact_us).

5.9 Airbnb respects copyright law and expects its Members to do the same. If you believe that any content on the Airbnb Platform infringes copyrights you own, please notify us in accordance with our [Copyright Policy](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/terms/copyright_policy).

#### 6\. Service Fees

6.1 Airbnb may charge fees to Hosts ("**Host Fees**") and/or Guests ("**Guest Fees**") (collectively, "**Service Fees**") in consideration for the use of the Airbnb Platform. More information about when Service Fees apply and how they are calculated can be found on our [Service Fees page](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/help/article/1857/what-are-airbnb-service-fees).

6.2 Any applicable Service Fees (including any applicable Taxes) will be displayed to a Host or Guest prior to publishing or booking a Listing. Airbnb reserves the right to change the Service Fees at any time, and will provide Members adequate notice of any fee changes before they become effective. Such fee changes will not affect any bookings made prior to the effective date of the fee change.

6.3 You are responsible for paying any Service Fees that you owe to Airbnb. The applicable Service Fees (including any applicable Taxes) are collected by Airbnb Payments. Airbnb Payments will deduct any Host Fees from the Listing Fee before remitting the payout to the Host. Any Guest Fees are included in the Total Fees collected by Airbnb Payments. Except as otherwise provided on the Airbnb Platform, Service Fees are non-refundable.

#### 7\. Terms specific for Hosts

##### 7.1 Terms applicable to all Listings

7.1.1 When creating a Listing through the Airbnb Platform you must (i) provide complete and accurate information about your Host Service (such as listing description, location, and calendar availability), (ii) disclose any deficiencies, restrictions (such as house rules) and requirements that apply (such as any minimum age, proficiency or fitness requirements for an Experience) and (iii) provide any other pertinent information requested by Airbnb. You are responsible for keeping your Listing information (including calendar availability) up-to-date at all times.

7.1.2 You are solely responsible for setting a price (including any Taxes if applicable, or charges such as cleaning fees) for your Listing (“**Listing Fee**”). Once a Guest requests a booking of your Listing, you may not request that the Guest pays a higher price than in the booking request.

7.1.3 Any terms and conditions included in your Listing, in particular in relation to cancellations, must not conflict with these Terms or the relevant cancellation policy for your Listing.

7.1.4 Airbnb may enable certain Hosts to participate in its “**Open Homes Program**.” The Open Homes Program enables Hosts to provide Listings to certain Guests, such as refugees or evacuees, for free. You acknowledge that if you choose to participate in the Open Homes Program, your ability to restrict your Listing to certain Guests, such as Guests with previous positive Reviews, may be limited.

7.1.5 Pictures, animations or videos (collectively, "**Images**") used in your Listings must accurately reflect the quality and condition of your Host Services. Airbnb reserves the right to require that Listings have a minimum number of Images of a certain format, size and resolution.

7.1.6 The placement and ranking of Listings in search results on the Airbnb Platform may vary and depend on a variety of factors, such as Guest search parameters and preferences, Host requirements, price and calendar availability, number and quality of Images, customer service and cancellation history, Reviews and Ratings, type of Host Service, and/or ease of booking. More information about the factors that determine how your Listing appears in search results can be found on our [help center](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/help/article/39/what-factors-determine-how-my-listing-appears-in-search-results).

7.1.7 When you accept or have pre-approved a booking request by a Guest, you are entering into a legally binding agreement with the Guest and are required to provide your Host Service(s) to the Guest as described in your Listing when the booking request is made. You also agree to pay the applicable Host Fee and any applicable Taxes.

7.1.8 Airbnb recommends that Hosts obtain appropriate insurance for their Host Services. Please review any respective insurance policy carefully, and in particular make sure that you are familiar with and understand any exclusions to, and any deductibles that may apply for, such insurance policy, including, but not limited to, whether or not your insurance policy will cover the actions or inactions of Guests (and the individuals the Guest has booked for, if applicable) while staying at your Accommodation or participating in your Experience, Event or other Host Service.

##### 7.2 Listing Accommodations

7.2.1 Unless expressly allowed by Airbnb, you may not list more than one Accommodation per Listing.

7.2.2 If you choose to require a security deposit for your Accommodation, you must specify this in your Listing ("**Security Deposit**"). Hosts are not allowed to ask for a Security Deposit (i) after a booking has been confirmed or (ii) outside of the Airbnb Platform.

7.2.3 Any Listing you post and the booking of, or a Guest's stay at, an Accommodation shall (i) not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties, such as homeowners association, condominium, or other agreements, and (ii) comply with all applicable laws (such as zoning laws), Tax requirements, and other rules and regulations (including having all required permits, licenses and registrations).

##### 7.3 Listing Experiences, Events and other Host Services

Hosts who list Experiences, Events and Host Services other than Accommodations agree to and are subject to the [Additional Terms for Experience Hosts](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/experiences/terms-of-service).

##### 7.4 Co-Hosts

7.4.1 Airbnb may enable Hosts to authorize other Members (“**Co-Hosts**”) to administer the Host’s Listing(s), and to bind the Host and take certain actions in relation to the Listing(s) as permitted by the Host, such as accepting booking requests, messaging and welcoming Guests, and updating the Listing Fee and calendar availability (collectively, “**Co-Host Services**”). Any agreement formed between Host and Co-Host may not conflict with these Terms, the [Payments Terms](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/terms/payments_terms), or any other [Policies](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/help/topic/250/terms---policies)applicable to your Host Service(s). Co-Hosts may only act in an individual capacity and not on behalf of a company or other organization, unless expressly authorized by Airbnb. Airbnb reserves the right, in our sole discretion, to limit the number of Co-Hosts a Host may invite for each Listing and to limit the number of Listings a Co-Host may manage.

7.4.2 Hosts should exercise due diligence and care when deciding who to add as a Co-Host to their Listing(s). Hosts are responsible and liable for any and all Listings and Member Content published on the Airbnb Platform created by a Co-Host on their behalf. Further, Hosts remain responsible and liable for their own acts and omissions, including, but not limited to, conduct that causes harm or damage to the Co-Host(s). Co-Hosts remain responsible and liable for their own acts and omissions when engaging in their roles and responsibilities as a Co-Host, including, but not limited to, conduct that causes harm or damage to the Host. In addition, both Host and Co-Host are jointly responsible and severally liable for third party claims, including Guest claims, arising from the acts and omissions of the other person as related to hosting activities, communications with Guests, and the provision of any Co-Host Services.

7.4.3 Unless agreed otherwise by Host and Co-Host, Host and Co-Host may terminate the Co-Host agreement at any time. In addition, both Host and Co-Host acknowledge that their Co-hosting relationship will terminate in the event that Airbnb (i) terminates the Co-Host service or (ii) terminates either party’s participation in the Co-Host service. When the Co-Host agreement is terminated, the Host will remain responsible for all of the Co-Host’s actions prior to the termination, including the responsibility to fulfill any pending or future bookings initiated prior to the termination, except in the event of gross misconduct or malicious behavior of the Co-Host. When a Member is removed as a Co-Host, that Member will no longer have access to any Host or Guest information related to the applicable Host’s Listing(s).

7.4.4 As a Co-Host, you will not be reviewed by Guests, meaning that your Co-Host activities will not affect your Reviews or Ratings for other Listings for which you are a Host. Instead, the Host of such Listing(s) will be reviewed by Guests (including potentially on the basis of the Co-Host’s conduct and performance). Hosts acknowledge that Reviews and Ratings from Guests for their Listing(s) may be impacted by a Co-Host’s conduct and performance.

#### 8\. Terms specific for Guests

##### 8.1 Terms applicable to all bookings

8.1.1 Subject to meeting any requirements (such as completing any verification processes) set by Airbnb and/or the Host, you can book a Listing available on the Airbnb Platform by following the respective booking process. All applicable fees, including the Listing Fee, Security Deposit (if applicable), Guest Fee and any applicable Taxes (collectively, “**Total Fees**”) will be presented to you prior to booking a Listing. You agree to pay the Total Fees for any booking requested in connection with your Airbnb Account.

8.1.2 Upon receipt of a booking confirmation from Airbnb, a legally binding agreement is formed between you and your Host, subject to any additional terms and conditions of the Host that apply, including in particular the applicable cancellation policy and any rules and restrictions specified in the Listing. Airbnb Payments will collect the Total Fees at the time of the booking request or upon the Host’s confirmation pursuant to the [Payments Terms](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/terms/payments_terms). For certain bookings, Guests may be required to pay or have the option to pay in multiple installments.

8.1.3 If you book a Host Service on behalf of additional guests, you are required to ensure that every additional guest meets any requirements set by the Host, and is made aware of and agrees to these Terms and any terms and conditions, rules and restrictions set by the Host. If you are booking for an additional guest who is a minor, you represent and warrant that you are legally authorized to act on behalf of the minor. Minors may only participate in an Experience, Event or other Host Service if accompanied by an adult who is responsible for them.

8.1.4 Airbnb may enable a Guest who is booking a Listing on behalf of one or more additional guests (the “**Organizer**”) to split the payment of the Total Fees for an eligible booking on a pro-rata basis between the Organizer and at least one other additional guest (each a “**Co-Payer**”) (the “**Group Payment Service**”). In order to participate in the Group Payment Service, each Co-Payer must have or register an Airbnb Account prior to making a payment. All payments via the Group Payment Service are handled by Airbnb Payments and are subject to the [Group Payment Terms of Service](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/help/article/1928/airbnb-group-payments-terms-of-service).

##### 8.2 Booking Accommodations

8.2.1 You understand that a confirmed booking of an Accommodation (“**Accommodation Booking**”) is a limited license granted to you by the Host to enter, occupy and use the Accommodation for the duration of your stay, during which time the Host (only where and to the extent permitted by applicable law) retains the right to re-enter the Accommodation, in accordance with your agreement with the Host.

8.2.2 You agree to leave the Accommodation no later than the checkout time that the Host specifies in the Listing or such other time as mutually agreed upon between you and the Host. If you stay past the agreed upon checkout time without the Host's consent (“**Overstay**”), you no longer have a license to stay in the Accommodation and the Host is entitled to make you leave in a manner consistent with applicable law.

##### 8.3 Booking Experiences, Events and other Host Services

8.3.1 You should carefully review the description of any Experience, Event or other Host Service you intend to book to ensure you (and any additional guests you are booking for) meet any minimum age, proficiency, fitness or other requirements which the Host has specified in their Listing. At your sole discretion you may want to inform the Host of any medical or physical conditions, or other circumstances that may impact your and any additional guest’s ability to participate in any Experience, Event or other Host Service. In addition, certain laws, like the minimum legal drinking age in the location of the Experience, Event or other Host Service, may also apply.

8.3.2 Before and during an Experience, Event or other Host Service you must at all times adhere to the Hosts’ instructions.

8.3.3 You may not bring any additional individuals to an Experience, Event or other Host Service unless such an individual was added by you as an additional guest during the booking process on the Airbnb Platform.

**8.4 Airbnb Travel Credits**

Airbnb Travel Credits may be redeemed for eligible bookings via the Airbnb Platform as specified in the terms and conditions provided with the Travel Credit. You may only redeem Airbnb Travel Credits after the Airbnb Travel Credits are reflected in your Airbnb Account.

#### 9\. Booking Modifications, Cancellations and Refunds, Resolution Center

9.1 Hosts and Guests are responsible for any modifications to a booking that they make via the Airbnb Platform or direct Airbnb customer service to make ("**Booking Modifications**"), and agree to pay any additional Listing Fees, Host Fees or Guest Fees and/or Taxes associated with such Booking Modifications.

9.2 Guests can cancel a confirmed booking at any time pursuant to the Listing’s [cancellation policy](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/home/cancellation_policies) set by the Host, and Airbnb Payments will refund the amount of the Total Fees due to the Guest in accordance with such cancellation policy. Unless [extenuating circumstances](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/help/article/1320/what-is-airbnb-s-extenuating-circumstances-policy) exist, any portion of the Total Fees due to the Host under the applicable cancellation policy will be remitted to the Host by Airbnb Payments pursuant to the [Payments Terms](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/terms/payments_terms).

9.3 If a Host cancels a confirmed booking, the Guest will receive a full refund of the Total Fees for such booking. In some instances, Airbnb may allow the Guest to apply the refund to a new booking, in which case Airbnb Payments will credit the amount against the Guest’s subsequent booking at the Guest’s direction. Further, Airbnb may publish an automated review on the Listing cancelled by the Host indicating that a booking was cancelled. In addition, Airbnb may (i) keep the calendar for the Listing unavailable or blocked for the dates of the cancelled booking, and/or (ii) impose a [cancellation fee](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/help/article/990/im-a-host-what-penalties-apply-if-i-need-to-cancel-a-reservation), unless the Host has a valid reason for cancelling the booking pursuant to [Airbnb’s Extenuating Circumstances Policy](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/help/article/1320/what-is-airbnb-s-extenuating-circumstances-policy) or has legitimate concerns about the Guest’s behavior.

9.4 For Experiences, Events and other Host Services, if weather poses a safety risk to Guests, or if it prevents a Host from carrying out a Host Service that takes place primarily outdoors, Hosts may cancel the Host Service. Hosts may also cancel the Host Service if other conditions exist that would prevent the Host from offering the Host Service safely.

9.5 In certain circumstances, Airbnb may cancel a pending or confirmed booking on behalf of a Host or Guest and initiate corresponding refunds and payouts. This may be for reasons set forth in [Airbnb's Extenuating Circumstances Policy](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/help/article/1320/what-is-airbnb-s-extenuating-circumstances-policy) or for the reasons set out in Section 15 of these Terms. Where Airbnb cancels a booking, Airbnb will, notify Members and provide the reasons for such a measure, unless such notification would (i) prevent or impede the detection or prevention of fraud or other illegal activities, (ii) harm the legitimate interests of other Members or third parties, or (iii) contravene applicable laws. You may appeal a cancellation by contacting [customer service](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/help/contact_us).

9.6 If a Guest who books an Accommodation suffers a Travel Issue as defined in the [Guest Refund Policy](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/terms/guest_refund_policy), Airbnb may determine to refund the Guest part or all of the Total Fees in accordance with the Guest Refund Policy. If a Guest who books an Experience, Event or other Host Service suffers a Travel Issue as defined in the [Experiences Guest Refund Policy](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/help/article/2278/experiences-guest-refund-policy), Airbnb may determine, in its sole discretion, to refund the Guest part or all of the Total Fees in accordance with the Experiences Guest Refund Policy.

9.7 If a Guest or Airbnb cancels a confirmed booking, and the Guest receives a refund in accordance with the [Guest Refund Policy](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/terms/guest_refund_policy), [Experiences Guest Refund Policy](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/help/article/2278/experiences-guest-refund-policy), [Extenuating Circumstances Policy](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/help/article/1320/what-is-airbnb-s-extenuating-circumstances-policy), or the applicable cancellation policy set by the Host and mentioned in the Listing, after the Host has already been paid, Airbnb Payments will be entitled to recover the amount of any such refund from the Host, including by subtracting such refund amount out from any future Payouts due to the Host.

9.8 Except as otherwise set out in these Terms, Members may use the Resolution Center to send or request money for refunds, additional Host Services, Co-Host Services or Damage Claims related to bookings. You agree to pay all amounts sent through the Resolution Center in connection with your Airbnb Account, and Airbnb Payments will handle all such payments.

#### 10\. Ratings and Reviews

10.1 Within a certain timeframe after completing a booking, Guests and Hosts can leave a public review (“**Review**”) and submit a star rating (“**Rating**”) about each other. Ratings or Reviews reflect the opinions of individual Members and do not reflect the opinion of Airbnb. Ratings and Reviews are not verified by Airbnb for accuracy and may be incorrect or misleading.

10.2 Ratings and Reviews by Guests and Hosts must be accurate and may not contain any offensive or defamatory language. Ratings and Reviews are subject to Section 5 and must comply with Airbnb’s [Content Policy](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/help/article/546/what-is-airbnb-s-content-policy) and [Extortion Policy](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/help/article/548/what-is-airbnb-s-extortion-policy).

10.3 Members are prohibited from manipulating the Ratings and Reviews system in any manner, such as instructing a third party to write a positive or negative Review about another Member.

10.4 Ratings and Reviews are part of a Member’s public profile and may also be surfaced elsewhere on the Airbnb Platform (such as the Listing page) together with other relevant information such as number of bookings, number of cancellations, average response time and other information.

#### 11\. Damage to Accommodations, Disputes between Members

11.1 As a Guest, you are responsible for leaving the Accommodation (including any personal or other property located at the Accommodation) in the condition it was in when you arrived. You are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals whom you invite to, or otherwise provide access to, the Accommodation, excluding the Host (and the individuals the Host invites to the Accommodation, if applicable).

11.2 If a Host claims and provides evidence that you as a Guest have culpably damaged an Accommodation or any personal or other property at an Accommodation ("**Damage Claim**"), the Host can seek payment from you through the Resolution Center. If a Host escalates a Damage Claim to Airbnb, you will be given an opportunity to respond. If you agree to pay the Host, or Airbnb determines under consideration of any applicable statutory rules on the burden of proof that you are responsible for the Damage Claim, Airbnb via Airbnb Payments will, after the end of your stay, collect any such sums from you and/or against the Security Deposit (if applicable) required to cover the Damage Claim pursuant to the [Payments Terms](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/terms/payments_terms). Airbnb also reserves the right to otherwise collect payment from you and pursue any remedies available to Airbnb in this regard in situations in which you are responsible for a Damage Claim, including, but not limited to, in relation to any payment requests made by Hosts under the [Airbnb Host Guarantee](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/guarantee). You may appeal a decision taken by Airbnb on the basis of this Section 11.2 by contacting [customer support](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/help/contact_us). Any decisions made by Airbnb in relation to a Damage Claim do not affect your contractual or statutory rights. Your right to take legal action before a court of law remains unaffected.

11.3 Members agree to cooperate with and assist Airbnb in good faith, and to provide Airbnb with such information and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by Airbnb, in connection with any Damage Claims or other complaints or claims made by Members relating to (i) Accommodations or any personal or other property located at an Accommodation (including, without limitation, payment requests made under the Airbnb Host Guarantee), (ii) Experiences, (iii) Co-Host agreements, or (iv) a Group Payment Booking. A Member shall, upon Airbnb's reasonable request and at no cost to the Member, participate in mediation or a similar resolution process with another Member, which process will be conducted by Airbnb or a third party selected by Airbnb or its insurer, with respect to losses for which a Member is requesting payment from Airbnb (including but not limited to payments under the Airbnb Host Guarantee). Members are entitled to terminate their participation in the mediation or similar resolution process at any time. A Member’s right to take legal action before a court of law remains unaffected.

#### 12\. Rounding off

Airbnb generally supports payment amounts that are payable from or to Guests or Hosts to the smallest unit supported by a given currency (i.e., U.S. cents, Euro cents or other supported currencies). Where Airbnb’s third-party payment services provider does not support payments in the smaller unit supported by a given currency, Airbnb may, in its sole discretion, round up or round down the displayed amounts that are payable from or to Guests or Hosts to the nearest whole functional base unit in which the currency is denominated (i.e. to the nearest dollar, Euro or other supported currency); for example, Airbnb may round up an amount of $101.50 to $102.00, and round down an amount of $101.49 to $101.00.

#### 13\. Taxes

13.1 As a Host you are solely responsible for determining your obligations to report, collect, remit or include in your Listing Fees any applicable VAT or other indirect sales taxes, occupancy tax, tourist or other visitor taxes or income taxes ("**Taxes**").

13.2 Tax regulations may require us to collect appropriate Tax information from Hosts, or to withhold Taxes from payouts to Hosts, or both. If a Host fails to provide us with the required documentation under applicable law (e.g. a tax number) to alleviate our obligation (if any) to withhold Taxes from payouts to you, we reserve the right to withhold payouts up to the tax-relevant amount as required by law until resolution.

13.3 You understand that any appropriate governmental agency, department and/or authority ("**Tax Authority**") where your Accommodation is located may require Taxes to be collected from Guests or Hosts on Listing Fees, and to be remitted to the respective Tax Authority. The laws in jurisdictions may vary, but these Taxes may be required to be collected and remitted as a percentage of the Listing Fees set by Hosts, a set amount per day, or other variations, and are sometimes called "transient occupancy taxes," "hotel taxes," "lodging taxes," "city taxes," "room taxes" or "tourist taxes" ("**Occupancy Taxes**").

13.4 In certain jurisdictions, Airbnb may decide in its sole discretion to facilitate collection and remittance of Occupancy Taxes from or on behalf of Guests or Hosts, in accordance with these Terms ("**Collection and Remittance**") if such jurisdiction asserts Airbnb or Hosts have an Occupancy Tax collection and remittance obligation. In any jurisdiction in which we decide to facilitate direct Collection and Remittance, you hereby instruct and authorize Airbnb (via Airbnb Payments) to collect Occupancy Taxes from Guests on the Host's behalf at the time Listing Fees are collected, and to remit such Occupancy Taxes to the Tax Authority. In other jurisdictions Airbnb may decide in its sole discretion to collect Occupancy Taxes and remit such Taxes to eligible and qualifying Hosts, based on tax information supplied by the Host, for ultimate reporting and remittance by such Host to the Tax Authority (“**Pass-Through Tax Feature**”). Such Hosts using the Pass-Through Tax Feature will be solely responsible for informing Airbnb about the correct Occupancy Tax amount to be collected from the Guest in accordance with applicable law and directly remitting the Occupancy Taxes to the relevant Tax Authority. Airbnb does not assume any liability for the failure of a participating Host to comply with any applicable tax reporting or remittance obligations.The amount of Occupancy Taxes, if any, collected and remitted by Airbnb will be visible to and separately stated to both Guests and Hosts on their respective transaction documents. Where Airbnb is facilitating Collection and Remittance, Hosts are not permitted to collect any Occupancy Taxes being collected by Airbnb relating to their Accommodations in that jurisdiction.

13.5 Guests and Hosts agree that we may seek additional amounts from you in the event that the Taxes collected and/or remitted are insufficient to fully discharge your obligations to the Tax Authority, and agree that your sole remedy for Occupancy Taxes collected is a refund of Occupancy Taxes collected by Airbnb from the applicable Tax Authority in accordance with applicable procedures set by that Tax Authority.

13.6 Airbnb reserves the right, with prior notice to Hosts, to cease the Collection and Remittance in any jurisdiction for any reason at which point Hosts and Guests are once again solely responsible and liable for the collection and/or remittance of any and all Occupancy Taxes that may apply to Accommodations in that jurisdiction.

Members agree to cooperate with and assist Airbnb in good faith, and to provide Airbnb with such information and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by Airbnb with respect to any investigation undertaken by Airbnb or a representative of Airbnb regarding the use or abuse of the Airbnb Platform.

14.3 If you feel that any Member you interact with, whether online or in person, is acting or has acted inappropriately, including but not limited to anyone who (i) engages in offensive, violent or sexually inappropriate behavior, (ii) you suspect of stealing from you, or (iii) engages in any other disturbing conduct, you should immediately report such person to the appropriate authorities and then to Airbnb by contacting us with your police station and report number (if available). You agree that any report you make will not obligate us to take any action (beyond that required by law, if any).

#### 16\. Disclaimers

**Intentionally left blank**

#### 17\. Liability

**Airbnb is liable under statutory provisions for intent and gross negligence by us, our legal representatives, directors, or other vicarious agents. The same applies to the assumption of guarantees or any other strict liability, or in case of a culpable injury to life, limb, or health. Airbnb is liable for any negligent breaches of essential contractual obligations by us, our legal representatives, directors, or other vicarious agents; such liability is limited to the typically occurring foreseeable damages. Essential contractual obligations are such duties of Airbnb in whose proper fulfilment you regularly trust and must trust for the proper execution of the contract. Any additional liability of Airbnb is excluded.**

#### 18\. Indemnification

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to release, defend (at Airbnb’s option), indemnify, and hold Airbnb and its affiliates and subsidiaries, including but not limited to, Airbnb Payments, and their officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with (i) your breach of these Terms or our Policies or Standards, (ii) your improper use of the Airbnb Platform or any Airbnb Services, (iii) your interaction with any Member, stay at an Accommodation, participation in an Experience, Event or other Host Service, participation in the Group Payment Service, including without limitation any injuries, losses or damages (whether compensatory, direct, incidental, consequential or otherwise) of any kind arising in connection with or as a result of such interaction, stay, participation or use, or (iv) your breach of any laws, regulations or third party rights. The indemnification obligation according to this Section 18 only applies if and to the extent that the claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses have been adequately caused by your culpable breach of a contractual obligation.

#### 19\. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement

19.1 This Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement shall apply if you bring any claim against Airbnb in the United States (to the extent not in conflict with Section 21).

19.2 _Overview of Dispute Resolution Process_. Airbnb is committed to participating in a consumer-friendly dispute resolution process. To that end, these Terms provide for a two-part process for individuals to whom Section 19.1 applies: (1) an informal negotiation directly with Airbnb’s customer service team, and (2) a binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“**AAA**”) using its specially designed Consumer Arbitration Rules (as modified by this Section 19 and except as provided in Section 19.6). Specifically, the Consumer Arbitration Rules provide:

*   Claims can be filed with AAA online ([www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/));
*   Arbitrators must be neutral and no party may unilaterally select an arbitrator;
*   Arbitrators must disclose any bias, interest in the result of the arbitration, or relationship with any party;
*   Parties retain the right to seek relief in small claims court for certain claims, at their option;
*   The initial filing fee for the consumer is capped at $200;
*   The consumer gets to elect the hearing location and can elect to participate live, by phone, video conference, or, for claims under $25,000, by the submission of documents;
*   The arbitrator can grant any remedy that the parties could have received in court to resolve the party’s individual claim.

19.3 _Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution and Notification_. Prior to initiating an arbitration, you and Airbnb each agree to notify the other party of the dispute and attempt to negotiate an informal resolution to it first. We will contact you at the email address you have provided to us; you can contact Airbnb’s customer service team by emailing us. If after a good faith effort to negotiate one of us feels the dispute has not and cannot be resolved informally, the party intending to pursue arbitration agrees to notify the other party via email prior to initiating the arbitration. In order to initiate arbitration, a claim must be filed with the AAA and the written Demand for Arbitration (available at
