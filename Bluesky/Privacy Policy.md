They may include, but are not limited to, providing Bluesky and Services, resolving disputes, establishing legal defenses, conducting audits, pursuing legitimate business purposes, enforcing our agreements, for trust and safety purposes, and complying with applicable laws.

When determining the retention period, we make case-by-case determinations, taking into account various criteria, like the type of products and services requested by or provided to you, the nature and length of our relationship with you, the impact on Bluesky and the Services we provide to you if we delete some personal information from or about you, mandatory retention periods provided by law, and any relevant statute of limitations.

We generally retain Personal Data as follows:

*   **Trust and safety.** If we reasonably suspect you have violated our [Terms of Service](https://bsky.social/about/support/tos), or where we otherwise need to retain information to identify and report illegal activity or protect our users and third parties, we will retain relevant Personal Data for as long as necessary to conduct our investigations, assist with any governmental or non-governmental investigations, and to enforce any removal of offending users or content.
*   **Compliance with applicable laws and regulatory and contractual obligations.** For example: (i) identity record keeping / maintenance requirements in certain locations and financial / tax reporting requirements; (ii) if we receive a valid legal request (like a preservation request or search warrant, related to your Personal Data); (iii) complying with regulatory investigations or proceedings. We will delete your Personal Data sooner where a shorter retention period is required by applicable law.
*   **Legal claims.** Personal Data will be retained in accordance with applicable statutory limitation periods. In certain circumstances we may need to retain this longer, for example, to defend ourselves in litigation.
