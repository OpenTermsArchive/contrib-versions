Advertising and Cookie Policy
=============================

_Effective April 7, 2021._

This policy explains how cookies, mobile advertising identifiers, and similar technologies are used on our website and apps (together, “Nextdoor” or our “Services”).

**1\. What is a cookie?**

A cookie is a small file containing a unique identifier that is placed in the web browser of your computer or mobile device when you visit a site. Cookies and similar technologies (which include pixels, tags, web beacons, software development kits (“SDKs”) and local browser storage technologies) (together “cookies”) enable operators of sites/apps to recognise your device and collect information from it when you interact with them. They use this information to understand how the site/app is being used, remember user preferences and improve users’ browsing experience. Cookies are also used to make the advertising you see online more relevant to your interests.

**2\. What is a mobile advertising identifier?**

Most major phones and tablets include a mobile advertising identifier (e.g., an IDFA on iOS and an ADID on Android) that is a unique device identifier that enables third parties to connect you to your activities on that app to your activities on other unrelated apps and websites. This is generally used for personalising advertising and measurement of advertising campaigns. Even without a mobile advertising identifier, you’d still see advertising but those ads may be less relevant to you.

**3\. Who places cookies on my device?**

Cookies set by the site you visit are called “first party cookies” (i.e., cookies placed by Nextdoor). Cookies set by other parties are called “third party cookies.” Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality within the site, such as site analytics, advertising and social media features. The parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer or device both when it visits the site/app in question and also when it visits certain other sites/apps. We do not control how these third parties use your information, which is subject to their own privacy policies. See the table below for details of the use of third party cookies and similar technologies on Nextdoor.

**4\. What cookies does Nextdoor use, and why?**

The cookies used on our Services are categorised as follows:

● Strictly necessary cookies

● Functional cookies

● Targeting cookies

● Performance cookies

**Strictly necessary** cookies are necessary for our Services to function. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of our Services will not work and we will not be able to guarantee how the security on our Services will perform during your visit.

**Functional cookies** enable us to provide you with enhanced functionality and personalisation. If you do not add these cookies then some of our Services may not function properly.

**Targeting cookies** are used to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant information and advertisements. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.

**Performance cookies** collect information about how you use our Services (e.g., which pages you visit and if you experience any errors). These cookies are used to help us improve how our Service works, understand what interests our users and measure how effective our content is. If you do not allow these cookies, we will not know when you have visited our site.

Nextdoor uses both session cookies and persistent cookies:

● We use session cookies to identify you during a particular visit to Nextdoor. Session cookies expire after a short time, or when you close your web browser or app after using Nextdoor.

● We use persistent cookies to identify you over a long period of time. (For example, if you asked us to keep you signed in, we would use a persistent cookie for that purpose.) Persistent cookies remain on your device for a set period of time specified in the cookie.

We use both first and third party cookies to operate, understand and improve Nextdoor, specifically:

● _To authenticate you and secure our Services_: We use cookies to monitor login, session and status data. This allows us to know, for example, whether you are logged in.

● _To_ _remember your settings and preferences_: We use cookies to recognise your browser and remember your preferences. For example, we use cookies to remember your language preferences.

● _To_ _carry out analytics and research_: We use cookies to understand your use of Nextdoor and how we can improve our offerings. For example, we use cookies to track what pages you visit and whether you open emails we send you.

● _To_ _personalise your experience_: We use cookies to personalise your use of Nextdoor, including to serve you personalised advertising that may better suit your needs.

● _For fraud, trust and safety, and investigations:_ We use cookies to keep the Services safe, including to detect and prevent fraud and conduct investigations.

**5\. What third-party cookies are used on Nextdoor?**

A number of third party cookies are set on Nextdoor, some of which depend on how you use our Services. In general, the following types of third party cookies may be set when you use Nextdoor:

● _Social media login cookies:_ If you register or sign in using a social media login, they may set a cookie.

● _Analytics cookies:_ We use analytics cookies to collect traffic data to help us analyze how Members and Visitors access and use Nextdoor, and for other analytics services relating to website activity and internet usage.

● _Advertising cookies:_ The Services allow third party advertising companies that we work with to use cookies to collect information about how you use Nextdoor and other sites and services over time. These companies use the information they collect to show you ads they believe will be relevant to you on Nextdoor and elsewhere, and to measure how the ads perform.

● _Third-party cookies from content shared by Members:_ Members may share content on Nextdoor that originates from a third-party website or service, and that third-party website or service may set its own cookies when you interact with that content. For example, if a Member posts a video from YouTube on Nextdoor, YouTube may set a cookie when you click to watch the video.

● _Pixels_: Our advertising partners may use pixels or similar technology to measure the success of the sponsored posts or other advertising products they use. A “pixel” (also sometimes called web beacon, or clear GIF) is a tiny piece of code, invisible to the user, placed on a webpage or in an email and used in combination with a cookie, to link a given activity or impression back to the user; the advertiser includes it in its content so it can measure whether our Members interact with that content (for example, by clicking to view an offer). We may set our own pixel on an advertiser’s website so we can measure whether our Members found the advertiser’s content effective or interesting, by determining whether the sponsored post prompted Members to take advantage of the advertised offer. This information helps us assess whether sponsored posts and other advertising offers are relevant and interesting to our Members and successful for the advertiser.

● _SDKs:_ We and our partners and service providers include SDKs in the Nextdoor apps. SDKs include third party code and allow us to understand how our app is used and what actions occur in relation to the app, including when a Member signs up or logs in. SDKs are also used for advertising purposes including for measurement, personalisation and to create similar audiences to advertise to.

These cookies, the third parties that set them, the purposes of such cookies and the means by which you can opt out, are listed in the table further below.

**6\. Can I opt-out of use of my information for third party personalised advertising?**

Yes, here is how:

● _Browsers._ You may refuse or restrict the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser. However, limiting or refusing cookies may affect your ability to use Nextdoor. For more information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your computer or mobile device and how to manage and delete them, visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/). Some advertising networks offer you a way to opt-out of targeted advertising. For more information, please visit the Digital Advertising Alliance at [https://www.aboutads.info/choices](https://www.aboutads.info/choices) or the Network Advertising Initiative at [https://optout.networkadvertising.org](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/) (for US Members) or the European Digital Advertising Alliance at http://www.youronlinechoices.eu (for EU Members).

● _Mobile apps._ Your mobile device may include a feature that allows you to opt-out of some types of personalised advertising using your mobile advertising identifier, such as the “limit ad tracking” option in your iOS or Android device’s privacy settings. Visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s [mobile choices](http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice) page for more information. The Digital Advertising Alliance also provides a mobile app called [AppChoices](https://youradchoices.com/appchoices) that lets you opt-out of interest based advertising from participating advertisers.

● _Third parties._ Some of the third party advertising partners that we work with offer opt-out mechanisms, as listed in the table above. Since we do not control any of these opt-out links, we are not responsible for the availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.

Using these opt-out services will not prevent you from seeing all ads but may make the ads you do see less relevant to you. You will also need to set these opt-out preferences on each browser or device that you use.

Our business changes constantly and our cookie policy will also change, so please review it frequently. We will notify you of any changes by posting the updated policy on [this page](http://nextdoor.com/cookie_policy) with its effective date. If the change is material, we will take reasonable steps to notify you in advance as required by applicable law.
