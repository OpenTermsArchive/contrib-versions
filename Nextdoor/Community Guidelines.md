Community Guidelines   NeighboursPublic services
================================================

We’re glad you’re here. 
------------------------

We want everyone to feel welcome on Nextdoor, and we have created these Guidelines to define the values of the community we want to build. On Nextdoor, you’re connected not by a shared preference, but a shared connection to a place — your neighbourhood. Let’s build a strong one together.

You’re speaking to your real neighbours. Strong communities are built on strong relationships.

We do not tolerate racism, hateful language, or discrimination of any kind.

We have policies and dedicated spaces for important non-local topics, such as national politics.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nextdoor is built on trust — we want everyone to know they’re communicating with their real neighbour, and therefore require you to use your true identity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We prohibit any activity that could hurt someone, from physical harm to scams.  
 

You, our neighbours who make up Nextdoor, play a key role in neighbourhood [moderation](https://help.nextdoor.com/s/article/About-moderation?language=en_GB) by reporting content or neighbours that violate these Guidelines. Please remember that disagreeing with a post is not a reason to report it. This slows down our ability to remove content that is truly abusive and to create a platform where everyone feels welcome.
