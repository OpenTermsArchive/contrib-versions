Community Guidelines
====================

We’re glad you’re here. 
------------------------

We want everyone to feel welcome on Nextdoor, and we have created these Guidelines to define the values of the community we want to build. On Nextdoor, you’re connected not by a shared preference, but a shared connection to a place — your neighborhood. Let’s build a strong one together.

You, our neighbors who make up Nextdoor, play a key role in neighborhood [moderation](https://help.nextdoor.com/s/article/About-moderation?language=en_US) by reporting content or neighbors that violate these Guidelines. Please remember that disagreeing with a post is not a reason to report it. This slows down our ability to remove content that is truly abusive and to create a platform where everyone feels welcome.
