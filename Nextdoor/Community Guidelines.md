Community Guidelines
====================

We’re glad you’re here. 
------------------------

We want everyone to feel welcome on Nextdoor, and we have created these Guidelines to define the values of the community we want to build. On Nextdoor, you’re connected not by a shared preference, but a shared connection to a place — your neighbourhood. Let’s build a strong one together.

[1\. Be helpful in conversations](https://help.nextdoor.com/s/article/Be-helpful-in-conversations?language=en_GB)

Share this space in a constructive way. Be kind, not judgmental, in your conversations.  
 

[2\. Be respectful to your neighbours](https://help.nextdoor.com/s/article/Be-respectful-to-your-neighbors?language=en_GB)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You’re speaking to your real neighbours. Strong communities are built on strong relationships.   
 

[3\. Do not discriminate](https://help.nextdoor.com/s/article/Do-not-discriminate?language=en_GB)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We do not tolerate racism, hateful language, or discrimination of any kind.  
 

[4\. Do not engage in harmful activity](https://help.nextdoor.com/s/article/Do-not-engage-in-harmful-activity?language=en_GB)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We prohibit any activity that could hurt someone, from physical harm to scams.  
 

[5\. Promote local commerce the right way](https://help.nextdoor.com/s/article/promote-local-business-and-commerce-the-right-way?language=en_GB)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have created designated spaces for members and local businesses to sell products and services.   
 

[6\. Use your true identity](https://help.nextdoor.com/s/article/use-your-true-identity?language=en_GB)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nextdoor is built on trust — we want everyone to know they’re communicating with their real neighbour, and therefore require you to use your true identity.   
 

You, our members who make up Nextdoor, play a key role in neighbourhood [moderation](https://help.nextdoor.com/s/article/About-moderation?language=en_GB) by reporting content or members that violate these Guidelines. Please remember that disagreeing with a post is not a reason to report it. This slows down our ability to remove content that is truly abusive and to create a platform where everyone feels welcome.
