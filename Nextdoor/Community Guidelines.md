Community Guidelines   NeighboursPublic services
================================================

Hi neighbour. We’re glad you’re here. 
--------------------------------------

We want everyone to feel welcome on Nextdoor, and we have created these Guidelines to define the values of the community we want to build.

  
[1\.](https://help.nextdoor.com/s/article/Be-respectful-to-your-neighbors?language=en_US) [Be respectful to your neighbours](http://help.nextdoor.com/s/article/Be-respectful-to-your-neighbors?language=en_US)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You’re speaking to your real neighbours. Strong communities are built on strong relationships.

  
[2.](https://help.nextdoor.com/s/article/Do-not-discriminate?language=en_US) [Do not discriminate](http://help.nextdoor.com/s/article/Do-not-discriminate?language=en_US)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We do not tolerate racism, hateful language, or discrimination of any kind.

  
[3\.](https://help.nextdoor.com/s/article/Be-helpful-in-conversations?language=en_US) [Discuss important topics in the right place](http://help.nextdoor.com/s/article/Be-helpful-in-conversations?language=en_US)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have policies and dedicated spaces for important non-local topics, such as national politics.  
 

[4\.](https://help.nextdoor.com/s/article/use-your-true-identity) [Use your true identity](http://help.nextdoor.com/s/article/use-your-true-identity)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nextdoor is built on trust — we want everyone to know they’re communicating with their real neighbour, and therefore require you to use your true identity.   
 

[5\.](https://help.nextdoor.com/s/article/Do-not-engage-in-harmful-activity?language=en_US) [Do not engage in harmful activity](http://help.nextdoor.com/s/article/Do-not-engage-in-harmful-activity?language=en_US)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We prohibit any activity that could hurt someone, from physical harm to scams.  
 

You, our neighbours who make up Nextdoor, play a key role in neighbourhood [moderation](https://help.nextdoor.com/s/article/About-moderation?language=en_US) by reporting content or neighbours that violate these Guidelines. Please remember that disagreeing with a post is not a reason to report it. This slows down our ability to remove content that is truly abusive and to create a platform where everyone feels welcome.
