For What Purposes Does Amazon Use Your Personal Information?
------------------------------------------------------------

We use your personal information to operate, provide, develop, and improve the products and services that we offer our customers. These purposes include:

*   **Purchase and delivery of products and services.** We use your personal information to take and handle orders, deliver products and services, process payments, and communicate with you about orders, products and services, and promotional offers.
*   **Provide, troubleshoot, and improve Amazon Services.** We use your personal information to provide functionality, analyze performance, fix errors, and improve the usability and effectiveness of the Amazon Services.
*   **Recommendations and personalization.** We use your personal information to recommend features, products, and services that might be of interest to you, identify your preferences, and personalize your experience with Amazon Services.
*   **Provide voice, image and camera services.** When you use our voice, image and camera services, we use your voice input, images, videos, and other personal information to respond to your requests, provide the requested service to you, and improve our services.

*   **Communicate with you.** We use your personal information to communicate with you in relation to Amazon Services via different channels (e.g., by phone, email, chat).
*   **Advertising.** We use your personal information to display interest-based ads for features, products, and services that might be of interest to you. We do not use information that personally identifies you to display interest-based ads. To learn more, please read our [Interest-Based Ads](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=202075050) notice.
*   **Fraud Prevention and Credit Risks.** We use personal information to prevent and detect fraud and abuse in order to protect the security of our customers, Amazon, and others. We may also use scoring methods to assess and manage credit risks.

What About Cookies and Other Identifiers?
-----------------------------------------

To enable our systems to recognize your browser or device and to provide and improve Amazon Services, we use cookies and other identifiers. For more information about cookies and how we use them, please read our [Cookies Notice](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=201890250).

Does Amazon Share Your Personal Information?
--------------------------------------------

Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling our customers' personal information to others. We share customers' personal information only as described below and with subsidiaries Amazon.com, Inc. controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.

*   **Transactions involving Third Parties:** We make available to you services, products, applications, or skills provided by third parties for use on or through Amazon Services. For example, you can order products from third parties through our stores, download applications from third-party application providers from our App Store, and enable third-party skills through our Alexa services. We also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party businesses, such as co-branded credit cards. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share customers' personal information related to those transactions with that third party.
*   **Third-Party Service Providers:** We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages, sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing payments, transmitting content, scoring, assessing and managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These third-party service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
*   **Business Transfers:** As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon.com, Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
*   **Protection of Amazon and Others:** We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our [Conditions of Use](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909000) and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal information about you might be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

How Secure Is Information About Me?
-----------------------------------

We design our systems with your security and privacy in mind.

*   We work to protect the security of your personal information during transmission by using encryption protocols and software.
*   We follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) when handling credit card data.
*   We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage, and disclosure of personal customer information. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you.
*   Our devices offer security features to protect them against unauthorized access and loss of data. You can control these features and configure them based on your needs. Click [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200127470) for more information on how to manage the security settings of your device.
*   It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computers, devices, and applications. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. Click [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201293120) for more information on how to sign off.

What About Advertising?
-----------------------

*   **Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites:** Amazon Services may include third-party advertising and links to other websites and apps. Third-party advertising partners may collect information about you when you interact with their content, advertising, and services. For more information about third-party advertising at Amazon, including interest-based ads, please read our [Interest-Based Ads](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=202075050) policy. To adjust your advertising preferences, please go to the [Advertising Preferences](https://www.amazon.com/adprefs) page.
*   **Use of Third-Party Advertising Services:** We provide ad companies with information that allows them to serve you with more useful and relevant Amazon ads and to measure their effectiveness. We never share your name or other information that directly identifies you when we do this. Instead, we use an advertising identifier like a cookie or other device identifier. For example, if you have already downloaded one of our apps, we will share your advertising identifier and data about that event so that you will not be served an ad to download the app again. Some ad companies also use this information to serve you relevant ads from other advertisers. You can learn more about how to opt-out of interest-based advertising by going to the [Advertising Preferences](https://www.amazon.com/adprefs) page.

What Information Can I Access?
------------------------------

You can access your information, including your name, address, payment options, profile information, Prime membership, household settings, and purchase history in the "Your Account" section of the website. Click [here](#GUID-8966E75F-9B92-4A2B-BFD5-967D57513A40__SECTION_87C837F9CCD84769B4AE2BEB14AF4F01) for a list of examples that you can access.

What Choices Do I Have?
-----------------------

If you have any questions as to how we collect and use your personal information, please contact our [Customer Service](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/contact-us). Many of our Amazon Services also include settings that provide you with options as to how your information is being used.

*   As described above, you can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of the Amazon Services.
*   You can add or update certain information on pages such as those referenced in [What Information Can I Access?](#GUID-8966E75F-9B92-4A2B-BFD5-967D57513A40__SECTION_87C837F9CCD84769B4AE2BEB14AF4F01). When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.
*   If you do not want to receive email or other communications from us, please adjust your [Customer Communication Preferences](https://www.amazon.com/gp/cpc/homepage?ref=gss_to_cpc). If you don't want to receive in-app notifications from us, please adjust your notification settings in the app or device.
*   If you do not want to see interest-based ads, please adjust your [Advertising Preferences](https://www.amazon.com/adprefs).
*   The Help feature on most browsers and devices will tell you how to prevent your browser or device from accepting new cookies or other identifiers, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to block cookies altogether. Because cookies and identifiers allow you to take advantage of some essential features of Amazon Services, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use any Services that require you to Sign in. For more information about cookies and other identifiers, see our [Cookies Notice](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=201890250).

*   You will also be able to opt out of certain other types of data usage by updating your settings on the applicable Amazon website (e.g., in "Manage Your Content and Devices"), device, or application. For more information click [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GQFYXZHZB2H629WN). Most non-Amazon devices also provide users with the ability to change device permissions (e.g., disable/access location services, contacts). For most devices, these controls are located in the device's settings menu. If you have questions about how to change your device permissions on devices manufactured by third parties, we recommend you contact your mobile service carrier or your device manufacturer.
*   If you are a seller, you can add or update certain information in [Seller Central](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/), update your account information by accessing your [Seller Account Information](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/hz/sc/account-information), and adjust your email or other communications you receive from us by updating your [Notification Preferences](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/notifications/preferences/ref=xx_notifpref_dnav_xx).
*   If you are an author, you can add or update the information you have provided in the [Author Portal](https://authorcentral.amazon.com/gp/help?topicID=200649520) and [Author Central](https://authorcentral.amazon.com/) by accessing your accounts in the Author Portal and Author Central, respectively.

In addition, to the extent required by applicable law, you may have the right to request access to or delete your personal data. If you wish to do any of these things, please contact [Customer Service](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/contact-us). Depending on your data choices, certain services may be limited or unavailable.
