GENERAL TERMS OF SERVICE

Latest version dated 11 June 2020



The purpose of the present General Terms of Service is to define the terms and conditions for the provision

and use of OVHcloud Services.

These General Terms of Service form, together with the applicable Specific Terms of Service and all of the

documents which they make reference to, constitute a single contract (hereinafter the “Contract”) between

OVH HOSTING LIMITED, headquartered at Enterprise House, O’Brien Rd, Carlow, and registered under

number 468585 (hereafter known as “OVHcloud”), and any physical or legal person, consumer or business,

governed by private or public law, creating a Client Account on the OVHcloud Website (hereafter known as

the “Client” or “Customer”). The Client and OVHcloud are individually and jointly known as the “Party” or

“Parties”, respectively.

Expressions beginning with an upper-case letter are defined within the present General Terms of Service, or

in the OVHcloud Glossary, available on the OVHcloud Website and hereafter in the Article 12.



ARTICLE 1: ORDERING SERVICES



1.1. Client Account. To be able to order OVHcloud Services, the Client must have a valid Client Account.

The Client creates its Client Account online within the OVHcloud Website. The Client shall provide all the

required information (email address, name, address, bank details, etc.), and undertakes that all of the

information thus provided is correct and up to date throughout the entire duration of the Contract. When a

Client Account is created and used by a third party, such person shall be considered as acting in the name

and on behalf of the Client and having full power and authority to enter into and perform this Contract on

behalf of the Client.



1.2. Activation of the Client Account. Prior to the activation of the Client Account, as well as at any time

while the Contract is in effect, OVHcloud reserves the right to verify the accuracy of the information sent by or

for the Client Account, and to request supporting documents from the Client. OVHcloud reserves the right

not to activate, or to deactivate, the Client Account in the event that any of the information provided by the

Client is incomplete, inaccurate, or fraudulent.



1.3. Orders. Once its Client Account has been activated by OVHcloud, the Client can order Services.

Depending on Services, Orders can be sent using the OVHcloud Website and/or directly using the Client’s

Management Interface and/or using an API which OVHcloud may provide for said purpose. The Client is solely

responsible for the management of its Client Account and associated authentication credentials (user

names, passwords, etc.). Any Order for Services sent from the Client Account is deemed to have been

submitted by the Client and is binding on the Client. The terms and timescales for the provision of Services

vary depending on the Service ordered. Some Services are made available only upon receipt by OVHcloud of

payment from the Client in advance for the relevant Services. It is the responsibility of the Client to ensure

that the delivery terms for the ordered Services meet its needs.



ARTICLE 2: SERVICES



2.1. Applicable Terms of Service. The provision and use of the Services are governed by these General

Terms of Service, the Data Processing Agreement, the Specific Terms of Services applicable to the concerned

Services, any other conditions referred by the General Terms of Services and Specific Terms of Service, such

as Third Party Product Terms of Use and OVHcloud Deontological Charter, along with any other information

given to the Client during the Order (“Terms of Service”). The use of Third Party Products (such as software

programs, systems, applications, etc.) provided by OVHcloud in the provision of the Services may be subject

to specific terms of use (referred to as Third Party Product Terms of Use). The Special Terms of Service, and

2/18



the Third Party Product Terms of Use supplement these General Terms of Service. In the event of

contradiction, the Specific Terms of Service, as well as the General Terms of Service, shall prevail over the

Third Party Product Terms of Use. The General Terms of Service in effect are available on the OVHcloud

website , and may be sent to the Client upon request addressed to OVHcloud Support. The Terms of Service

may vary depending on the country where the Services are located.



2.2. Information related to the Services. OVHcloud makes available to the Client via the OVHcloud

Website, online resources which enable the Client to be informed of the characteristics of the Services

offered. These resources may include, in particular, (a) information regarding various available features,

configurations, options and ranges and(b) documentation, technical guides and/or examples (or use cases)

on using the Services so as to facilitate better understanding and use of the Services. The Client may obtain

additional information regarding the Services by contacting OVHcloud Support in accordance with article 4

below. In cases where OVHcloud offers Services which comply with known standards or specific regulations

which apply to certain activities, OVHcloud shall communicate its scope of responsibility as well as the

conditions in which OVHcloud complies with said standards or regulations.



2.3. OVHcloud commitments and obligations. OVHcloud undertakes to exercise reasonable care and skill

in providing Services in accordance with the characteristics, terms and levels of Service stated in the

Contract. In particular, OVHcloud agrees to exercise reasonable skill and care in keeping in place a

competent team responsible for assisting the Client and handling Incidents (“OVHcloud Support”) and

ensuring the availability and security of Services in accordance with the applicable terms and performance

levels.



2.4. Subcontracting. Subject to the provisions of the Data Processing Agreement, OVHcloud may

subcontract all or part of the Services to its Affiliates. Within the scope of the Contract, OVHcloud may freely

recourse to third parties (such as energy providers, network providers, network interconnection point

managers or collocated datacenters, material and software providers, carriers, technical providers, security

company), without having to inform the Client or sollicitate it prior approval. However, subject to

contradictory provisions of Specific Terms of Service in effect or Client’s specific agreement, no performance

implying access to the Content stored by the Client within the scope of the Services shall be subcontracted

outside of OVHcloud Group. OVHcloud shall in all cases remain primarily liable for the provision of the

subcontracted Services.



ARTICLE 3: TERMS OF USE OF THE SERVICES



3.1. Compliance with the Terms of Service. The Client agrees to order and use the Services in accordance

with the Terms of Service in effect. The Services must be used in good faith. In particular, the Client

undertakes to comply with these General Terms of Service, the Specific Terms of Service, the Data Processing

Agreement and the applicable Third Party Product Terms of Use, as well as any information communicated

to the Client at the time of the Order. When using the Services on behalf of a third party, or authorizing a third

party to use the Service, the Client undertakes to communicate the relevant terms to that third party and

procure compliance of the same by the relevant third party.



3.2. Selection of Services. Before ordering and using the Services, the Client shall familiarize itself with all

of the applicable Terms of Services (in particular, the Specific Terms of Service and the Third Party Product

Terms of Use), and study all of the documentation, configuration, options and ranges of services available, in

order to select Services and characteristics suited to the Client's needs and those of the third parties for

whom or on whose behalf the Services will be used. In particular, the Client shall verify that the Services are

suited to the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to the activities performed within the scope of the

use of the Services. In order to obtain any additional information regarding the Services, the Client may

contact OVHcloud Support as set out in article “OVHcloud Support” hereafter. The terms and characteristics

of the Services shall be updated regularly. The Client is responsible to take note of these updates,

particularly when placing new orders.

3/18



3.3. Connection. To use the Services, the Client must ensure that it has access to a remote connection (such

as the Internet or a private network), which it is solely responsible for and bears the costs of. The Client is

hereby informed that the Internet presents technical hazards and security risks that are external to the

technical measures employed by OVHcloud in the provision of the Services. OVHcloud shall not be held liable

for any faults by Internet access providers or other third party data transport networks (including but not

limited to lack of reliability of connection lines, bandwidth fluctuations, connection interruptions, etc.), nor

for the consequences of said faults, particularly in cases when they result in the unavailability or

discontinuity of the Services.



3.4. Means of authentication. The Client is responsible for the management and confidentiality of the

necessary means of authentication for connecting to and using the Services. The Client shall ensure that the

Users are knowledgeable of and follow standard practices which enable them to maintain the confidentiality

of their authentication credentials. The Client is solely responsible for any consequences which may arise

from the loss, disclosure, or fraudulent or illicit use of the authentication credentials provided to Users.

OVHcloud shall in no way be held liable in this regard. The Client undertakes to immediately inform

OVHcloud of any loss or disclosure of any authentication credentials, and immediately proceed with

changing said authentication credentials.



3.5. Content. With the exception of items provided by OVHcloud, OVHcloud does not intervene in the

handling of information, data, files, systems, applications, websites and other items which are reproduced,

hosted, collected, stored, transmitted, distributed, published, and more generally used and/or operated by

the Client within the scope of the Services (collectively known as Content), and is forbidden from accessing

said Content for any other purpose than as necessary for the execution of the Services. OVHcloud does not

perform any verification, validation or update operations on said Content. Likewise, OVHcloud does not

perform any particular backups of Content stored in the scope of the Services. Therefore, the Client is solely

responsible for taking all necessary measures to safeguard its data in order to protect it against risk of loss or

degradation regardless of cause. The Client shall ensure that the Content is legal and used in accordance

with applicable industry standards, laws and regulations. Any use of illegal or fraudulent Content (such as

the distribution, publication, storage or transmission of content of sexually explicit material, content that is

obscene, offensive, hateful or inflammatory, incites crimes against humanity, acts of terrorism, paedophilia,

anti-Semitism, racism, or content inciting hatred or discrimination towards individuals by reason of their

gender, religion, sexual orientation or identity, or disability), or the illegal or abusive use of Content (for

example, fraudulent use of content, or use of content in violation of rights belonging to a third party such as

personality rights, copyrights, patents, brands or other intellectual property rights) within the scope of

Services is prohibited, and can lead to, at the sole discretion of OVHcloud, the immediate suspension of all or

part of the Services provided under the Contract, the deactivation of the Client Account and/or the

termination of the Contract by OVHcloud, without prejudice to OVHcloud's other rights and remedies under

the Contract or at law.



3.6. Compliance with laws and regulations and the OVHcloud Deontological Charter. The Client shall

use the Services in a reasonable manner, in accordance with the OVHcloud Deontological Charter available

on the OVHcloud Website and shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations. The Client undertakes to

remain attentive to any updates or changes to said Deontological Charter sent by OVHcloud. Explicitly

forbidden actions include, but are not limited to, (a) abuse, fraudulent or excessive use of the Services and

resources made available to the Client, particularly any use of a nature that threatens the stability and

security of the OVHcloud systems or which can result in a degradation of the performance of the Services

provided to other OVHcloud clients, (b) intrusions or intrusion attempts launched from the Services

(including, but not limited to, port scanning, sniffing, spoofing, and more generally, attacks on external

parties originating from resources made available by OVHcloud), (c) any use or attempted use of spam or any

other technique similar to spamming, and (d) use of illicit or prohibited content as specified in paragraph 3.5,

4/18



3.7. Suspension of Services. OVHcloud reserves the right to suspend all or part of the Services in the event

of (a) a known risk to the stability and/or security of the OVHcloud systems or environment by the Services

and/or Client Content, (b) scheduled maintenance, or (c) a request issued by a legal authority or competent

judicial authority (d) non-compliance of the Client with all or part of the Terms of Services. Said suspension

may occur immediately and without prior notice in case of urgency or necessity, and particularly in the case

of an event such as described in point (a) and (c) above, or in case of illicit or fraudulent use of the Services,

or use that is in violation of the rights of a third party, and more generally, of any use which may bind the

liability of OVHcloud. Except in relation to cases of judicial or legal requisitioning or non-compliance with the

Terms of Services, OVHcloud shall endeavour to minimise the impact of a suspension on the normal

operations of the Services. Any such suspensions shall in no way release the Client from its obligation to pay

the entirety of the amounts due to OVHcloud under the Contract, which is without prejudice to the Client’s

right to engage OVHcloud’s liability in accordance with article “Liability” hereafter in case such suspensions

result from OVHcloud’s failure to fulfil its obligations. The Client can consult the maintenance schedule using

the interface provided for this purpose. In the event any such suspension results in a failure by the Client to

fulfil its obligations under the Contract, the suspension shall take place without prejudice to OVHcloud’s

right to terminate the Contract in accordance with article “Duration, Renewal and Termination of Services”

hereafter, and without prejudice to OVHcloud's other rights and remedies at law. Except in cases of

termination or non-renewal of Services, suspensions of Services shall not result in the deletion of the Client’s

data. Unless suspensions result exclusively of OVHcloud’s failure to fulfil its obligations, the duration of the

aforementioned suspensions shall not count as unavailability of Services in respect with the service level

agreement provided in the Agreement.



3.8. Updates to Services. OVHcloud may modify the Services at any time, and may add, modify or remove

ranges, options or features, as well as upgrade their performance. The Services are described online on the

OVHcloud Website. The Client is responsible for keeping abreast of any updates to the Services, which are

immediately applicable to any new Orders. Concerning the Services in use by the Client, the latter shall be

informed by email or via its Management Interface of any substantial updates which are of a nature to

downgrade said Services, at least thirty (30) calendar days before the implementation of said update.

Nevertheless, modifications to Third Party Products and urgent cases (such as security risks, or legal or

regulatory compliance updates) may result in immediate modifications to the Services. Subject to the article

“Condition Specific to Consumers”, in case of an update that degrades existing Services in use by the Client

(removal of functionality, performance downgrade, etc.), the Client may terminate the relevant Services by

registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt, or through a specific form provided in its Management

Interface, within thirty (30) days from the date the relevant update is implemented.



3.9. Intellectual property. Usage rights. All of the items (software, Infrastructure, documentation, etc.)

made available to the Client by OVHcloud in the provision of the Services and during the term of the Contract

remain the exclusive property of OVHcloud or the third parties which have granted the rights to use them.

OVHcloud grants the Client a non-exclusive licence to use the items made available to it only in accordance

with and for the duration of the present Contract. With the exception of the aforementioned items made

available to the Client by OVHcloud in the provision of the Services, the Client remains solely responsible for

acquiring all of the authorisations and usage rights for the elements and Content (data, software,

applications, systems, websites, etc.) which it uses and operates in relation to the Services. The Client and

Users retain all intellectual property rights in their respective Content which OVHcloud shall not use expect

to the extent necessary for the performance of the Services. Subject to mandatory legal provisions in effect,

the Client is not authorized to decompile the software, source code and algorithms used in the course of

supplying the Services, notably to reverse-engineer.



3.10. Export Controls. Subject to the restrictions of use (a) provided for under the Terms of Service, or (b)

specific to the Client’s business, OVHcloud shall ensure that the Services can be commercialized and used in

the European Union and countries where the Datacenters used to provide the Services are located. If the

Client uses the Services, or authorizes third parties to use the Services, from a geographical zone located

outside the country where the Datacenters are located, the Client is responsible to verify that this use is not

subject to any restrictions arising from applicable legislation or regulations, notably regulation EC 428/2009

5/18



from the European Council dated 5 May 2009 setting up a Community regime for the control of exports,

transfer, brokering and transit of dual-use items, as well as United States regulations such as the EAR (Export

Administration Regulations) and ITAR (International Traffic In Arms Regulations), given that OVHcloud

commercializes third party solutions provided by vendors subject to the regulations of the United States.

OVHcloud reserves the right to refuse orders submitted (a) from countries subject to commercial restrictions

or other sanctions, or (b) by citizens of those countries or individuals subject to sanctions.



3.11. Third Party Products. Subject to specific commitments undertaken within the scope of the

applicable Specific Terms of Service, (a) OVHcloud is not responsible for Third Party Products made available

within the scope of the Services which may contain technical errors, security vulnerabilities,

incompatibilities or instabilities, and offers no guarantee for the Third Party Products made available by

OVHcloud to the Client in the provision of the Services (including all related information and items such as

software, systems, applications, etc.), and (b) the Client is only authorised to use the Third Party Products

made available to it by OVHcloud in accordance with the terms of the Contract, and in particular is forbidden

from decompiling, accessing the source code, reinstalling on any other infrastructure software or systems

made available to it. The Client uses the Third-Party Products entirely at its own risk, in accordance with

these Terms of Service, and is responsible to ensure that such Services are suited to its needs and the

purposes for which it uses them.



3.12. Continuity and Reversibility of Services. Unless provided otherwise in the Specific Terms of Service,

the termination of Services for any reason whatsoever (in particular, the termination or non-renewal of the

Contract, failure to comply with the Terms of Service, etc.), as well as certain operations to update or

reinstall the Services, shall automatically result in the irreversible deletion of all Content (including

information, data, files, systems, applications, websites, and other items) that is reproduced, stored, hosted,

collected, transmitted, distributed, published and more generally used and/or operated by the Client within

the scope of the Services, including any potential backup. Before the termination or expiry of the Services,

and before proceeding with any delete operations, update or reinstallation of Services, the Client is solely

responsible to perform any operations (such as backup, transfer to a third party solution, Snapshots, etc.)

which are necessary to the preservation of its own Content. Upon request from the Client, and subject to the

stipulations of the article on “Confidentiality” below, OVHcloud shall provide any technical information

concerning the Services which may facilitate reversibility operations and the Client’s Content recovery. Such

provision of assistance may result in additional charges for time worked, based on the financial terms

available on the OVHcloud Website or upon request to OVHcloud Support. However, OVHcloud does not

proceed to any operation of restitution or Client’s Contents migration. Such operations are under the Client’s

exclusive responsibility. With the exception of any data which OVHcloud must preserve in accordance with

applicable laws and regulations, the data referred to in article “OVHcloud processes” below, and any data

necessary for the defence of its rights, OVHcloud undertakes not to keep a copy of the Client's data following

the termination of Services, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties or provided otherwise in the applicable

Specific Terms of Service..



ARTICLE 4: OVHcloud SUPPORT



4.1. The OVHcloud Support team. The OVHcloud Support team is responsible for handling Incidents which

may occur in relation to the Services, and to provide the Client, upon request, with information regarding the

characteristics and Terms of Services. Provided the other levels of Support referred to in article 4.4 below,

OVHcloud Support is available in English only and information regarding the Services is available during

business hours only. OVHcloud infrastructures are monitored 24/7, 365 days a year. In order to ensure the

continuity of this monitoring handling on a 24/7/365 basis, OVHcloud reserves the right to subcontract part

of the Support in accordance with articles “Subcontract” and “the Data Processing Agreement”.



4.2. Recourse to OVHcloud Support. The Client may contact the OVHcloud Support by email, using a

special form available in the Management Interface, or by telephone by calling + 353 (0)1 691 72 83.

Nevertheless, during non-business hours, the OVHcloud Support team can only be reached by email or

6/18



through the Management Interface. OVHcloud shall create a ticket (“Incident Ticket”) for each request or

Incident report received. The Client shall be informed by email of the creation of the Incident Ticket and its

corresponding number. The Client can access the history and status of its requests and Incidents reported

through its Management Interface. The Client undertakes not to make use of the OVHcloud Support

wrongfully. Before resorting to the OVHcloud Support, the Client must first consult the resources and

information available on the OVHcloud Website (user guides, use cases, product documentation, etc.), and in

its Management Interface (reporting, monitoring, etc.). The Client shall not (i) contact the OVHcloud Support

for services or products that it has not contracted from OVHcloud directly or(ii) place the OVHcloud Support

teams in direct contact with its own clients or any other party external to the Contract. OVHcloud reserves

the right to refuse to accept any request which does not meet the aforementioned conditions. The Client

undertakes to adopt behaviour that is appropriate, cordial and respectful in its interactions with OVH

Support. OVHcloud reserves the right to no longer reply to the Client’s requests and to immediately

terminate the Contract in case of abusive, outrageous, or degrading behaviour. Furthermore, such behaviour

may result in legal action taken against the Client, for which purposes OVHcloud may resort to any means of

evidence which it deems useful and relevant (extracts of communications with the Client, screenshots,

emails, recording of telephone calls, etc.). Subject to the other levels of Support referred to in article 4.4

below, OVHcloud Support is included in the price of the Services.



4.3. Incident handling. In case of malfunction of the Services, the Client shall firstly perform the technical

tests recommended on the OVHcloud Website. In the event these tests do not resolve the Incident, the Client

may report the Incident to the OVHcloud Support as set out above, and provide as much information as

possible to facilitate a proper diagnosis. When an Incident is reported, OVHcloud Support shall carry out the

necessary investigation to identify the cause of the observed malfunction and establish a diagnosis. The

Client agrees to remain available at all times in order to collaborate with OVHcloud on a proper diagnosis

and resolution of the Incident, in particular by providing OVHcloud with any additional information, and by

performing all of the necessary tests and verifications. Within the scope of Incident handling, OVHcloud and

its partner companies are expressly authorized by the Client to connect to the Client Services at both the

hardware and software levels, in order to take any action that is necessary to perform a diagnosis. This

connection may require the Client to perform an action on its Service. OVHcloud shall keep the Client

reasonably well-informed of the progress of the operations. If OVHcloud establishes that its Services are

available and functioning properly, or that the existence of the Incident cannot be confirmed, or that the

Incident does not fall under the responsibility of OVHcloud, OVHcloud shall inform the Client accordingly. In

this case, the time spent by OVHcloud on performing the diagnosis and assisting the Client may be charged

to the Client as an additional service provided, based on the fee schedule available on the OVHcloud Website

or provided to the Client. OVHcloud reserves the right to refuse any assistance if it ascertains, during its

investigation, that the Client is using the Service in violation of the Contract or of any applicable law or

regulation. If the Incident appears to fall under OVHcloud’s responsibility, OVHcloud shall finish the diagnosis

and work to re-establish the availability of the impacted Services. In this case, the work performed by

OVHcloud shall not result in any additional charges. The diagnosis shall be established by OVHcloud using

any means necessary, and particularly based on exchanges between the Parties and data from the OVHcloud

information system (such as login data) which the Client hereby expressly agrees may be admissible and fully

enforceable. Subject to any applicable Specific Terms of Service and other levels of Support referred to in

article 4.4 below, OVHcloud does not provide any warranty as to the duration of repairs or time frames for

the resolution of Incidents within the scope of the OVHcloud Support.



4.4. Other levels of Support. In addition to the OVHcloud standard Support described above, OVHcloud

offers other levels of Support which allow the Client to benefit from additional services and levels of

commitment. The terms and conditions for these Support levels are described in Specific Terms of Service

and corresponding documentations available on the OVHcloud Website or upon request to OVHcloud

Support.

ARTICLE 6: FINANCIAL CONDITIONS



6.1. Price of Services. The prices of the Services invoiced to the Client are those in effect at the time of

invoicing, as published on the OVHcloud Website. The prices may also be communicated upon request sent

to OVHcloud Support. Unless stipulated otherwise, all prices are in Euros. OVHcloud offers different types of

rates depending on the type of Service (monthly flat-rate, yearly flat-rate, per use pricing, etc.). These rates

may be linked to a commitment to a particular period of use and/or a specific method of invoicing. Should

several types of prices be available for the same Service, the Client may select the one of its choosing when

submitting its Order. When prices are listed excluding taxes (in particular, prices for Services designed for

businesses), the VAT as well as all other taxes applicable to the Services (excluding taxes on OVHcloud

revenue) shall be added to the price of the Services and due by the Client without this being deemed a

change in the price as envisaged by article 6.2 of this Contract. In the absence of a special pricing scheme, the

prices of the Services shall include the cost of acquisition of the licenses and rights to use the tools, software

and Operating Systems used by OVHcloud and/or which are made available to the Client by OVHcloud within

the scope of the Services. The Client is responsible for acquiring and fulfilling its obligations in respect of all

licenses and usage rights that are necessary to operate or make use of the Content within the scope of the

Services. The methods for calculating the price of the Services, as well as the billing units, are defined on the

OVHcloud Website and in the applicable Specific Terms of Service. The Client is responsible for taking note of

this before submitting its order. Each billing unit begun shall be invoiced and due in full, even when it is not

totally used. Some Services shall incur additional installation or commissioning costs.



6.2. Changes to prices. OVHcloud reserves the right to change its prices at any time. Pricing changes are

immediately applicable to any new Orders. For Services in use at the time of an increase in their price, the

Client shall be informed of the change by email at least thirty (30) calendar days in advance. In such a case

and subject to article “Conditions Specific to Consumers” the Client has the right to terminate without

penalty the impacted Services within thirty (30) calendar days upon the notification of the said price

increase. Such termination shall be notified by registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt or through

a specific form provided in the Management Interface. In the absence of said termination, the Client shall be

deemed to have accepted the new prices.



6.3. Invoicing. The Services shall be invoiced on the basis of Client Orders and consumption of Services as

established by OVHcloud in its information system, which shall be deemed as admissible and fully

enforceable to the Client. The periodicity (monthly, yearly, or other) of invoices and the timing of their

issuance (upon ordering or in arrears) varies from one Service to another. The terms of invoicing of the prices

of the Services are defined on the OVHcloud Website and in the applicable Specific Terms of Service. The

Client is responsible for taking note of these before submitting its Order. After each payment, OVHcloud shall

send the Client an invoice. The Client expressly agrees that this invoice shall be sent to it electronically. The

invoice is sent to the Client by email and/or made available to the Client through the Management Interface.

The Client is responsible for keeping a copy of the invoice in accordance with regulations in effect. Invoices

made available to the Client in the Management Interface shall remain available for a period of twelve (12)

months following the date made available.



6.4. Payment. Invoices are payable on receipt, it being understood that invoices are issued either at the

time of the Order, or in arrears, depending on the Service. The Client is responsible for selecting its desired

payment method from among the available payment methods in the Management Interface. The available

payment methods may vary from one Service to another. The Client is responsible for taking note of this

before submitting its Order. In relation to Services payable in arrears, OVHcloud reserves the right to invoice

the Client for said Services before the end of a calendar month in the event that the total Services consumed

by the Client during the month in question reach a significant amount. The Client is fully responsible for

payment of Services in accordance with the article “Financial Conditions”. The Client undertakes to select a

valid payment method in its Client Account, and to dispose of the necessary funds to render payment for the

Services. Provided the cancellation right of article “Conditions Specific to Consumers”, the Client remains

liable to settle the price in its entirety and shall have no claim to any reimbursement resulting from the non-

10/18



use, the partial-use, suspension or cessation of the use of Services before the end of the Period of Use which

is without prejudice to the Client’s right to engage OVHcloud’s liability in accordance with article “Liability”

hereafter in case such situation results from OVHcloud’s failure to fulfil its obligations.



6.5. Default or late payment. In case of default or late payment, including partial payment, the Client shall

be liable to pay late payment penalties due the day following the payment due date and OVHcloud shall have

the right to charge interest on the overdue amount at the applicable rate under the European Communities

(Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2002 , accruing on a daily basis from the due date

up to the date of actual payment, whether before or after judgement.. Furthermore, any default or delay of

payment (including partial) of the sums due by the Client under the Contract which persists for more than

four (4) days after notification of default or delay of payment sent to the Client by email, shall result by right,

and without requiring any additional notification or formal notice, in (a) the immediate demand of all of the

sums remaining due by the Client under the Contract regardless of their payment terms, and (b) the right of

OVHcloud to decide to immediately suspend and without prior notice all or part of the Client Services

(including those which have been paid for), to refuse any new Order or renewal of Services to the Client and

to terminate all or part of the Contract . In case of default or late payment, business Clients shall be liable to

pay a fixed recovery fee of forty (40) Euros, without prejudice to OVHcloud’s right to demand, upon

supporting documents, additional compensation in cases where the recovery fees are greater than the

amount of said fixed recovery fee.



6.6. Contestation. In the event of any disagreement regarding invoicing or the nature of the Services, the

Client must notify OVHcloud Support through its Management Interface within one (1) month of the date the

invoice was issued. In the absence of said notification, and without prejudice to the Client’s right to contest

the invoice later on, the Client shall be liable to settle all unpaid invoices according to the terms of the

Contract. In case of failure to invoice the Services correctly or in the appropriate timeframe, OVHcloud

reserves the right invoice or correct the invoicing at any time, subject to any mandatory applicable

limitation.



ARTICLE 7: DURATION, RENEWAL AND TERMINATION OF SERVICES



7.1. Duration of Services. The Contract is entered into for an indeterminate period of time and remains in

effect so long as the Client uses the OVHcloud Services. The duration for which the Client undertakes to use

the ordered Services is that which is applicable to the rate selected by the Client when submitting its Order

(the “Period of Use”). In case of flat-rate or fixed sum payments (monthly, annual or other), and subject to

Article “Conditions Specific to Consumers” and section “Termination for breach”, the Client undertakes to

use the Services during the entire corresponding period. In case of payment per use, the Services are made

available for an indeterminate period of time, and the Client may terminate its use of the Services at any time

in accordance with the procedures in effect.



7.2. Renewal of Services. The terms for the renewal of Services vary from one type of Service to another, as

set out below. Some of these renewed automatically (“Auto-Renew”) while others are renewed upon

payment in advance by the Client. In cases where multiple options exist, the Client is responsible for

selecting the renewal method of its choosing. For certain Services, the Auto-Renew mode is activated by

default. Requests for reissued payment are automatically rejected in case of default in payment or irregular

payment (incorrect amount, incomplete payment, payment which does not include the required references,

or issued using a method or procedure not accepted by OVHcloud). OVHcloud reserves the right to terminate

the renewal, notably, with a reasonable prior notice, in case of a Service’s disappearance.



7.3. Termination for breach. Without prejudice to the other cases of termination provided in the Contract,

and without affecting any other right or remedy available to it, either Party may terminate this Contract with

immediate effect by giving written notice to the other Party if the other Party commits a breach of any term

of this Contract which breach is irremediable or (if such breach is remediable) fails to remedy that breach

within a period of seven 7 calendar days after being notified by registered letter with acknowledgement of

11/18



receipt to do so. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in case of malicious, illegal or fraudulent use of the Services,

or use made in violation of the rights of a third party, OVHcloud shall be entitled to terminate the relevant

Services or the Contract in its entirety with immediate effect by email and without prior formal notice

(provided that, if the Client is a consumer, nothing in this article 7.3 shall affect the Client's rights under

applicable consumer protection law). The present paragraph shall not be considered to be a waiver of

OVHcloud’s right to suspend or interrupt the Services in accordance with the provisions of the Contract,

particularly in case of non-compliance by the Client with the Terms of Service. Terminations for breach are

without prejudice to any damages which may be claimed by the injured party.

professional secrecy or otherwise by a confidentiality agreement, or (b) at the request of a competent legal
