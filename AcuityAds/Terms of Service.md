6.  SECURITY AND AUDIT RIGHTS

AcuityAds shall maintain administrative, physical and technical safeguards for protection of the security, confidentiality and integrity of Personal Data it processes under this DPA. AcuityAds will implement and maintain technical and organizational measures to protect such Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access as described in Appendix 2 (the “Security Measures”). As described in Appendix 2, the Security Measures include measures to encrypt Personal Data; to help ensure ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of AcuityAds’s systems and services; to help restore timely access to Personal Data following an incident; and for regular testing of effectiveness. AcuityAds may update or modify the Security Measures from time to time provided that such updates and modifications do not result in the degradation of the overall security of the Services.

*   Both parties will (taking into account the nature of the processing of Personal Data under this DPA) cooperatively and reasonably assist each other in ensuring compliance with any of each other’s respective obligations with respect to the security of Personal Data and Personal Data breaches under this DPA, including (if applicable) any obligations pursuant to Articles 32 to 34 (inclusive) of the GDPR, by: (a) in the case of AcuityAds, implementing and maintaining the Security Measures in accordance with Appendix 2; and (b) complying with the terms of Section 7 of this DPA.
*   Each Party shall make available to the other Party all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the DPA and each Party may (or if mandated by a Supervisory Authority, will) allow for an audit by a mutually agreeable firm.  To request an audit, the requestor must submit a detailed audit plan at least four (4) weeks in advance of the proposed audit date describing the proposed scope, duration, and start date of the audit. The auditor must be approved in advance by both parties (such approval may not be unreasonably withheld) and execute a written confidentiality agreement acceptable to both parties before conducting the audit. The audit must be conducted during regular business hours, subject to both companies’ policies, and may not unreasonably interfere with either company’s business activities.  Any such audits are at the expense of the party making the request. Both parties agree to share information regarding any non-compliance discovered during the course of an audit.

7.  SECURITY BREACH MANAGEMENT AND NOTIFICATION

*   If either party becomes aware of any accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to any Personal Data transmitted, stored or otherwise Processed on the other party’s equipment or facilities under this DPA (“Security Breach”), such party will promptly notify the other party of the Security Breach. Notifications made pursuant to this section will take place within a reasonable time and certainly no longer than three business days after discovery and shall describe, to the extent possible, details of the Security Breach, including steps taken to mitigate the potential risks and any recommended steps that either or both parties should take to address the Security Breach. Each party will promptly investigate the Personal Data Breach if it occurred on its infrastructure or in another area it is responsible for and will assist the other party as reasonably necessary for both parties to meet their obligations under Data Protection Laws.
*   Both parties agree that an unsuccessful Security Breach attempt will not be subject to this Section 7. An unsuccessful Security Breach attempt is one that results in no unauthorised access to Personal Data processed pursuant to this DPA or to any of either party’s equipment or facilities storing Personal Data, and may include, without limitation, pings and other broadcast attacks on firewalls or edge servers, port scans, unsuccessful log-on attempts, denial of service attacks, or similar incidents.
*   Notification(s) of Security Breaches, if any, will be delivered to one or more of the other party’s business, technical or administrative contacts by any reasonable means, including via email. It is each party’s responsibility to ensure it maintains accurate contact information.
*   Any notification of or response to a Security Breach under this Section 7 will not be construed as an acknowledgement by either party of any fault or liability with respect to the Security Breach.
*   AcuityAds shall implement reasonable technical and organizational Security Measures to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk in respect to the Personal Data. Buyer shall implement security measures at least as stringent as those outlined in Appendix 2. As technical and organisational measures are subject to technological development, either party is entitled to implement alternative measures provided they are at least as protected as those offered by the Security Measures and they do not fall short of the level of data protection set out by Data Protection Law.

8.  RETURN AND DELETION OF PERSONAL DATA

*   Both parties will comply with instructions from the other party to delete certain Personal Data as soon as reasonably practicable and within a maximum period of 90 days, unless Data Protection Law (or, in the case the data is not subject to Data Protection Law, applicable law) requires further storage.
*   On expiry of the Agreement, both parties hereby instruct the other to delete all Personal Data of the other party from their respective systems and discontinue processing of such Personal Data in accordance with Data Protection Law as soon as reasonably practicable and within a maximum period of 90 days, unless Data Protection Law (or, in the case the data is not subject to Data Protection Law, applicable law) requires further storage. This requirement shall not apply to the extent that the Personal Data has been archived on back-up systems so long as such Personal Data is isolated and protected from any further processing except to the extent required by applicable law.

9.  CROSS-BORDER DATA TRANSFERS

*   AcuityAds may, subject to this Section 9, store and process the relevant Personal Data in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, Canada and the United States.
*   Given that Personal Data will be transferred outside of the EEA and/or United Kingdom (the “Transferred Personal Data”) pursuant to this DPA, both parties agree that the Standard Contractual Clauses for Controller to Controller transfers in the form approved by the European Commission and available at [https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries\_en](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en)(as amended or updated from time to time) (“Standard Contractual Clauses”) shall be incorporated by reference and form an integral part of this DPA. Purely for the purposes of the descriptions in the Standard Contractual Clauses and only as between Buyer and AcuityAds, AcuityAds agrees that it is a “data exporter” and Buyer is the “data importer” under the Standard Contractual Clauses. Further, Appendix 1 and 2 of this DPA will take the place of Appendixes 1 and 2 of the Standard Contractual Clauses respectively.
*   If the Standard Contractual Clauses are deemed invalid by a governmental entity with jurisdiction over Transferred Personal Data (e.g., the EU Court of Justice) or if such governmental entity imposes additional rules and/or restrictions regarding such Transferred Personal Data, the parties agree to work in good faith to find an alternative and/or modified approach with respect to such Transferred Personal Data which is in compliance with Data Protection Laws.
*   To the extent Buyer is the recipient of Transferred Personal Data from AcuityAds as part of the Services, Buyer will provide at least the same level of protection for the information as is available under the Standard Contractual Clauses. Buyer recognizes that AcuityAds may share this paragraph 9 with a regulator in order to demonstrate compliance with Applicable Privacy Laws.

10.  LIABILITY

*   Both parties agree that their respective liability under this DPA shall be apportioned according to each parties’ respective responsibility for the harm (if any) caused by each respective party.
*   Liability Cap Exclusions. Nothing in this Section 10 will affect the remaining terms of the Agreement relating to liability (including any specific exclusions from any limitation of liability).

11.  MISCELLANEOUS

*   This DPA will take effect on the date it is executed by Buyer and AcuityAds at the bottom of this Agreement (the “Effective Date”) and will remain in effect until, and automatically expire upon, the deletion of all Personal Data by AcuityAds or Buyer through the Services as described in this DPA.
*   Nothing in this DPA shall impact Buyer’s intellectual property rights with respect to Personal Data provided by Buyer under the Agreement except to the extent required by applicable law.
*   Nothing in this DPA shall confer any benefits or rights on any person or entity other than the parties to this DPA.

Appendix 2 Description of the technical and organizational security measures implemented by the data exporter in accordance with Clauses 4(d) and 5(c) (or document/legislation):

Description of the technical and organizational security measures implemented by the data exporter

_Measures with which Personal Data can be processed while denying physical access to IT systems for unauthorised persons (access control):_

All of the data exporter’s third-party data centers have strict policies for authorization of access into the facilities.   Each data center vendor has appropriate policies required by external audits.  All of the data exporter’s internal personnel are vetted prior to allowing access to data centers.

_Measures to hinder unauthorised persons from using IT systems and procedures (access control):_

All systems level access is based on directory services and role based security.  Additional measures are in place such as VPN and other security measures prior to system level access being available, as described below.  All end user level access to AcuityAds’ systems is based on role based security.  Shared accounts are not allowed.

The data exporter undertakes the following actions, among others, to ensure that persons authorised to use the Acuity Platform or access data processing infrastructure can only access the data underlying their access authorization and that stored data or data undergoing processing cannot be read, copied, altered, or removed without authorization.

The data exporter’s employees access infrastructure components with unique accounts that require strong passwords.  Remote administration is available only via public key cryptography and password based authentication is not permitted.  Access groups have been established to restrict access to only to specific areas that are required for employee responsibilities.

Customers of the data exporter may be granted access to the AcuityAds console. Access to the AcuityAds console is limited via a user name and a password to the customer’s authorised persons and additionally to equivalently authorised employees of the data exporter.  Logical infrastructure configuration prevents the access of one customer’s data by another customer.

_Measures to enable persons authorised to use IT procedures to gain exclusive access to the Personal Data that are subject to their access authorisation (access control):_

The data exporter employs a centralized access management system to control personnel access to production servers, and only provides access to a limited number of authorised personnel. These mechanisms are designed to grant only approved access rights to site hosts, logs, data and configuration information. The data exporter requires the use of unique user IDs, strong passwords; and carefully monitored access lists to minimize the potential for unauthorised account use. The granting or modification of access rights is based on: the authorised personnel’s job responsibilities; job duty requirements necessary to perform authorised tasks; a need to know basis; and must be in accordance with the data exporter’s internal data access policies and training. Approvals are managed by workflow tools that maintain audit records of all changes. Access to systems is logged to create an audit trail for accountability. Where passwords are employed for authentication (e.g., login to workstations), password policies that follow at least industry standard practices are implemented. These standards include password expiry, restrictions on password reuse and sufficient password strength.

In addition, the data exporter has implemented several security related policies that govern the use of AcuityAds technology and data including rules around acceptable use, data classification, information security, and passwords.  The data exporter’s information security officer is Rachel Kapcan.

_Measures to ensure that Personal Data cannot be read, copied, amended or removed by unauthorised persons when the data is transmitted electronically, or when it is being transported, or when it is being stored on data carriers but which allow checks to be made of the destinations targeted when transferring Personal Data using data transmission equipment (routing controls):_

Data is encrypted by measures such as SSL.  Personal data shall not be transferred outside the scope as authorised under these Clauses, or as otherwise authorised by the data importer.

_Measures that allow retrospective checks to be made on whether Personal Data has been entered into, amended or removed from IT systems, and by whom (input controls):_

All data processed in Acuity Platform by an end user of the platform (e.g., CL personnel) is done on a permissions based model, all user accounts are enabled/disabled in accordance with the security policy.  All accounts are individual. Shared accounts are not allowed. Audit Trail is kept for user actions and is logged.

Email and corporate systems access is granted based on directory services and role based security.

_Measures to ensure that Personal Data to be processed on CONTROLLER’s behalf is only processed in accordance with CONTROLLER’s directives (performance controls):_

The data importer is a user of the Acuity Platform, therefore setting up of data collection mechanisms, collection of data, verifying data integrity sit with the data importer. The personal data shall only be processed in the manner authorised under these Clauses and all sub processors shall only be employed in compliance with the provisions of these Clauses.

_Measures to ensure that Personal Data is protected against incidental damage or loss (availability controls):_

Data is kept in a storage framework with at least three copies natively made and stored. Additionally, the data exporter replicates data between data centers for disaster recovery with ability to restore if needed, although the data exporter will not replicate lat/long or other data points which might be considered sensitive in the EU.

_Measures to ensure that the different purposes for processing data can be identified – especially for PROCESSOR’s different controllers – and that data to be processed is processed separately from each other (separation controls):_

AcuityAds stores data in a multi-tenant environment on servers owned by AcuityAds. The Services database and file system architecture are replicated between multiple data centers. AcuityAds logically isolates data on a per end user basis at the application layer. AcuityAds logically separates Customer’s data, including data from different end users, from each other, and data for an authenticated end user will not be displayed to another end user (unless the former end user or administrator allows the data to be shared). A central authentication system is used across all Services to increase uniform security of data.

_Measures to ensure availability and resiliency for data and technical operations:_

AcuityAds stores data and operates servers in datacenters with robust and redundant power and data storage mechanisms. All deployments are configured with repeatable operating templates, for rapid deployment to a DR region when necessary. All networks are protected by network firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and other industry best practice security measures.

_Measures for regular testing, assessment and evaluation:_

AcuityAds regularly reviews system activity rated by security threat level by our intrusion detection platform. AcuityAds regularly runs external network scans to ensure operating systems, libraries, and all used software is patched against vulnerabilities. All platform configurations are catalogued within version control and issued via peer-reviewed pull requests to ensure multiple reviewers of each security related change.

_Measures for pseudonymization of data:_

AcuityAds works with upstream data controllers to ensure no PII enters our system. Any e-mail addresses are hashed prior to ingestion into the platform which would render them as pseudonymous personal data by the time they reach AcuityAds’ systems. Where AcuityAds acts to track activity with cookies, the platform will be disabling inbound traffic to our pixel collection from any IP address that the company determines is coming from the EU.
