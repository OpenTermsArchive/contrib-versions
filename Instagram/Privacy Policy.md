What is the Privacy Policy and what does it cover?

Effective July 26, 2022 | [View printable version](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.instagram.com%2F%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fmbasic.facebook.com%2Fprivacy%2Fpolicy%2Fprintable%2F&e=removed)

We at Meta want you to understand what information we collect, and how we use and share it. That’s why we encourage you to read our Privacy Policy. This helps you use Meta Products in the way that’s right for you.

In the Privacy Policy, we explain how we collect, use, share, retain and transfer information. We also let you know your rights. Each section of the Policy includes helpful examples and simpler language to make our practices easier to understand. We’ve also added links to resources where you can learn more about the privacy topics that interest you.

It's important to us that you know how to control your privacy, so we also show you where you can manage your information in the settings of the Meta Products you use. You can [update these settings](https://help.instagram.com/policy/?link_dialog=PLATFORM_SETTINGS) to shape your experience.

What information do we collect?

The information we collect and process about you depends on how you use our Products. For example, we collect different information if you sell furniture on Marketplace than if you post a reel on Instagram. When you use our Products, we collect some information about you [even if you don't have an account](https://help.instagram.com/policy/?annotations[0]=1.ex.41-InformationWeCollectIf).

Here's the information we collect:

[Your activity and information you provide](https://help.instagram.com/policy/?subpage=1.subpage.1-YourActivityAndInformation)

[Information from Partners, vendors and third parties](https://help.instagram.com/policy/?subpage=1.subpage.4-InformationFromPartnersVendors)

How do we use your information?

We use [information we collect](https://help.instagram.com/policy/?section_id=1-WhatInformationDoWe) to provide a personalized experience to you, including ads, along with the other purposes we explain in detail below.

For some of these purposes, we use information [across our Products](https://help.instagram.com/policy/?annotations[0]=2.ex.5-UsingInformationAcrossOur) and [across your devices](https://help.instagram.com/policy/?annotations[0]=2.ex.1-WhyWeUseInformation). The information we use for these purposes is automatically processed by our systems. But in some cases, we also use [manual review](https://help.instagram.com/policy/?annotations[0]=2.ex.2-ManualReviewExamplesOf) to access and review your information.

To use less information that’s connected to individual users, in some cases we de-identify or aggregate information. We might also anonymize it so that it no longer identifies you. We use this information in the same ways we use your information as described in this section.

Here are the ways we use your information:

To provide, personalize and improve our Products

We use information we have, including any [information with special protections](https://help.instagram.com/policy/?subpage=1.subpage.1-YourActivityAndInformation) you choose to share, to provide and improve our Products.
