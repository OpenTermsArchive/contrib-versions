What information do we collect?

### 

Highlights

The information we collect and process about you depends on how you use our [Products](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?annotations[0]=0.ex.0-WhatProductsDoesThis). For example, we collect different information if you sell furniture on Marketplace than if you ask [AI at Meta](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/genai) to write a joke for you. When you use our Products, we collect some information about you [even if you don't have an account](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?annotations[0]=1.ex.41-InformationWeCollectIf).

Here's the information we collect:

[Your activity and information you provide](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?subpage=1.subpage.1-YourActivityAndInformation)

* * *

[Friends, followers and other connections](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?subpage=1.subpage.2-FriendsFollowersAndOther)

* * *

[Information from partners, vendors and other third parties](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?subpage=1.subpage.4-InformationFromPartnersVendors)

What if you don’t let us collect certain information?

Some information is required for our Products to work. Other information is optional, but without it, the quality of your experience might be affected.

[Learn more](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?annotations[0]=1.ex.43-WhatHappensIfYou)

What if the information we collect doesn’t identify individuals?

In some cases information is de-identified, aggregated, or anonymized by third parties so that it no longer identifies individuals before it’s made available to us. We use this information as described below without trying to re-identify individuals.

### 

Highlights

We use [information we collect](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?section_id=1-WhatInformationDoWe) to provide a personalized experience to you, including ads, along with the other purposes we explain in detail below.

The information we use for these purposes is automatically processed by our systems. But in some cases, we also use [manual review](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?annotations[0]=2.ex.2-ManualReviewExamplesOf) to access and review your information.

To use less information that’s connected to individual users, in some cases we de-identify or aggregate information or anonymize it so that it no longer identifies you. We use this information in the same ways we use your information as described in this section.
