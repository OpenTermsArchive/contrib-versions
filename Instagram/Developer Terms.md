Platform Policy
---------------

Instagram Platform Policy will be updated and incorporated into the new Facebook Platform Terms and Developer Policies, effective August 31, 2020. [Learn More](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2020/07/01/platform-terms-developer-policies).

By using the Instagram Platform, you agree to this policy. By "Platform" we mean a set of APIs, SDKs, plugins, code, specifications, documentation, technology, and services (such as content) that enable others, including application developers and website operators, to retrieve data from Instagram or provide data to us. We reserve the right to change this policy at any time without notice, so please check it regularly. Your continued use of the Instagram Platform constitutes acceptance of any changes. You also agree to and are responsible for ensuring that you comply with the [Instagram Terms of Use](https://www.instagram.com/about/legal/terms/) and [Instagram Community Guidelines](http://help.instagram.com/477434105621119?helpref=page_content).

We provide the Instagram Platform to support several types of apps and services. First, we provide them to help members of our community share their own content with apps or services. We also support apps and services that help brands and advertisers understand and manage their audience, develop their content strategy, and obtain digital rights. Finally, we provide the Instagram Platform to help broadcasters and publishers discover content, get digital rights to media, and share media using web embeds. The Instagram Platform is not intended for other types of apps or services. For those we do support, the following terms and information also apply:

14.  Disclaimer of Any Warranty: Instagram Platform and all data derived through such Platform are provided "as is" with no warranty, express or implied, of any kind and Instagram expressly disclaims any and all warranties and conditions, including but not limited to, any implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, availability, security, title and non-infringement. You are solely responsible for any damage that results from the use of any Instagram Platform and all any data derived through such Platform including, but not limited to, any damage to your computer system or loss of data.
15.  Limitation of Liability: Instagram shall not, under any circumstances, be liable to you for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special or exemplary damages arising out of or in connection with use of the Instagram Platform and any data derived through such Platform, whether based on breach of contract, breach of warranty, tort (including negligence, product liability or otherwise), or any other pecuniary loss, whether or not Instagram has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Under no circumstances shall Instagram be liable to you for any amount.
16.  Release and Waiver: To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you hereby release and waive all claims against Instagram, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, licensors, co-branders or other partners, and employees from any and all liability for claims, damages (actual and/or consequential), costs and expenses (including litigation costs and attorneys' fees) of every kind and nature, arising from or in any way related to your use of the Instagram Platform and data derived through such Platform. If you are a California resident, you waive your rights under California Civil Code 1542, which states, "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor." You understand that any fact relating to any matter covered by this release may be found to be other than now believed to be true and you accept and assume the risk of such possible differences in fact. In addition, you expressly waive and relinquish any and all rights and benefits which you may have under any other state or federal statute or common law principle of similar effect, to the fullest extent permitted by law.
17.  Hold Harmless and Indemnify: To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to hold harmless and indemnify Instagram and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, licensors, co-branders or other partners, and employees from and against any third-party claim arising from or in any way related to your use of the Instagram Platform and any data derived through the Platform, including any liability or expense arising from all claims, losses, damages (actual and/or consequential), suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys' fees, of every kind and nature. Instagram shall use good faith efforts to provide you with written notice of such claim, suit or action.
18.  Relationship of the Parties: Notwithstanding any provision hereof, for all purposes of the Instagram Platform Terms, you and Instagram shall be and act independently and not as partner, joint venturer, agent, employee or employer of the other. You don't have any authority to assume or create any obligation for or on behalf of Instagram, express or implied, and you must not attempt to bind Instagram to any contract.
19.  Invalidity of Specific Terms: If any provision of the Instagram Platform Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision and that the other provisions remain in full force and effect.
20.  No Waiver of Rights by Instagram: Instagram's failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Instagram Platform Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
