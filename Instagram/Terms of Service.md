Welcome to Instagram!  
  
These Terms of Use govern your use of Instagram and provide information about the Instagram Service, outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these terms.  
  
The Instagram Service is one of the [Facebook Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139?ref=igtos), provided to you by Facebook Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Facebook Ireland Limited.  
  

### **The Instagram Service**

We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects (the Service):

*   **Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover, and share.**  
    People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Instagram.
    
*   **Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.**  
    We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the [Data Policy](http://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?helpref=page_content).
    
*   **Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community.**  
    Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
    
*   **Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook Company Products.**  
    Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology, systems, insights, and information-including the information we have about you (learn more in the [Data Policy](http://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?helpref=page_content)) in order to provide services that are better, safer, and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook Company Products that you use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Facebook Company Products.
    
*   **Ensuring a stable global infrastructure for our Service.**  
    To provide our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland Limited, or their affiliates.
    
*   **Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.**  
    We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
    
*   **Research and innovation.**  
    We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community.
    

  

### **The Data Policy**

Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The [Data Policy](http://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?helpref=page_content) explains how we collect, use, and share information across the [Facebook Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139?helpref=page_content). It also explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the [Instagram Privacy and Security Settings](http://help.instagram.com/285881641526716?helpref=page_content).

  

### **Your Commitments**

### **Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree**

**Our Agreement.**

*   Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our [Music Guidelines](https://www.facebook.com/legal/music_guidelines), and your use of our API is subject to our [Platform Policy](https://www.instagram.com/about/legal/terms/api/). If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the [Community Payment Terms](https://www.facebook.com/payments_terms). If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
    
*   If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
    
*   Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.

*   This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
    
*   You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
    
*   Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.
    

**Who Is Responsible if Something Happens.**

*   We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure, and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays, or imperfections. Provided we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful, or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
    
*   The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury, or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
    

**How We Will Handle Disputes.**

> If you are a consumer and habitually reside in a Member State of the European Union, the laws of that Member State will apply to any claim, cause of action, or dispute you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms ("claim"), and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in that Member State that has jurisdiction over the claim. In all other cases, you agree that the claim must be resolved in a competent court in the Republic of Ireland and that Irish law will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions.

**Unsolicited Material.**

> We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.

  

### **Updating These Terms**

We may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account, [here](https://help.instagram.com/370452623149242?ref=igtos).
