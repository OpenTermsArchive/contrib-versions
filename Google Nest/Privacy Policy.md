How can I review and delete my stored video footage?

To review and delete your Nest Cam video history or individual saved clips from your Nest Cam, follow the instructions [here](https://nest.com/support/article/Can-I-delete-my-Nest-Cam-Video-History "here").

Do Nest Hub Max’s camera sensing features ever send video or images from my home to Google?

Yes, but only as part of the Face Match setup process, and not after you’ve completed setup.  

When you set up Face Match on your Nest Hub Max, you use your phone to capture several photos that are combined to create a unique model of your face. These photos are sent to Google, and you can review or delete them at any time by visiting [My Activity](https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity "My Activity"). After this setup process, Face Match will not send any video or images to Google. And with quick gestures, you are not required to send any video or images to Google at all. In addition, we keep the video and images that power these features separate from advertising and don’t use them for ad personalisation.

What’s an example of when my video footage might be shared with third-party apps and services?

One example of this is how we may offer the option to share video clips from Nest Cam with your home security service so that they can help keep your home safe.  

Also, remember that you can use your device’s camera with other Google services (such as uploading a video to YouTube or making a video call with Google Duo) – and when you do this, Google’s [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy "Privacy Policy") will apply.

How can I review and delete my stored audio recordings?

You can review and delete stored audio recordings either via the Nest app (in the case of Nest Cam recordings) or [My Activity](https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity "My Activity") (for interactions with the Google Assistant).

Are my Assistant voice queries used to inform ad personalization?

We keep your audio recordings separate from advertising and don’t use them for ad personalization – but when you interact with your Assistant by voice, we may use the text of those interactions to inform your interests for ad personalization. You can always review your Google settings to [control the ads that you see](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/2662856 "control the ads that you see"), including opting out of ad personalization completely. Learn more about the Google Assistant and the choices available to you [here](https://myaccount.google.com/yourdata/assistant "here").

Why does Google collect environmental and activity-sensor data from my home and how is it used?

Our devices include environmental and activity sensors that detect information about your home’s environment and what’s happening in it, such as motion, whether or not someone is at home, ambient light, temperature and humidity. Data from these sensors, which is regularly sent to Google, serves a variety of purposes, such as helping your home take better care of you, helping us make your devices and services better and keeping you informed. For example:  

• The temperature and humidity sensors in your Nest Learning Thermostat help keep your home comfortable while saving energy  

• Home/Away Assist uses activity sensors across multiple Nest devices in your home to automatically switch the behaviour of Nest devices in your home when you leave and when you come back  

• We used ambient light and temperature sensor data aggregated from thermostats across our customers to determine whether direct sunlight can cause thermostats to think it’s warmer than it actually is, so we introduced [Sunblock](https://nest.com/support/article/What-is-Sunblock "Sunblock"), a new feature, to help your thermostat adjust for this so that it sets the correct temperature  

• We use sensor data to help us troubleshoot and improve the performance, safety and reliability of our devices and services – for example, we use temperature and humidity data from our devices to measure the impact of environmental conditions on battery life  

• We may also use sensor data to keep you informed of updates on Google services, including connected-home services that we think may interest you, such as energy and home safety programmes – but we’ll always respect your choice about whether you want to receive promotional emails from Google  

We do not use environmental and activity-sensor data for ad personalisation. (Remember that to fulfil some requests related to your connected-home devices – for example, “Hey Google, what’s the temperature inside?”– your Assistant can retrieve a sensor reading. Learn more about the Google Assistant and the choices available to you [here](http://myaccount.google.com/yourdata/assistant "here") ).  

When you delete your account, this sensor data is deleted from our servers as explained in our [retention policy](https://policies.google.com/technologies/retention "retention policy").

What’s an example of when my sensor data might be shared with third-party apps and services?

One example of this is how you can choose to share data with utility companies in order to benefit from energy savings programmes and services like [Rush Hour Rewards](https://nest.com/support/article/What-is-Rush-Hour-Rewards "Rush Hour Rewards").

Why is data from my Google Wifi router sent to Google, and how is it used?

Google Wifi collects and uses data as explained [here](https://support.google.com/wifi/answer/6246642 "here"), including information about the types of connected devices that you have and their network usage. The cloud services, Wifi point stats and app stats data described [here](https://support.google.com/wifi/answer/6246642 "here") (which we refer to as Wi-Fi network performance data) is not used for ad personalization. We may use this data to keep you informed about updates on Google services, including connected-home devices and services that we think may help you – such as an additional Wifi point to improve your Internet connectivity. You can opt out from certain portions of this data collection as explained [here](https://support.google.com/wifi/answer/6246642 "here").  

Google Wifi does not track the websites that you visit, nor does it monitor the content of traffic on your Wi-Fi network. Google Wifi sets your default DNS provider to Google Public DNS; more information on what Google Public DNS collects can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/privacy "here"). You can change your DNS provider in the [Advanced Networking settings](https://support.google.com/wifi/answer/6274141 "Advanced Networking settings") of the Google Wifi app at any time.

What’s an example of when my Wi-Fi network performance data might be shared with third-party apps and services?

One example of this is that you may be able to share your Wi-Fi network performance data with your Internet Service Provider so that they can help you troubleshoot your Wi-Fi or Internet-connection issues.
