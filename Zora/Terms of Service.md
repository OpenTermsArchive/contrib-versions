**3\. Access to Our Services**
------------------------------

A blockchain wallet and a third-party wallet, each compatible with our Services (a “**_Wallet_**”), are required to access our Services. Your account on the Services (your “**_Account_**”) will be associated with the blockchain wallet address you use to connect to our Services. By using your third-party wallet in connection with the Services, you agree that you are using that wallet under the terms and conditions of the applicable provider of the wallet. Once your account has been registered, you can add additional information to your profile. Your Wallet address, username (if applicable), and other information you voluntarily add to your profile may be publicly displayed on the Services when you connect your Wallet, and you consent to such public display. For additional information about your account and profile data, please see our Privacy Policy.

Wallets are not operated by, maintained by, or affiliated with Zora, and Zora does not have custody or control over the contents of your wallet and has no ability to retrieve or transfer its contents. Zora accepts no responsibility for, or liability to you, in connection with your use of a wallet and makes no representations or warranties regarding how the Services will operate with any specific wallet. You are solely responsible for keeping your wallet secure and you should never share your wallet credentials or seed phrase with anyone. If you discover an issue related to your wallet, please contact your wallet provider. Likewise, you are solely responsible for your Account and any associated wallet and we are not liable for any acts or omissions by you in connection with your Account or as a result of your Account or wallet being compromised. You agree to immediately notify us if you discover or otherwise suspect any security issues related to the Services or your Account.

You also represent and warrant that you will comply with all applicable laws in connection with using the Services. In order to comply with our legal obligations and keep our users and platform safe, we may need to restrict, suspend, or terminate your access to the Services without prior notice. You acknowledge that we are under no obligation to disclose the details of our decision to take such action with you. 

We may require you to provide additional information and documents in certain circumstances, such as at the request of any government authority, as any applicable law or regulation dictates, to provide you with a requested service, or to investigate a potential violation of these Terms. In such cases, we, in our sole discretion, may disable your Account and block your ability to access the Services until such additional information and documents are processed by Zora. If you do not provide complete and accurate information in response to such a request, we may refuse to restore your access to the Services.

Your access and use of the Services may be interrupted from time to time for any of several reasons, including, without limitation, the malfunction of equipment, periodic updating, maintenance, or repair of the Services, geographic restrictions, potential violation of these Terms, or other actions that we, in our sole discretion, may elect to take. You understand that Zora, in its sole discretion, may disable your Account or restrict access through your Account to our Services.

**4\. Wallets**
---------------

**4.1. Your Wallet**. By connecting a Wallet, including a Privy Wallet (as defined below) to the Services, you agree to abide by the terms and conditions of the applicable Wallet provider. You must familiarize yourself with the terms of use, technology, and security protocols of any Wallet. We do not provide a crypto-wallet service and do not at any time have custody, possession, or control over your crypto assets or any other contents in your Wallet. You acknowledge and agree that we are not party to any transactions conducted while using our Services. We make no representations or warranties regarding how the Services will operate or be compatible with any specific Wallet. The private keys necessary to access the assets held in a Wallet are not held by the Company. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your Wallet, including your credentials, private key, and/or seed phrase. We are in no way liable for any acts or omissions by you in connection with your Wallet or as a result of your Wallet being compromised. You should make contingency plans with respect to your Wallet in the event of your death or incapacity, otherwise you (and your executor, guardian, or heirs) may lose access to your Wallet, your account on the Services, and your crypto assets.

**4.2. Privy Wallet**. If you do not have a Wallet, you can create one using the Services. Zora partners with [Privy](https://www.privy.io/), a third party non-custodial wallet infrastructure provider, to allow users to create a Zora account that includes a self-custodial Wallet that can be accessed via the Services (“Privy Wallet”). By creating or using a Privy Wallet in connection with the Services, you agree that you are using the Privy Wallet under Privy’s terms and conditions available at [https://www.privy.io/terms-of-service](https://www.privy.io/terms-of-service). Only you can sign transactions and access and control your Wallet’s contents. Zora does not have custody, possession, control, or otherwise have access to your Privy Wallet or any assets that may be contained therein, and does not have access to or store any passwords, recovery phrases, private keys, passkeys, or any other credentials associated with user Wallets or your use of the Services. You are solely responsible for securing your Zora account and Privy Wallet authentication credentials, passkeys, and private keys. You can find more information about how Privy Wallets work at https://support.zora.co/en/articles/8637120-how-wallets-created-on-zora-work.

**4.3. Smart Wallet**. If you sign up for the Zora mobile application, your account will include both a Privy Wallet and a smart contract wallet ("Smart Wallet"). Smart Wallets connect all of the Wallets you have linked on Zora  (“Linked Wallets”) into a single unified account to provide you with access to additional features, speed up transactions, and enable a more seamless user experience.  You can use any of your Linked Wallets to access and use your Smart Wallet.  Only you can sign transactions and access and control your Smart Wallet. Your Smart Wallet is not exclusive to Zora, and Zora cannot access your Smart Wallet or any private keys, security phrases, passkeys, or any other credentials associated with your Linked Wallets that provide access to your Smart Wallet. Zora is not in any way responsible for the security of your Smart Wallet credentials. Smart Wallet infrastructure is provided by Coinbase. Learn more about smart wallets at [https://www.smartwallet.dev/why](https://www.smartwallet.dev/why).

**4.4. Assistance**.  If you notice any unauthorized or suspicious activity in Wallets that are related or linked to the Services, please notify us immediately at [support@zora.co](mailto:support@zora.co). However, Zora shall have no duty or obligation to assist you in connection with such activity related to a Wallet, including if you are unable to locate your Wallet credentials.

**5\. Services and the Zora Protocol**
--------------------------------------

**5.1. Token Creation.** The Site allows you to (i) create your own ERC-20 in conjunction with your publication of digital content (in each instance, a “**_Token_**”) to a public blockchain, and (ii) buy and sell Tokens created by you or other users on the Site. All Tokens created on the Site have a fixed supply of 1,000,000,000 units. Each Token on the Site is created by a user by initiating a creation of a smart contract on the applicable public blockchain using the Zora Protocol, an ERC-20 protocol that was developed by Zora and is available alongside the Services (the “**_Zora Protocol_**”). Once a Token is created, its corresponding smart contract cannot be changed by anyone, including the creator of the Token and Zora. The supply and trading dynamics of any Token follow rules of the Uniswap Protocol and the Zora Protocol, which apply to every creator and all Tokens, and is not modifiable by any creator the Token once the Token has been created. Prices of Tokens available on or created using the Services or the Zora Protocol are highly volatile. By using the Services you hereby acknowledge and agree that you understand the risks of interacting with Tokens, including but not limited to those described in Section 16 of these Terms, and are solely responsible for any funds or value resulting from your usage of the Services. The Services provide one method for accessing the Zora Protocol, but are not the only way to do so. For clarity, the defined term “Services” does not include the Zora Protocol.

* **5.1.1. Gas Fees for Creating.** There are no fees paid to Zora for creating your Tokens using the Services. However, transactions on a public blockchain require a fee to cover the computational resources expended to execute the transaction (the “**_Gas Fee_**”). You are responsible for paying the Gas Fee associated with creating a Token through the Services. Gas Fees are necessary to support the applicable public blockchain.
    

**5.2. Network Supportability; Bridging.** 

* **5.2.1. Supported Networks**. The Services may be accessed on the Ethereum blockchain and certain other blockchain networks, including, but not limited to, Base (each, a “**_Supported Network_**”). Tokens created may not be supported or capable of being bridged to any other blockchain network. Subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with these Terms, Zora grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to access and use the Site solely for purposes of creating, buying, or selling Tokens. As Zora lacks the ability to control how a third party may use the Services or the Zora Protocol, nothing in this Section 5 is intended to imply that the Services or the Zora Protocol prohibits a third party from making unauthorized reproduction of any User Content (defined below), and the owner of any intellectual property rights in or associated with a Token is solely responsible for enforcement of such rights.
    

* **5.2.2. Bridging**. Deployments on other blockchain networks typically rely on a series of smart contracts to transfer crypto assets from one blockchain network to another. As a result, before you are able to use the Zora Protocol and the Services via a Supported Network you will be required to “bridge” the crypto assets held within your Wallet on the Ethereum blockchain (or other Supported Network) to the Supported Network that you intend to utilize. This process is known as “**bridging**” and the smart contracts that permit bridging are each known as a “**bridge**.”
    
    If you attempt to attempt to bridge any crypto assets that are not supported by a bridge designed for a Supported Network, you may destroy or irretrievably lose access to such crypto assets. You own, control, and are responsible for all crypto assets held in and bridged via your Wallet and Zora is not liable or responsible for any crypto assets that are destroyed or irretrievably lost by users through the bridging and withdrawing process.
    

**5.3. Peer-to-Peer Nature of Tokens.**  Transactions occurring on the Site are peer-to-peer in nature. As such, Zora is not party to any agreement between any users. You bear full responsibility for verifying the identity, legitimacy, and authenticity of Tokens with which you interact using the Services and we make no claims, guarantees, or recommendations about the identity, legitimacy, functionality, or authenticity of users or any Tokens (and any content associated with such Tokens) visible on the Services. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you release Zora from responsibility, liability, claims, demands, and/or damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown (including claims of negligence), arising out of or related to disputes between users and the acts or omissions of third parties. If you are a consumer who resides in California, you hereby waive your rights under California Civil Code § 1542, which provides: “A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.”

**5.4. Buying and Selling Tokens.** Each transaction on the Site is directly between the buyer and seller of the applicable Token.

* **5.4.1. Platform Fee.**  By using our Services to buy Tokens, you acknowledge and agree that we may collect a fee for providing the infrastructure necessary to complete the transaction. We reserve the right to change our fee at any time, provided that any fees then-applicable to your transaction will be clearly disclosed prior to the completion of such transaction. We urge you to carefully review the applicable fees before entering into any transaction using our Services.
    
* **5.4.2. Disputes Between Users.** Zora will not be a party to any disputes or negotiations of disputes between users. You agree to resolve all such disputes with any other users of the Services directly and without involving Zora in such dispute. Responsibility for the decisions you make regarding Tokens offered via the Services rests solely with you. If Zora is required to participate in any such dispute, then you will indemnify, defend, and hold the Zora Parties (defined below) harmless from and against any and all damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of any such dispute.
    

**5.5. Developing Projects on the Zora Protocol**. The Services provide users with access to certain software development tools located at [https://docs.zora.co/](https://docs.zora.co/) (collectively, “**_Zora Developer Tools_**”), which enable users to build projects that run on the Zora Protocol. Certain portions of the Zora Developer Tools may be available to the public as open-source software, and your use of such Zora Developer Tools is governed by all applicable open-source licenses.

**5.6. Rewards Programs.** Zora, in its sole discretion, may offer your certain incentives and rewards for your use of the Services. In connection with such rewards, you hereby agree that Zora may publish publicly available wallet activity through the Services. The criteria for earning any such rewards will be determined by Zora in its sole discretion, and details regarding rewards programs will be provided on the Services as determined by Zora in its sole discretion. In connection with any rewards programs, you may be required to claim the rewards using your eligible Wallet during the relevant promotional period. If any rewards are not claimed during the promotional period, you understand and agree that such rewards may expire, and you will no longer have any right to claim such rewards. You agree that you are responsible for paying any and all Gas Fees and taxes that may arise out of rewards claimed by you. Zora reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to change, modify, discontinue, or cancel any rewards programs, at any time, without notice to you, and without any liability to you.

**5.7. Supported Crypto Assets and Tokens.**

* **5.7.1. General.** The crypto assets and Tokens supported by the Services are subject to change at our sole discretion and without prior notice. Certain crypto assets or Tokens may be restricted from the Services for any reason, including but not limited to, user harm prevention, legal and regulatory compliance, and enforcement of these Terms. Existing support for any crypto assets or Tokens under the Services does not guarantee any continuous support in the future. You are solely responsible for monitoring which crypto assets or Tokens are supported by the Services. We are not liable for discontinuation of support of any particular crypto asset or Token. We reserve the right to, and by using the services you acknowledge and agree that we may, discontinue supporting any crypto asset or Token with or without notice. Under no circumstances will we be liable for any direct or indirect losses, damages, or costs that you may suffer in connection with any actions or inaction we may take in accordance with these Terms to discontinue our support of a crypto asset or Token.
    
* **5.7.2. Risks.** There are substantial risks associated with transactions involving crypto assets, including ERC-20z Tokens. You should carefully evaluate whether the Services are suitable for you, considering your circumstances, knowledge, and financial resources. While some of these risks are outlined in Section 16 herein, it is not an exhaustive list and may not encompass all risks associated with your use of the Services. By accessing and using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that you assume all risks associated with such actions, and we are not liable for any losses you may incur due to these risks.
    
* **5.7.3. Disclosure.** Support of any crypto asset or Token by the Services does not constitute (i) an offer or solicitation to invest in, buy, or sell any interests or shares, or to participate in any investment or trading strategy, (ii) accounting, legal, or tax advice, or investment recommendations, or (iii) an official statement of Zora. Zora may have financial interests in certain crypto assets or Tokens that are supported by the Services. Prior to making any investment decisions, we advise that you first consult with your advisors.
    
* **5.7.4. No Representation or Warranty.** No representation or warranty is made, expressed, or implied regarding the accuracy of the information or the future performance of any Token, crypto asset, financial instrument, or other market or economic measure. Zora does not endorse or approve any links or third-party websites provided through the Services for the purpose of facilitating user due diligence efforts, or for other educational or informational purposes.
    

**6\. Digital Assets**
----------------------

**6.1. Digital Collectibles.** Zora allows users to create, discover and acquire Tokens on the Services. Through our Services, users can create Tokens on the applicable public blockchain. Zora provides the technical infrastructure for users to create the smart contract on the public blockchain governing each Token created on the Services. Zora does not make any representations or warranties about Third-Party Content (defined below) visible through our Services, including any Content (defined below) associated with any images or Tokens displayed on the Services.

* **6.1.1.** You are solely responsible for the Content associated with any Tokens you create. You represent and warrant that such Content does not contain material subject to copyright, trademark, publicity rights, or other intellectual property rights, unless you have necessary permission or are otherwise legally entitled to post the Content and that the Content does not violate any laws.
    
* **6.1.2.** You are solely responsible for Content related to your Tokens. You bear responsibility for verifying the legitimacy, authenticity, and legality of the Tokens that you purchase from users on our Services. We cannot guarantee that any Tokens visible on our Services will always remain visible and/or available.
    
* **6.1.3.** These Terms solely govern the use of our Services. Tokens are available on public blockchains and may be purchased, sold, or transferred by buyers, sellers, or creators without the use of our Services and therefore without agreeing to our Terms.
    
* **6.1.4.** The value of a Token may increase or decrease on a linear curve based on the engagement by users on the Site. Zora does not control and is not responsible for the value of Tokens and makes no guarantee, express or implied, of its value.
    
* **6.1.5.** You may not use, acquire, sell, or distribute Tokens except through the Services and except as expressly allowed by Zora under these Terms. Any attempt to do so constitutes a violation of the Terms, will render the transaction void, and may result in the immediate suspension or termination of your Account and your loss to your claim to the Token’s value through the Services.
    
* **6.1.6.** Tokens are not legal tender, backed by any government, or subject to protections or insurance provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Securities Investor Protection Corporation. Tokens are not intended to be an investment opportunity of any kind and should not be perceived as one.
    

**6.2. Digital Assets Generally.** TOKENS ARE INTENDED FOR CONSUMER ENJOYMENT, USE AND CONSUMPTION ONLY AND MAY ONLY BE USED FOR THIS INTENDED PURPOSE. THEY ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE A “SECURITY,” AS DEFINED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED, THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940, AS AMENDED, OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY U.S. STATE. YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE NOT ACQUIRING (A) THE TOKENS FOR SPECULATIVE OR INVESTMENT PURPOSES OR (B) AN EQUITY INTEREST OR PROFIT-SHARING INTEREST IN ZORA, ANY CREATOR, OR ANY OTHER INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES ASSOCIATED WITH ZORA. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT LEGISLATION, REGULATION, OR COURT OPINIONS OR ORDERS AT THE STATE, FEDERAL, OR INTERNATIONAL LEVEL MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT YOUR ABILITY TO USE, TRANSFER, OR EXCHANGE THE TOKENS.

**6.3. Transactions.** All transactions are final and, unless otherwise permitted by Zora through its policies or practices, non-refundable and non-reversible. In addition, transaction fees may apply.

**7\. Ownership; Proprietary Rights**

**7.1. Definitions**. For purposes of these Terms, the following definitions apply:

* **7.1.1.** “**_Content_**” means all works of authorship of any kind, including by way of example, text, graphics, images, musical works, sound recordings, software, video, audiovisual, and information or other materials that are posted, provided or otherwise made available through the Services; and
    
* **7.1.2.** “**_Zora Content_**” means the Services, our trademarks, logos, branding, and any other Content that we provide, create, or generate in connection with the Services, including proprietary rights of every kind and nature however denominated throughout the world, registered or unregistered, associated with such Zora Content and the Services.

8\. **User Content.**
------------------------

**8.1. Limited License Grant to Zora.** By submitting, uploading, publishing, storing, broadcasting, or otherwise transmitting (collectively, “**_Posting_**”) Content to or through the Services (“**_User Content_**”), you grant us an unrestricted, assignable, sublicensable, revocable, royalty-free, fully paid-up license throughout the universe to reproduce, distribute, publicly display, communicate to the public, publicly perform (including by means of digital audio transmissions and on a through-to-the-audience basis), make available, create derivative works from, retransmit, and otherwise exploit and use all or any part of such User Content by any means and through any media and formats, whether now known or hereafter developed, for the purposes of: (i) advertising, marketing and promoting Zora, the Services, and the availability of your User Content on the Services; (ii) displaying and sharing your User Content to other users of the Services; and (iii) providing, operating, and improving the Services as authorized by these Terms. All of the rights you grant in these Terms are provided on a through-to-the-audience basis, meaning the owners or operators of external services will not have any separate liability to you or any other third party for User Content Posted or otherwise used on external services via the Services. For clarity, Zora does not claim any ownership of User Content and has no right to use User Content other than in accordance with these terms or otherwise absent your express permission. You agree to pay all monies owing to any person or entity resulting from Posting your User Content and from Zora’s exercise of the license set forth in this Section.

The license contained in this Section does not permit the subject of any photo or their administrators, guardians, heirs, or trustees to sell that image or photograph, whether on a standalone basis or as embodied in any product. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 8.2 only applies to the extent there is not a conflicting agreement between the photographer and the subject(s) of the photo.

**12.7. False Notifications of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notifications**. The Copyright Act provides at 17 U.S.C. § 512(f) that: “\[a\]ny person who knowingly materially misrepresents under \[Section 512 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512)\] (1) that material or activity is infringing, or (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, will be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner’s authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of Zora relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.” Zora reserves the right to seek damages from any party that submits a Notification of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notification in violation of the law.

You represent and warrant that you have done sufficient research before making any decisions to buy, or otherwise interact with any Tokens or accounts/collections.
    
* **16.7.** Zora does not control the public blockchains that you are interacting with, and we do not control certain smart contracts and protocols that may be integral to your ability to complete transactions on these public blockchains.

THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY EVEN IF THE ABOVE STATED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. Some jurisdictions also limit disclaimers or limitations of liability for personal injury from consumer products, so this limitation may not apply to personal injury claims. 

**18\. Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration.**
-------------------------------------------------

**18.1. Generally**. Except as described in Section 18.2 (_Exceptions_) and 18.3 (_Opt-Out_), you and Zora agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms, the Services, or communications from us will be resolved through binding arbitration. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, is less formal than a court proceeding, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. Any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement will be resolved by the arbitrator.

 YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU AND ZORA ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

**18.2. Exceptions**. Although we are agreeing to arbitrate most disputes between us, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.

**18.3. Opt-Out**. If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section 18 (_Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration_) within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by sending a letter to Zora Labs, Inc., Attention: Legal Department – Arbitration Opt-Out, 110 Green Street, #803A, New York, NY 10012, that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your account on the Services, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (“**_Opt-Out Notice_**”). Once Zora receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 18 (_Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration_) will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section 19 (_Governing Law_). The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice.

**18.4. Arbitrator**. This arbitration agreement, and any arbitration between us, is subject the Federal Arbitration Act and will be administered by the JAMS under the rules applicable to consumer disputes (collectively, “**_JAMS Rules_**”) as modified by these Terms. The JAMS Rules and filing forms are available online at [www.jamsadr.org](http://www.jamsadr.org/), by calling the JAMS at +1-800-352-5267 or by contacting Zora.

**18.5. Commencing Arbitration**. Before initiating arbitration, a party must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“**_Notice of Arbitration_**”). Zora’s address for Notice is: Zora Labs, Inc., 110 Green Street, #803A, New York, NY 10012. The Notice of Arbitration must: (i) identify the name or account number of the party making the claim; (ii) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (iii) set forth the specific relief sought (“**_Demand_**”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within thirty (30) days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Zora may commence an arbitration proceeding. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Zora will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than US$10,000 or if Zora has received 25 or more similar demands for arbitration, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the JAMS Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules and the other party may seek reimbursement for any fees paid to JAMS.

**18.6. Arbitration Proceedings**. Any arbitration hearing will take place in the county and state of your residence unless we agree otherwise or, if the claim is for US$10,000 or less (and does not seek injunctive relief), you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a telephonic or video hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the JAMS Rules in the county (or parish) of your residence. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Zora must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.

**18.7. Arbitration Relief**. Except as provided in Section 18.8 (_Class Actions Waiver_), the arbitrator can award any relief that would be available if the claims had been brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by Zora before an arbitrator was selected, Zora will pay to you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator and (ii) US$10,000. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding on all parties, except (1) for judicial review expressly permitted by law or (2) if the arbitrator’s award includes an award of injunctive relief against a party, in which case that party shall have the right to seek judicial review of the injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction that shall not be bound by the arbitrator’s application or conclusions of law. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

**18.8. Class Actions Waiver**. YOU AND ZORA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Zora agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

**18.9. Modifications to this Arbitration Provision**. If Zora makes any substantive change to this arbitration provision, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) days of the change to Zora’s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with Zora will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.

**18.10. Enforceability**. If Section 18.8 (_Class Actions Waiver_) or the entirety of this Section 18 (_Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration_) is found to be unenforceable, or if Zora receives an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section 18 (_Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration_) will be null and void and, in that case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 19 (_Governing Law_) will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.

If any Claim is not subject to arbitration pursuant to Section 18, then the state and federal courts located in the State of Delaware will have exclusive jurisdiction. You and Zora waive any objection to venue in any such courts. If your local law requires that consumer contracts be interpreted subject to local law and enforced in the courts of that jurisdiction, this section may not apply to you only to the extent that local law conflicts with this section.

**APPENDIX A: SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS FOR ZORA NETWORK SERVICES**
------------------------------------------------------------

### **1\. ZORA NETWORK SERVICES OVERVIEW**

The Services allow you to access and interact with the Zora Network, a layer-two optimistic rollup on the Ethereum public blockchain network. The Zora Network is designed to increase transaction throughput, efficiency, and speed by combining multiple transactions into “batches” and settling these transactions to the Ethereum blockchain in compressed format. The Services do not include financial services of any kind, including, without limitation broker, dealer, exchange, investment adviser, or custody services. The Services are technological services that enable you to access and interact with the Zora Network directly. This means that you are solely responsible for the transfer, custody, and management of the crypto assets that you use in connection with the Zora Network.

### **2\. ACCESSING THE ZORA NETWORK THROUGH THE SERVICES**

To access the Zora Network through the Services, you will be required to connect a Wallet to the Services.

### **3\. ZORA NETWORK SERVICES**

**3.1. Distinguishing the Services from the Zora Network**. The Zora Network is a layer-two optimistic rollup on the Ethereum public blockchain that is accessible through the Services.

* **3.1.1** The Zora Network is open-source software built on the OP Stack, the decentralized software stack maintained and approved by the Optimism Collective, and comprises a set of smart contracts, which, once deployed, are not controlled by Zora. The OP Stack is available to the public at [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism).
    
* **3.1.2.** Although Zora initially deployed the Zora Network software, Zora does not operate the Zora Network itself. The Zora Network is distinct from the Services and is not offered or provided by Zora, either as a part or component of the Services or otherwise.
    
* **3.1.3.** There is a risk that the Optimism Collective may approve a network upgrade that, if implemented, may introduce bugs, viruses, Trojan horses, or other vulnerabilities or changes to the Zora Network that could result in a partial or complete disruption of the Zora Network or loss, damage, or destruction of your crypto assets.
    
* **3.1.4.** At no point in time will Zora or the Zora Network (whether via any bridge, Sequencer, or otherwise) take custody, possession, or control over your crypto assets.
    

**3.2. Bridging and Withdrawing**.

* **3.2.1.** Before you are able to transact through the Zora Network, you will be required to bridge crypto assets held within your Wallet on the Ethereum blockchain to the Zora Network so that you can transact with such crypto assets. Crypto assets that have not been bridged to the Zora Network cannot be used in transactions on the Zora Network. Similarly, crypto assets that have been bridged to the Zora Network cannot be used in transactions on the Ethereum blockchain until such crypto assets have been withdrawn from the Zora Network. The crypto assets that you bridge to the Zora Network will appear in your Wallet on the Zora Network, but will not appear in your Wallet on the Ethereum blockchain. The crypto assets that you withdraw will no longer appear in your Wallet on the Zora Network but will appear in your Wallet on Ethereum.
    
* **3.2.2.** The Zora Network’s native bridge (the “**_Zora Bridge_**”) permits users to bridge ether and other ERC-20 Tokens to the Zora Network. Do not use the Zora Bridge to attempt to bridge any crypto assets that are not supported by the Zora Bridge. For more information about Third-Party Bridges, see Section 3.7.2 of this Appendix.
    
* **3.2.3.** You always own, control, and are responsible for all crypto assets that you bridge or attempt to bridge to the Zora Network via any bridge. Zora is not liable or responsible for any crypto assets that are destroyed or irretrievably lost in connection with your use of any Zora Network bridge, including the Zora Bridge.
    

**3.3. Verifier**. You may choose to serve as a “verifier” on the Zora Network (“**_Verifier_**”) by operating the necessary hardware and open-source software to verify transactions on layer-two optimistic rollups on the Ethereum blockchain. Verifiers may monitor for discrepancies (or “faults”) between the transaction history and state of the Zora Network to protect against any loss of crypto assets as a result of a failure of the Zora Network technology. You are responsible for maintaining all hardware and software necessary to serve as a Verifier.

**3.4. Sequencer**. As a layer-two optimistic rollup on the Ethereum public blockchain network, the Zora Network will combine multiple transactions into “batches” and settle these transactions to the Ethereum blockchain in a compressed format via a component of the Zora Network known as a “sequencer” (the “**_Sequencer_**”).

* **3.4.1.** Once a transaction has been executed on the Zora Network, the Sequencer will programmatically organize the transaction within a batch of transactions, compress the batched transaction data, and submit such data to a series of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain every sixty (60) minutes. This process is intended, among other things, to result in transactions on the Zora Network requiring lower aggregate transaction fees or “gas” than typical Ethereum blockchain transactions while immutably memorializing such transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.
    
* **3.4.2.**You have the option to avoid using the Sequencer by submitting your transactions directly to the Canonical Transaction Chain via a Cross Chain Messenger smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. Your ability to directly submit transactions is intended to offer you other means of performing transactions via the Zora Network.
    
* **3.4.3.**You understand that any transactions submitted directly to the Canonical Transaction Chain via a Cross Chain Messenger smart contract may require more transaction fees because in such circumstances transaction fees or “gas” will be borne solely by you as opposed to being amortized among the users that have their transactions “batched” in the Sequencer.
    
* **3.4.4.**You further understand that ConduitXYZ, Inc. (the “**_Service Provider_**”) is responsible for the administrative task of operating the Sequencer.
    

**3.5. Waiting Periods**.

* **3.5.1.**Withdrawing transactions on the Zora Network will be considered “pending” until the end of a seven-day “dispute period” (the “**_Dispute Period_**”), and will only be deemed final at the conclusion of the Dispute Period. As a result, withdrawing your crypto assets from the Zora Network may result in you not being able to immediately access or use the crypto assets that are being withdrawn until the Dispute Period ends.
    
* **3.5.2.** During the Dispute Period, the Zora Network is designed to allow you to initiate a “force-withdraw” as of the last valid state of the Zora Network, subject to Zora Network Dispute Period requirements. Initiating a force-withdraw allows you to manually withdraw your ether or ERC-20 Tokens from the Zora Network if you suspect any discrepancy or a faulty state of the Zora Network. This function is native to the OP Stack (and Zora Network) and allows you to unlock your crypto assets based on the then-current state of the Zora Network, subject to Zora Network Dispute Period requirements. Assets on the Zora Network are not currently capable of being force-withdrawn, and you acknowledge and agree that Zora is not responsible for any losses that may result from any attempt by you to force-withdraw crypto assets from the Zora Network.
    

**3.6. Zora Network Transaction Fees**. The Zora Network will charge you a transaction fee or “gas” on each transaction that you initiate on the Zora Network. You are responsible for any and all gas fees that are charged to your Wallet as a result of your transactions on the Zora Network.

* **3.6.1**You understand that there is a risk that transactions fees may be charged to your Wallet as a result of a failed or incomplete transaction. You acknowledge and agree that you assume full responsibility for any such transactions fees that are charged to your Wallet in connection with a failed or incomplete transaction.
    

**3.7. Third-Party Products**.

* **3.7.1. Developer Tools**. The Services provide users with access to certain Zora Development Tools, which allow users to connect to the Zora Network and the Zora Network’s block explorer. Certain portions of the Zora Developer Tools may be available to the public as open-source software, and your use of such Zora Developer Tools is governed by all applicable open-source licenses.
    
* **3.7.2. Third-Party Bridges**. Third-party developers may release third-party bridges that allow users to bridge crypto assets, including crypto assets not supported by the Zora Bridge, from the Ethereum blockchain to the Zora Network (“**_Third-Party Bridges_**”). Third-Party Bridges may allow you to access your crypto assets at a faster rate than the Zora Bridge as Third-Party Bridges may offer different deposit and withdraw times. Third-Party Bridges may also charge you additional or different transaction or “gas” fees than the Zora Bridge. You must exercise caution when accessing and using Third-Party Bridges. Once your crypto assets are locked in a Third-Party Bridge, control over such Third-Party Bridge is typically with the third-party developer or the smart contract itself. At no point in time will Zora or the Service Provider be liable to you for any loss involving a Third-Party Bridge, have the ability to exercise control over any Third Party Bridge or assist you if your crypto assets get locked in a Third-Party Bridge. The applicable service provider for the Third-Party Bridge is solely responsible for the crypto assets you use in connection with a Third-Party Bridge and any transaction that is facilitated via such Third-Party Bridge whether successful, incomplete, subject to dispute, or otherwise
    
* **3.7.3. Warning**. Zora does not make any representation or warranty or approve of your use of any Third-Party Bridges software or other products (collectively, “**_Third-Party Products_**”) as such products are developed independent of Zora by third parties. Zora does not and will never assume responsibility for any of the Third-Party Products or the losses or damages that may result therefrom. Your use of any Third-Party Products is at your own risk and expense and subject to the terms and conditions of any such Third-Party Product. Prior to your use or access of any Third-Party Products, please carefully review the terms of conditions related to the Third-Party Product.  
    

### **4\. PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES**

You understand that you are responsible for all conduct and activities associated with your Wallet that occur on the Zora Network in connection with your use of the Services. As a result, you agree that you will not engage in any of the following activities through the Services: (i) circumvent or attempt to circumvent any limitations or restrictions placed on network access of the Services and/or Zora Network; (ii) use the Services and/or Zora Network in a manner that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect, or inhibit other users from enjoying the Services and/or Zora Network, or that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the functioning of the Services and/or Zora Network; (iii) develop, attempt to develop, deploy, or attempt to deploy any software or technology that could harm or negatively affect the Services and/or Zora Network, or which should be reasonably likely to harm or negatively affect the Services and/or Zora Network; (iv) reverse engineer any aspect of the Services and/or Zora Network, or engage in any activities that are intended or might discover the Services and/or Zora Network’s source code, (v) use the Services and/or Zora Network to carry out or facilitate any illegal activities, including but not limited to, money laundering and terrorist financing; (vi) use the Services and/or Zora Network to engage in “front-running,” “wash trading,” “pump and dump” trading, "rug pulls" and similar scams, or other activities that are meant to, or are reasonably likely to, deceive or manipulate trading activities or harm other users; or (vii) use the Services and/or Zora Network to participate in any financial activities that are subject to registration, licensing, or similar regulatory approvals.

### **5\. ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS**

Pursuant to Section 2.1 of the Terms, persons subject to economic and trade sanctions and/or located in a jurisdiction subject to economic and trade sanctions, among others, are not eligible to access or use the Services. Additionally, the Zora Network is designed to programmatically restrict persons subject to economic and trade sanctions and/or located in a jurisdiction subject to economic and trade sanctions from accessing the Zora Network.
