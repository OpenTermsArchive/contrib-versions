You acknowledge and agree that these Terms are a binding agreement between you and Foursquare, and which Foursquare is required to pass onto you by Apple: (a) these Terms are between you and Foursquare only, and not with Apple, and Foursquare is solely responsible for the iOS Apps and the content thereof; (b) there are additional usage rules for the iOS Apps by Apple, which are subject to additional restrictions set forth in the App Store Terms of Service (the “Usage Rules”) and you will comply with such Usage Rules; (c) Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the iOS Apps; (d) to the extent permitted by law, Apple shall have no warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the IOS Apps or any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure of the iOS Apps; (e) Foursquare, not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims that you may have or any third party relating to the iOS Apps, your possession and/or use of the iOS App, including but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the Software fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; (iii) claims arising under consumer protection, privacy, or similar legislation; and (iv) claims that the iOS Apps infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights; (f) Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of these Terms, and Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third party beneficiary thereof).

### Integration and Severability.

These Terms of Use are the entire agreement between you and Foursquare with respect to the Service and use of the Site, Service, Content, User Submissions or Save-to-Link, and supercede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and Foursquare with respect to ourSites. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms of Use will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. Waiver of compliance in any particular instance does not mean that we will waive compliance in the future. In order for any waiver of compliance with these Terms of Use to be binding, Foursquare must provide you with written notice of such waiver through one of its authorized representatives.

### Modification of Terms of Use.

Foursquare reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace any of these Terms of Use, or change, suspend, or discontinue the Services (including without limitation, the availability of any feature, database, or content) at any time by posting a notice on our Sites or by sending you notice through the Services or via email. Foursquare may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Services without notice or liability. It is your responsibility to check these Terms of Use periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Services following the posting of any changes to these Terms of Use constitutes acceptance of those changes.

### Cancellation of these Terms of Use

In respect of users located in the EEA who wish to receive Services, and/or provide User Submissions, and/or provide or access Content via our Sites, such users may have a right to cancel these Terms of Use under the European Distance Selling Directive (97/7/EC) ("Directive") within 7 days of accepting these Terms of Use solely to the extent such right applies under the Directive to such users, save that if such right to cancel applies, it shall cease to exist from the time of actual use of the Services, and/or provision of the User Submissions, and/or provision or access of Content via the Sites by such users.

### Miscellaneous.

Foursquare shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond Foursquare's reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation (including "line-noise" interference). These Terms of Use are personal to you, and are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with Foursquare's prior written consent. Foursquare may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights and obligations hereunder without consent. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of these Terms of Use and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect.

Unless otherwise specified in these Terms of Use, all notices under these Terms of Use will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or email; or the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service.

Solely in respect of users located in the EEA, in respect of these Terms of Use and your use of our Sites, Services, Content, User Submissions or Save-to Link, nothing in these Terms of Use shall be deemed to grant any rights or benefits to any person, other than us and you (and our and your respective successors in title or assignees), or entitle any third party to enforce any provision hereof, and we and you agree that we do not intend that any provision of these Terms of Use should be enforceable by a third party by virtue of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.

### Language.

Where Foursquare has provided you with a translation of the English language version of these Terms of Use, then you agree that the translation is provided for your convenience only and that the English language versions of the Terms will govern your relationship with Foursquare.

If there is any contradiction between what the English language version of these Terms of Use says and what a translation says, then the English language version shall take precedence.
