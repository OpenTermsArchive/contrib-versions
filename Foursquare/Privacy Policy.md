Foursquare Labs, Inc. Privacy Policy

Foursquare Labs, Inc. ("Foursquare") knows that you take your privacy seriously. We do, too. We are committed to giving you transparency of our privacy practices and control over your data in connection with Foursquare's Service (as defined in Foursquare's Terms of Service). To that end, in addition to this Privacy Policy, we have developed the following other documents that complement and are part of this policy, all of which describe the data we collect, how we use it, with whom we share it, and your choices regarding your data:

*   A 'Privacy 101’ page, a concise and easy to read way to learn about privacy on Foursquare® and the guiding principles that inform how we develop Foursquare and the decisions we make. and
*   A set of FAQs related to privacy.

This Privacy Policy covers Foursquare's treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") and other data that Foursquare gathers when you are accessing Foursquare's Service. The Service is not available to individuals who are younger than 13 years old.

What Personal Information Does Foursquare Collect?

*   Personal Information You Provide to Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our Service or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected may include your name, email address, phone number, birthday, Twitter and/or Facebook usernames, use information regarding your use of our Service, and browser information. We automatically receive your location when you use the Service. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as allowing you to set up a user account and profile that can be used to interact with other users through the Service, improving the content of the Service, customizing the advertising and content you and your friends see, and communicating with you about specials and new features. We may also draw upon this Personal Information in order to adapt the Services of our community to your needs, to research the effectiveness of our network and Services, and to develop new tools for the community.
*   Information Collected Automatically: When you use the Service, Foursquare automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser or mobile platform, including your location, IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested. We treat this data as non-Personal Information, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. Unless otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, Foursquare only uses this data in aggregate form. We may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our Service, so that our partners may also understand how often people use their services and our Service.
*   Information We Receive from Third Parties: We receive and store information from third parties that interact in some way with the Service or that provide services to us in connection with the Service. For example, if you unlock a Foursquare special that is redeemed through a credit card swipe, the credit card processor may tell us information about the redemption such as the time that your card was swiped. In addition, you may choose to use apps that share your Personal Information, activities and/or content with Foursquare. Please read the privacy policy of any such app so that you understand its sharing practices.

How is My Information Shared?

Personal Information about our users is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone, though, as described more fully in this section below (under "Publicly Available Information, the Foursquare API, and Apps"), your publicly-available information is available to third parties, and we may provide it to third parties, by license or otherwise. The default user settings for all data about you that is visible to others is summarized in our Privacy FAQs, together with information on how to change the default user settings or how to generally remove information, where applicable. Foursquare may share your Personal Information only as described in this Privacy Policy and related documents.

*   Friends: Your friends can see, for example, the location and time of each of your check-ins, name, email, phone number, photo, hometown, mayorships and badges, links to your Twitter and Facebook accounts (if you have connected those accounts to your Foursquare account), a list of your friends, and tips you write. Individuals reading this information may use it or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge. We therefore urge you to think carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in comments or tips or other content (location or otherwise) that you create in the Service.
*   Businesses, Locations, Events and Brands: One of the key purposes of Foursquare is to help users learn about businesses, locations, events and brands (for example, a TV show, a TV personality, newspaper or a consumer good that manages a page on the Service) that are relevant to them, and for these entities to provide information about themselves, their locations and events to users, as well as to reward users when they visit their location or event through offers and specials. When you check-in to a particular location that is a ‘claimed location’ your check-ins are shared with that location in order for it to better provide services to you. Additionally, brands may have access to aggregated and anonymous data, such as anonymized check-in data (that is, not tied to individual users) of users that like their brand. For more info read the Privacy FAQs.
*   Publicly Available Information, the Foursquare API, and Apps: When you use Foursquare, certain information is public, such as your public user profile information, tips, likes, public photos, lists that you create and lists of friends, and may be searchable by search engines and be shared with or disclosed to third parties, including through our API to a wide range of users and services.  We may also share or disclose aggregated and anonymous data, such as anonymized check-in data (that is, not tied to individual users), to third parties, including users of our API, for analytical or other purposes. 

In addition, use of third party apps developed using our API are subject to the terms of use and privacy policies of such third party developers. Certain Personal Information may be made available to third party developers if you or your "friends" use these third party apps. You should review the policies of third party apps and websites to ensure that you are comfortable with the ways in which they use and disclose the information you share with them. We do not guarantee that they will follow our rules or our Privacy Policy. Note that your friends will also be able to see which third party apps that you use.

*   Agents: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Our agents do not have any right to use Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us, and they provide a comparable level of protection for your Personal Information.

Determining and Sharing Location

Foursquare deals with location, so in order to work, Foursquare needs to know your location. Whenever you open and use/interact with the Foursquare app on your mobile device or go to Foursquare.com, we use the location information from your mobile device or browser (e.g., latitude and longitude) to tailor the Foursquare experience to your current location (i.e., we’ll show you a list of nearby locations, friends and tips). This information is NOT shared with others. Also, Foursquare uses your mobile device’s ‘background location’ (formerly known as ‘Radar’) to provide the service, including to send you notifications of tips/friends/interesting things etc. near you. If you have ‘background location’ turned on, the Foursquare app will, from time to time, tell us about your device’s location even if you are not directly interacting with the application.

Your location data is ONLY shared with others when you proactively decide to "check in" to tell Foursquare you’re at a particular place or, if you have turned on ‘check-in by friends,’ when your friend mentions you in his or her check in. The location information shared with a "check in" is the location information of that place. Each of your Foursquare check-ins is saved to your "Check-in History," which allows you to look back at all the locations you have checked in since you created your Foursquare account. You can delete any or all of your check-ins from the check-in details page on the Foursquare website and Foursquare app. If for some reason you ever decide to delete your Foursquare account, your entire check-in history will be removed from our database.

Sometimes you’ll want to check in without sharing your specific whereabouts with friends. This is why we created "Private check-ins" -- a way of adding locations to your check-in history, earning points and adding to your badge counts, while maintaining complete privacy (even from friends). We find this comes in handy on dates, dinners with parents, or at a coffee shop when you’re just trying to get some work done - really anywhere where you don’t want friends to drop in. To check-in "privately", simply select "No" on the "Share this check-in with friends" option seen on every "check-in" screen across our mobile apps. As noted above (under "Publicly Available Information, Apps, and The Foursquare API"), while your private check-ins will not be visible to the public or your friends, we may share the fact that such check-in has occurred in an anonymous manner.

Foursquare Features

The Foursquare service includes several features that may allow you to share your information with others. For each of these and our other features, the information available to friends and others, our default user settings, and how to alter the default settings, is available in the Privacy FAQs. Please review them carefully. Please remember that if you choose to provide personal information using certain features of the Service, that information may be available to the wider Foursquare community, or may be published on the Foursquare website, which is subject to indexing by third party search engines.

Sharing with Partners, in connection with business transfers, and for the protection of Foursquare and others:

*   Our Partners: In addition to the data sharing described above, we enter into relationships with a variety of businesses and work closely with them. In certain situations, these businesses, provide services to you, sell items or provide promotions to you through Foursquare's Service. In other situations, Foursquare provides services, or sells products jointly with these businesses. You can easily recognize when one of these businesses is associated with your transaction, and we will share your Personal Information that is related to such transactions with that business.
*   Business Transfers: If Foursquare or substantially all of its assets are acquired, or in the unlikely event that Foursquare goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.
*   Protection of Foursquare and Others: We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law, including laws outside your country of residence. enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements. or protect the rights, property, or safety of Foursquare, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations (including outside of your country of residence) for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
