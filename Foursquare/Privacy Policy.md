Foursquare Consumer Services Privacy Policy
-------------------------------------------

Foursquare knows that you take your privacy seriously. We do, too. We seek to be transparent about our data practices and give you control over the information we collect about you. This Consumer Services Privacy Policy covers Foursquare Labs, Inc. and its affiliates and subsidiaries, Placed, LLC, Factual Inc., Foursquare Labs UK Limited, Factual Limited (UK), Foursquare Labs Asia Pte. Ltd., Factual Private Limited, Factual KK, and Factual Pty Ltd (collectively, “Foursquare”, “we”, “us”, or “our”). For a list of our office addresses, please see [here](https://foursquare.com/legal/addresses).

The Consumer Services include our websites (the “Sites”), our mobile applications (the “Apps”), and other online services that we own or control (collectively, the “Consumer Services”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to our Enterprise Services or information related to our enterprise customers, business partners or data suppliers. Please see our Enterprise Services Privacy Policy for details about our information practices related to those business services.

This Policy also describes applicable data protection rights including a right to object to some of our processing.

To read our entire policy, see below.

#### 1\. What Data Does Foursquare Collect

Data You Provide To Us:

We collect data that you provide to us when you create an account, such as full name, email address, phone number, birthday, gender, the city in which you created your account, and, where applicable, your social media username and other data if you create an account using third party log-in credentials (please see “Data Received From Third Parties” below).

We may also collect other data you provide when you use the Consumer Services, including pictures you upload, messages you send through the Apps, searches, likes, follows, check-ins, tips, survey responses, demographic information, and any other data that you voluntarily provide to us.

Data Collected Automatically When You Use Our Consumer Services:

If you opt in to sharing your location with us, we automatically receive data about your precise location (e.g., latitude-longitude coordinates) whenever you use the Consumer Services (e.g. open our mobile apps, visit our website, etc.). If you opt in to have background location on in our Apps, we will collect data about your location when you are not using the Apps and when the Apps are closed (as permitted by your device settings).

We also collect additional data about you when you use the Consumer Services. For example:

*   data about how you interact with the Consumer Services, such as your search words, page views, date and time of interactions, time spent on each page, or posts you make;
*   device information, such as your hardware model, operating system and version, unique ID and device data such as device identifiers, IP address, sensor data, browser type, language, and wireless network, mobile device name, types of mobile apps installed; and
*   data from cookies, pixels and other technologies, such as cookie ID, advertising ID or other unique advertising ID, web beacons, and local storage. You can control certain types of cookies through your browser settings or other tools.

You may review our [Cookie Policy](https://foursquare.com/legal/cookiepolicy) for further information.

Data Received From Third Parties

We may receive data about you from third parties, including:

*   our Enterprise Customers (e.g. business customers of our Products);
*   third parties that provide services to us, such as unaffiliated apps and websites, offered by our business partners, including those from whom we license data; and

The information we obtain from third parties includes demographic data, data about how you interact with the third party's websites and apps, device data (including mobile device and advertising identifiers, such as Apple IDFA or Google Advertising ID), and information from cookies, pixels and other similar technologies. In the event that we obtain data about you from our Enterprise Customers and third parties, we will combine all data collected about you into one single profile.

#### 2\. How Is My Data Used By Foursquare?

To Operate, Maintain and Improve The Consumer Services

We use your data to operate, maintain the Consumer Services, and our business, and to understand you better and personalize the Consumer Services. To do so, when you download more than one App, we combine your data that we obtain in each App. In addition, if you use the Consumer Services when you are not logged into your Foursquare account, when you subsequently log in to your Foursquare account, we combine data collected while you were not logged in.

Some features and functionality in our Apps require that you provide your location. If you have location services turned on, whenever you use our Apps on your mobile device, we collect and use your geocoordinates (e.g. latitude and longitude) to tailor the Consumer Services to your current location. We will only process your location with your express permission. If you have persistent background location turned on, we will obtain your device’s location even if you are not using the Apps. Your location is never shared with others, except with your consent or as permitted under this Privacy Policy.

We use various technologies to determine your precise location, such as the location services of your operating system or browser, sensor data from your device (e.g. magnetometer, barometer, gyroscopes, accelerometers, compasses, Bluetooth data, beacon data, Wi-Fi access points, GPS data, and cell tower data), and other data that may help us understand your precise location.

If you have opted-in to sharing your background location with us in our Apps, you may remove your permission at any time by going into your operating device settings and toggling off background sharing.

We also use your data to improve the Consumer Services and our business, conduct research and development, perform analytics, develop and offer new products and service, and to infer certain details about you, including details about you, your interests and whether separate devices (e.g. mobile phones, tablets, and/or TVs) are owned by you or by members of your household. For example, we may customize the Consumer Services to allow you to add friends from your device’s contact list who are also using the Consumer Services or, if applicable, your Facebook, Google or Twitter account, if you have opted to connect these accounts to your Foursquare accounts). We do not store your contact lists. As another example, we also use your data to help us map Locations (as defined below). For example, we may use device signals to determine that a particular device is within a particular venue. Additionally, if you consent to sharing crash data (when the Apps crash) with us, we may use that data to help us analyze the cause of the crash and improve the Consumer Services.

Communicate With You

We use your data to communicate with you by email, text (if you opt-in), or in our Apps, about new product offerings, updates to the Consumer Services, or anything else we think may be of interest to you. To opt out of receiving marketing communications, please see the “Unsubscribe from Marketing Emails and Text Messages” section of this Privacy Policy below.

Rewards, Contests and Sweepstakes

We may use your data, including your completed surveys, to enable you to earn points and administer your participation in contests and sweepstakes. If you enter a sweepstakes, we will use certain information associated with your account, such as your name and email address, to run the sweepstakes and fulfill prizes to you.

Protection of Our Rights

We may use your data to protect the rights, property or safety of Foursquare, the Consumer Services, our users and employees, or any third party. For example, we may use your data to protect against identity theft, prevent fraud or other criminal activity, claims or other liabilities. We may also use your data to comply with and enforce applicable legal requirements, relevant industry standards and our policies, including this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service.

Our Products

We use your data in our business products and services (“Products”) that we offer to our partners. In particular, we receive data from unaffiliated apps and websites, online advertising services, and our partners, which we may use to send you advertisements that are tailored to your interests. The data collected for this purpose includes data about how you interact with the Consumer Services or with unaffiliated websites and apps, device data, and data from cookies, pixels or other similar technologies.

We combine the data described above with demographic data, location and other interest-based segment data obtained from third parties, including data obtained from the Enterprise Services to provide our Products.

#### 3\. When Is My Data Shared?

We may share certain data about you as further described in this Consumer Services Privacy Policy or when you have given us consent to do so.

Data That May Be Shared With Other Users

When you use the Foursquare Apps and Sites, your authorized friends may see some of your data (e.g. name, profile photo, hometown, users you are following, your followers, and other information you post). When you communicate using the Foursquare Apps and Sites, such as when you direct message your friends or check-in to a store, restaurant or a location (each a “Location”), your friends may see this data. You can always control what you want visible to others, including your friends, in your “Settings”.

Publicly available data includes your public profile, tips, likes, saves, photos, lists you create and follow, badges/stickers, mayorships, and lists of followers. Public data may be searchable by search engines and be shared with third parties, including through our Products.

Data That May Be Shared With Affiliates, Service Providers and Partners

We may share your data with our affiliated entities, and service providers that perform services on our behalf, such as cloud storage, IT services, marketing, analytics and search engine and other software services. These service providers may be located in countries other than the country in which the information originally was collected, such as the United States and Canada. We do not authorize our service providers to retain, use or disclose the data except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements.

In addition, when we partner with a business, we may share your mobile advertising identifier or another identifier, and other data such as inferred visits to public locations (such as a store or a restaurant) or as a part of a chain of inferred visits (such as this device went to John’s Coffee Store, then Sarah’s Yoga Studio, and then after, Jenny’s Juice Bar). We do not share your latitude and longitude coordinates, and we do not share inferred home and work location. Data is only shared after it has been processed into an inferred visit to a public location. We may also assist our business partners in combining the data we obtain when you use the Consumer Services with the data we receive from those business partners about online or offline advertisements that you may have viewed (including on unaffiliated apps, websites, and billboards). We do this so that our partners can serve targeted ads, measure the effectiveness of their ad campaign, perform analytics and/or understand you better based on preferences that we infer about you. We may also share data to our developer community or third parties for analytical or other purposes.

Data That May Be Shared With Our Affiliates and Subsidiaries

We may share data with our affiliates and subsidiaries in order to improve the Consumer Services, develop and offer our Products, and for other purposes.

Compliance with Law, Protection of Rights and Corporate Events

We may share data (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process (such as a court order or subpoena); (ii) in response to requests by government agencies, such as law enforcement authorities; (iii) to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights; (iv) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical or other harm or financial loss; (v) in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity; or (vi) to protect the rights, property, or safety of Foursquare and our products and services, our employees, or users and others.

We may also share data as part or in anticipation of a business sale, merger, consolidation, investment, change in control, transfer of substantial corporate assets, reorganization, liquidation, or similar business transaction or corporate event.

When You Consent

We will also share your data with your consent.

#### 4\. What About Cookies and Similar Technologies?

We may use technologies like cookies, pixels, web beacons, local storage and other automated technologies on our Sites, in our emails, within our Apps, and sometimes in third party apps that use our APIs or SDKs to provide you with a range of products and services. We use these technologies for a number of purposes, such as for authentication, security, preference settings, in our Products for advertising, measurement and analytics.

You can control cookies through your browser settings and other tools. If you reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of the Consumer Services. For more information, including the types of cookies and similar technologies found on Foursquare, please read our [Cookie Policy](https://foursquare.com/legal/cookiepolicy).

Third-Party Analytics

On our Consumer Services, we use third-party analytics services, such as those of Google Analytics. The service providers that administer these analytics services use cookies and other automated technologies to collect data (such as IP addresses and other device identifiers) to evaluate, for example, use of our Consumer Services and to diagnose technical issues. To learn more about Google Analytics, please visit https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.

Interest-Based Advertising

Through our Consumer Services, both we and certain third parties (such as our business partners) may collect information about your online activities to provide you with advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests. You may see our ads on other websites or mobile apps because we use third-party ad services. Through such ad services, we can target our messaging to users considering demographic data, users’ inferred interests and browsing context. These services track users’ online activities over time and across multiple online services by collecting information through automated means, including through the use cookies, web server logs, web beacons, device identifiers and other similar technologies. The ad services use this information to show ads that may be tailored to users’ interests. The information ad services may collect includes data about users’ visits to our Consumer Services and other websites and apps that participate in the relevant ad services, such as the pages or ads viewed and the actions taken on the websites or apps. This data collection takes place both on our Consumer Services and on unaffiliated third-party websites and apps that participate in these ad services. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.

#### 10\. U.S. Consumer Rights and Disclosures

U.S. Opt Out

In the United States, the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") and the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") have established rules about interest-based advertising including cross-device linking for such advertising. Interest based advertising is a digital advertising that is tailored to a consumer's inferred interests, preferences, and locations. Cross-device linking is the practice of associating different browsers and/or devices (such as mobile devices and televisions) based on information about the likely relationships among them.

Factual Inc. is a member of the NAI and adheres to the NAI Code of Conduct as described on the NAI website. At this time, Foursquare is working towards its compliance with the Code of Conduct. We adhere to the DAA Self-Regulatory Principles as described on the DAA website. At this time, we do not honor web browser Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals or other similar mechanisms. In addition, we may use or transfer data for interest-based advertising, including cross-device linking.

You may opt out of seeing interest-based ads from us or our third party advertising partners on your desktop browser and/or mobile web browser by visiting the DAA at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. You may opt out of seeing interest-based ads and ad delivery/reporting by downloading the DAA’s AppChoices mobile application, which is available here:

*   DAA AppChoices iOS
*   DAA AppChoices Android
*   DAA AppChoices Amazon

When you opt out on a particular device, we will stop using and transferring mobile app data from that device for interest-based advertising on, and ad delivery/reporting to, other linked devices. Additionally, we will also stop using mobile app data coming from other linked devices for interest-based advertising on, and ad delivery/reporting to, the device from which the choice was exercised. If you use more than one device, you should opt out on each device. Certain versions of your device’s operating system permit you to opt out of interest-based advertising. Please visit your device settings to limit such tracking.

Please note that when you opt out of interest-based ads, you will still see ads, but they will no longer be based on your interests or behavior. In addition, we may also continue to collect, use and transfer mobile app data for purposes other than interest-based advertising and ad delivery/reporting, as described in the “How Is My Data Used By Foursquare” section of this Privacy Policy.

If you are a California resident, for more information about your privacy rights, please see the section of this Privacy Policy below titled “California Residents”.

How to Opt-Out of Advertising Services by Foursquare’s Enterprise Customers and Data Suppliers

To opt out of interest-based advertising by Foursquare's Enterprise Customers and data suppliers that participate in the NAI or the DAA, visit NAI’s opt out page or the DAA’s consumer choices page.

U.S. Segments Disclosure

The NAI requires members to disclose standard interest segments based on health- and wellness-related interests and information, or based on political information or interests, that are used to deliver interest-based advertisements in the United States.

Foursquare Labs, Inc. and its affiliates provide Enterprise Customers with such standard segments to deliver interest-based advertisements and for other purposes; our health segments are based on data that is not considered sensitive under the NAI Code of Conduct. For a list of our standard health and political segments, please [click here](https://foursquare.com/privacy/segments).
