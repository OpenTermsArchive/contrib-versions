**Important information about Amazon FreeTime Unlimited and Kindle FreeTime Unlimited subscriptions**

*   FreeTime Unlimited is offered as a monthly or pre-paid subscription and on a per-child or per-family basis.
*   You'll need a current, valid payment method to sign up and to pay for the FreeTime Unlimited subscription.
*   Unless you notify Amazon before a charge that you want to cancel or do not want to auto renew, you understand your subscription will automatically continue and you authorize Amazon (without notice to you, unless required by applicable law) to collect the then-applicable fee and any taxes, using any payment method we have on record for you.
*   If all payment methods we have on file for you are declined for payment of your subscription fees, your subscription will be canceled unless you provide us with a new payment method. If you provide us with a new payment method and are successfully charged before your subscription is canceled, your new subscription period will be based on the original renewal date and not the date of the successful charge.
*   We may offer a FreeTime Unlimited Free Trial to eligible customers from time to time. We consider your free or paid FreeTime Unlimited subscription history when determining whether you're eligible for a FreeTime Unlimited Free Trial. Customers may also receive a pre-paid subscription to FreeTime Unlimited as part of a device purchase.
*   At the end of your free trial period, or any applicable pre-paid period that came with your device, you'll be automatically upgraded to the applicable paid monthly subscription plan, with no commitments. If you don't want to upgrade to a paid monthly subscription, you can cancel at any time during the free trial period (or prior to the end of your pre-paid subscription) from within the FreeTime section of Settings on your Fire tablet, Kindle e-Reader, or Amazon Fire TV, from within Settings section of the FreeTime on Android app, or by contacting Customer Service. Canceling your free trial subscription at any time during the trial period will revoke your rights to all FreeTime Unlimited content, and your payment method will not be charged. During the remainder of the original trial period, you have the option to re-instate your free trial, with the same right to cancel at any time during the original trial period if you do not want to upgrade to a paid subscription.
*   The monthly renewal price of your FreeTime Unlimited subscription may change, for example if you become an Amazon Prime member or if you cancel your Amazon Prime membership. We may change the subscription terms or fees at any time and in our discretion.
*   You may cancel your monthly subscription at any time within the FreeTime section of Settings on your Fire tablet, Kindle e-Reader, or Amazon Fire TV, from within Settings section of the FreeTime on Android app, by contacting Customer Service or by visiting the Amazon Parent Dashboard. You may cancel your pre-paid subscription by contacting Customer Service.
*   If you cancel a monthly subscription, you will receive a prorated refund for the unused portion of your last month. However, if you cancel a pre-paid subscription, including any subscription to FreeTime Unlimited received as part of a device purchase, you will not receive any refund, including any partial or prorated refund, for any unused months.
*   The content available in the FreeTime Unlimited subscription may change at any time. We cannot guarantee that any specific book, movie, TV show, app, skill, game, or other content will remain available via the subscription, and certain content is only available on compatible devices.
*   Amazon may collect taxes applicable to the subscription fee.
*   We may terminate your access to the subscription at our discretion without notice. If we do so, we will give you a prorated refund. However, we will not give any refund for termination related to conduct that we determine, in our discretion, violates any applicable law or terms of use, or involves fraud or misuse of the subscription.
