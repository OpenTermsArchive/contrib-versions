App.net - Terms of Service

Last Updated: February 7, 2013

We asked our attorney to help us craft some terms that outline, with the least amount of legalese, the important things you need to know about accessing and using App.net's website and service (collectively, "Service"). These are our terms of service ("Terms"). Please read them carefully.

Accepting these Terms

If you access or use the Service, it means you agree to be bound by all of the terms below. So, before you use the Service, please read all of the terms. If you don't agree to all of the terms below, please do not use the Service. Also, if a term does not make sense to you, please let us know by e-mailing support@app.net.

Changes to these Terms

We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. For instance, we may need to change these Terms if we come out with a new feature or for some other reason.

Whenever we make changes to these Terms, the changes are effective six (6) weeks after we post such revised Terms to our website (indicated by revising the date at the top of these Terms), or upon your acceptance if we provide a mechanism for your immediate acceptance of the revised Terms (such as a click-through confirmation or acceptance button). It is your responsibility to check the website regularly for changes to these Terms.

If you continue to use the Service after the revised Terms go into effect, then you have accepted the revised Terms.

Privacy Policy

For information about how we collect and use information about users of the Service, please check out our privacy policy.

API Developer Terms and Conditions

If you are a developer of applications for use with the Service, our Developer Terms and Conditions apply with respect to your use of our API and the development of applications. In the event there is a conflict between these Terms and the Developer Terms and Conditions, the Developer Terms and Conditions will apply.

Third-Party Services

From time to time, we may provide you with links to third party websites or services that we do not own or control. Your use of the Service may also include the use of applications that are developed or owned by a third party. Your use of such third party applications, websites, and services is governed by that partyâ€™s own terms of service or privacy policies. We encourage you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of any third party application, website or service that you visit or use. Note that while App.net itself does not work directly with advertisers, third party applications may contain advertising or marketing materials provided by such third parties. We require third-party developers who use our API to maintain certain standards with respect to your use of their applications and services.

Creating Accounts

When you create an account, you may use any name (real, fake or otherwise) for other users to see. If you create a "pseudo anonymous" account, please provide your real name for billing purposes. If you create a "parody" account, you must clearly label your account as such and still provide your real name for billing purposes.

When you create an account you also agree to maintain the security of your password and accept all risks of unauthorized access to your account data and any other information you provide to App.net.

If you discover or suspect any Service security breaches, please let us know as soon as possible.

Subscriptions

Right now, we are providing developer and member tier subscriptions. The payment and other terms applicable to your subscription are outlined in our Subscription Terms.
