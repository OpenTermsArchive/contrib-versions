Our fees do not include any fees that an API Partner, your bank, the recipient’s bank or other third party may separately charge.

**10.2 You can see our fee structure on the Pricing page.** For clarity, the fees applicable to you as set out on the ["Pricing" page](https://wise.com/pricing) forms part of this Agreement which may be subject to change as set out in “**Our right to make changes**”.

**11.1** Our Services include the ability to convert currencies, for example:

* a) As part of a Money Transfer;
* b) In your Wise Account, where you may add money in one currency and then later use those funds to send money to a third party, spend money on your Card or withdraw money in a different currency; or

We may change our reference rate provider from time to time without notice to you.

**11.3** For some currencies, we do not use the mid-market exchange rate, including where we are required by law to use a different reference rate for the exchange rate for your currency pair. For example, for currency conversions to Nigeria (NGN), we are required to use the rate set by the Central Bank of Nigeria. For these currencies we will notify you of the exchange rate offered by Wise when you initiate a current conversion.

**11.4** We may not process your currency conversion order until we hold or have received the funds and fees specified on our [Pricing Page](https://wise.com/gb/pricing/send-money?source=GBP&target=EUR&payInMethod=BANK_TRANSFER&sourceAmount=1000). It is your responsibility to ensure money is sent to us to fund a currency conversion order (whether in your Wise Account or as part of a Money Transfer or any other Service we provide) in a timely manner. We cannot be responsible for the time it takes for the money to be sent to us by your bank or payment service provider.

**11.5 Refusing a currency conversion order.** We reserve the right in our sole discretion to refuse any currency conversion order. Reasons for refusal may include but are not limited to incorrect information about a recipient, insufficient available funds, or where we believe you may have violated this Agreement, including where we believe you are or may be attempting to engage in currency trading or other trading for purposes not permitted by this Agreement. We will endeavour to notify you of any refusal, using the contact information that you have provided to us, stating (where possible) the reasons for such refusal and explaining how to correct any errors. However, we will not notify you if such notification may be unlawful.

**12.1 About your Wise Account:**

* a) Your Wise Account allows you to hold, spend, send and receive funds and convert currency.
* b) The funds held on your Wise Account do not expire.
* c) The funds held on your Wise Account will not earn any interest.
* d) You may hold your funds in any currencies that we support from time to time.
* e) You may withdraw funds from your Wise Account at any time subject to certain conditions, please see “Withdrawing funds from your Wise Account” in section 23 for more details.
* f) Certain limits may be placed on your Wise Account depending on your country of residence, verification status or other legal considerations. For more information about these limits, you can contact us.
* g) The funds held on your Wise Account belong to the individual which is registered as the Wise Account holder.
* h) You need to have sufficient funds on your Wise Account to enable us to execute your transactions. If you don’t have sufficient funds in your Wise Account, we may refuse to execute pending or future transactions. We cannot be responsible for the time it takes for the money to be sent to us by your or a third party’s bank or payment service provider.
* i) We may at our sole and absolute discretion reject a requested transaction, or refund a payment or other transaction, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation, where the value of your Wise Account could directly or indirectly exceed any value permitted under the applicable laws and regulations or any other regulatory or risk limit prescribed for that Wise Account.

**12.2** Your money in the Wise Account is issued in accordance with the Law of 11 March 2018 on the status and supervision of payment institutions and electronic money institutions, access to the business of payment service providers and to the activity of issuing electronic money.

**12.3 Wise is not a bank, and your Wise Account is not a bank account.** Wise is not a bank and your funds held with Wise, including balances in your Wise Account, are not insured by any deposit protection scheme, including the Guarantee Fund and Protection Fund. Wise holds funds held by its customers in permissible investments in accordance with applicable laws. Wise owns the interest or other earnings on these investments, if any. The Account Details that we provide to you (as described further below) are a means to receive funds from third parties into a bank account held by Wise and its affiliates, so that Wise can credit your Wise Account, and are not a bank account number for a bank account held by you.

As required by the Payment Services Law, we will make sure that your money is always safe and identifiable in our books at any time.

**12.4 Adding money to your Wise Account.** To add money to your Wise Account, you need to log in to your Wise Account and follow the steps. We are not responsible for the funds you have added until we have received them. For clarity, when you add funds to your Wise Account, we are the recipient of those funds. This means the bank or payment service provider you used to send the funds to us is the one responsible for making sure we receive them so that we can credit them to your Wise Account.

**12.5 Funding your Money Transfer and Wise Account with Direct Debit.** If you choose to pay for a Money Transfer or to add funds to your Wise Account by using the Direct Debit feature (including BACs), you will need to provide your bank login details or bank account details to us, including your bank account number and routing number. When you choose to pay using Direct Debit and provide your details, you confirm that your details are correct, that you are authorised to access and transmit funds from your bank account, that your bank account is in good standing with the account-holding financial institution, and that you have the authority to initiate an electronic funds transfer in the amount at issue to or from your bank account.

In the event that your Direct Debit payment results in a Reversal, Wise will try to take the payment from your bank account again. For example, if there isn’t enough money in your account when we try to take the payment, we may attempt to debit it again.

**12.6 Pay-in Methods.** You may be presented with one or more methods of adding funds to your Wise Account. For example, you may be able to use a bank transfer, authorise Wise to debit the money from your bank or payment account with a third party, or use a credit card or debit card (in this Agreement, we will call these methods “**Pay-in Methods**”). The number of Pay-in Methods made available to you will depend on a number of factors including where you live and your verification status with us. We cannot guarantee the availability of any particular Pay-in Method and we may change or stop offering a Pay-in Method at any time without notice to you.

**12.7 Pay-in Methods must be in your name.** Any Pay-In Method that you use to add money to your Wise Account must be in your name.

**12.8 Chargebacks on your payment instrument.** If you selected a Pay-in Method which can be subject to chargeback (for example a credit card), you agree that you will only exercise this chargeback right if:

* a) we have breached this Agreement; or
* b) there was an unauthorised use of your payment instrument, meaning that you did not execute or authorise the payment.

You agree that you will not exercise your chargeback right for any other reason. If we need to investigate or take any actions in connection with a chargeback caused by or related to you, we may charge you for our costs in doing so and may deduct those costs from your Wise Account or close your Wise Account or limit your access to our Services.

**12.9 When we will credit your Wise Account.** We will credit your Wise Account once we have received your funds. For some Pay-in Methods such as a credit or debit card, we will credit the funds as soon as possible subject to our right of Reversal. This means if we credit your Wise Account for the full amount you intended to add but this amount does not reach us within a reasonable time, and you use that credited amount, for instance to send money or make a purchase, we may deduct that amount from your Wise Account. This could make your Wise Account have a negative balance (see “What happens if you owe us money” in section 29.9).

**12.10 Adding money with your debit or credit card.** If you choose to add money using your debit or credit card, provided we offer this method, you will need to provide your card details to us, including your card number and cardholder name. When you choose to add money via debit or credit card, you confirm that your card details are correct, that you are authorised to access and transmit funds from your card account, that your card account is in good standing with the account-holding financial institution, and that you have the authority to initiate a debit or credit card payment in the amount at issue to or from your card account. You authorise us to initiate credits and debits to your bank account through card payment networks in order to process your transaction, including any applicable fees and charges, and this authorisation shall remain in effect so long as you are able to use our Services, unless cancelled in accordance with this Agreement.

**12.11 Restrictions on adding Money.** We only offer the Pay-In Methods you see when you access our Services. Other methods, such as a paper or e-cheque, will not be accepted. For legal, security, or other reasons, there may be limits on your chosen Pay-in Methods or currencies, including how much you can add to your Wise Account.

**12.12 Adding money to your Wise Account from other sources.** In certain currencies, we may provide you with local account details that you or a third party can use to send money directly to your Wise Account (“**Account Details**”). Account Details do not reflect separate payment accounts. The Account Details that we provide to you are only a means to receive funds from third parties into a bank account held solely in the EEA by Wise Europe SA.

**12.13** We may carry out verification checks when you request Account Details in addition to the checks required to obtain a Wise Account, and we may carry out further checks on an ad-hoc basis. From time to time your Account Details may change. When this occurs, you are responsible for updating third parties and other arrangements you may have to receive funds using your Account Details. Wise is not responsible for issues that arise when Account Details are changed, and it is your responsibility to notify third parties that your Account Details have changed.

**12.14** If you provide your Account Details to a third party, you agree that you will not impose a surcharge or any other fee solely for accepting the receipt of funds in that way.

**12.15 When money received is shown in your Wise Account.** Any money you receive into your Wise Account will be recorded in your transaction history. You should check and confirm the receipt of incoming funds in your Wise Account regularly and let us know if there are any irregularities or discrepancies.

**12.16 Receiving Money from USD Account Details.** You may receive funds into your Wise Account using the US Automated Clearing House system or domestic wire transfer method. If you choose to receive money using these methods, for example by sharing your USD Account Details with a payee, you will not have access to such funds until we receive the cleared funds, which could take several days or longer.

* * *

13\. Reversals and Chargebacks
------------------------------

**13.1 Funds added to your Wise Account may be subject to Reversal.** Funds added to your Wise Account could be Reversed or subject to a Chargeback, which means that you will not get those funds back. If a Reversal or Chargeback causes you to have a negative balance, you will be immediately liable to Wise for the negative balance plus any fees. Funds added to your Wise Account may be Reversed by Wise, or may be Reversed or subject to a chargeback to the person paying you the money or the payment provider, and/or may be liable to repayment to Wise if, without limitation, we have reason to believe:

* a) Wise, or any other party, sent the funds to you in error;
* b) The sending of the funds was unauthorised or fraudulently undertaken or induced;
* c) The funds were received for activities that have violated any laws, this Agreement, the Additional Documents, or any other agreement between you and Wise;
* d) The funds are, for some other reason, Reversed by the sender or a payment provider; or
* e) Any other error resulting in your Wise Account being credited in circumstances where you are not the lawful recipient and/or lawfully entitled to retain the funds.

**13.2** If any funds are Reversed by the sender or any payment provider, you agree that Wise may refund, deduct or Reverse the Received Amount plus any applicable fees from your Wise Account (if applicable) in the same currency as the original transaction. If your Wise Account balance for the relevant currency is insufficient to cover the amount of a refund, deduction or Reversal, Wise may at its discretion perform a currency conversion to refund or Reverse the transaction, subject to the exchange rate being offered by Wise in the applicable currencies at that time. If a Reversal or chargeback causes you to have a negative balance, you will be immediately liable to Wise for the negative balance plus any losses to Wise, if any.

**13.3 Chargeback Fees.** If you receive a debit or credit card-funded payment into your Wise Account and you (or a third party) pursue a chargeback for the transaction with the card issuer, then Wise may apply a fee for facilitating the chargeback process and will remove the chargeback funds from your Wise Account, including funds held in the Main Account, Jars or Groups.

* * *

14\. Maintaining your Wise Account
----------------------------------

**14.1 Transaction history is displayed on your Wise Account.** All of your transactions (including your current balance, funds you have added, received, sent and/or withdrawn), including related fees and exchange rates, if applicable, are recorded in the statement section of your Wise Account.

**14.2 Statements.** You have the right to request a physical account statement showing your Wise Account activity. You may view your Wise Account statement by logging into your Wise Account. Please note that it may be possible to view your Wise Account in a way that some of your transactions are hidden. This is to allow you to isolate transactions from particular recipients to determine your spending with those recipients. Be sure to readjust your viewing preferences if you have used this feature to default to see all transactions.

**14.3 Check your Wise Account regularly.** You must check your Wise Account regularly and carefully and contact us immediately (upon the value date of the debit or credit) if you don’t recognise a transaction or think we have made a payment incorrectly. You must tell us about any unauthorised or incorrectly executed transactions immediately.

**14.4 Auto Conversion.** For certain currencies, you may be able to set one or more conversion orders to be automatically executed once the exchange rate you pick is offered by our Services (an “**auto conversion order**”). There may be limits to the number of auto conversion orders you are able to set up, as well as the amounts of money you can schedule to convert. Wise does not guarantee that it will be able to execute your auto conversion order in all circumstances.

**14.5 You accept the risks of holding funds in multiple currencies.** You agree and accept all the risks associated with maintaining an account that can hold balances in multiple currencies including any risks associated with fluctuations in the relevant exchange rates over time.

**14.6 We are not a currency trading platform.** Wise is not a currency trading platform. You agree that you will not use your Wise Account for seeking to profit from currency conversion or foreign exchange trading or other types of speculative trading, or for speculative trading purposes, conversion arbitrage, conversion options or any other activity that Wise determines is primarily for the purpose of gaining or making gains based on currency conversion rates.

Accordingly, you should not use our Services, including the Wise Account or the auto conversion order function for this purpose, including creating multiple auto conversion orders or a series of Money Transfers without the intention of completing them. If we detect that you are using our Services for this purpose, we may, at our sole discretion, set a limit on the number of auto conversion orders you may create, cancel your orders, set a limit on the amount of money you can convert or transfer in one or more currencies or in the same currency, restrict your ability to access certain features or use our Services, or suspend or close your Wise Account. Wise may also hold, cancel, or reverse any transaction we determine to violate this policy and disgorge your gains.

**14.7 Negative Balances.** You promise to always have a zero or positive balance in your Wise Account and to repay Wise if your Wise Account balance is negative (each a “**Negative Currency Account**”), including as a result of a Chargeback, Reversal, deduction of fees, any other error, or any other action. That negative amount represents an amount you owe to Wise and you must repay the negative amount immediately without any notice from us. We may send you reminders or take such other actions to recover the negative amount from you, for example, we may use a debt collection service or take further legal actions. We may charge you for any costs we may incur as a result of these collection efforts. For more information, see “**What Happens if you owe us money**”.

* * *

15\. Jars
---------

**15.1 What is a Jar?.** A “Jar” is a sub account within the Wise Account that can be used to segregate a portion of your funds. You may use Jars to keep funds for a designated purpose in the future, such as paying invoices or to assist with your budgeting. You can only put funds into your Jar by moving money from a balance or another Jar in your Wise account. You can use the funds directly from a Jar to send or transfer funds out of the Jar to external accounts or move the money back into a Wise Account balance or another Jar. You should keep enough unrestricted money in your Wise Account to cover all anticipated fees. Wise is not responsible for fees resulting from unfunded transactions due to funds being in a Jar.

**15.2 Jars are not savings accounts, do not have their own account numbers, and don’t earn interest.** Money held in your Jars does not earn any interest and is not insured by any deposit protection scheme, including the FSCS.

* * *

16\. Using or spending funds in your Wise Account: Direct debits
----------------------------------------------------------------

**16.1 Direct Debit.** You can set up a direct debit to allow someone else to take money from your Wise Account. This is an agreement between you and a third party. This mandate shall be on the basis of you express consent and signature and the power of attorney to be given must refer expressly to the underlying agreement, which in turn determines the scope of the claims to be subject to the direct debit, with regard to their nature, due date and, if possible, the exact amount. The direct debit can only be legally established if you have been informed of the underlying agreement in advance. You may agree to allow such automatic withdrawal on a recurring or sporadic basis. Examples of automatic payments that can be arranged by you include those that may be called a “billing agreement,” "subscription," "recurring payment,” “reference transaction,” "pre-authorised transfer" or "preapproved payment." In case the execution of the debit order fails due to insufficient funds, we may retry the execution at a later stage.

**16.2** Once your direct debit is cancelled, all future automatic payments under your agreement with that seller will be stopped. If you cancel a direct debit, you may still owe a third party for any goods or services that you receive but have not paid for.

**16.3** If you have given advance authorisation, either to a third party or to Wise, that permits the third party to take or receive payments from your Wise account on a regularly recurring basis (for example, every month or otherwise on a routine cycle), and if such payments will vary in amount, you have the right to advance notice of the amount and date of the transfer from the seller, typically 3 days before the transfer is made. If the seller provides the option, you may choose to receive this advance notice only when the amount of your automatic payment will fall outside a range established between you and the seller.

**16.4** If you have authorised a direct debit and Wise performs a currency conversion for an automatic direct debit transaction, Wise will use the exchange rate offered at the time the transaction is processed.

* * *

17\. Using or spending funds in your Wise Account: Cards
--------------------------------------------------------

**17.1 Cards.** The Card is a Debit/ Prepaid card that can be used to access and spend the funds in your Wise Account and it can be used, for example, to pay for goods and services ​online, over the phone, or in person. ​The Card can be used to withdraw money from ATMs in and the EEA and overseas. The Card is not a guarantee card, charge card or credit card. It is not for resale. The Card may be cancelled, repossessed, or revoked at any time without prior notice subject to applicable law.

**17.2 Digital card.** You may apply for a digital Card as well as a physical Card. Your digital Card will have a different set of card details from your physical Card, but will draw from the funds in your Wise Account in the same manner as your physical Card. Your digital Card is activated instantly once those details are provided to you and can be used right away. The issuance of the digital Card is free of charge and there are no monthly or annual fees. You can freeze your digital Card at any time and unfreeze it once you are ready to use it again.

**17.3** The provisions relating to the Guarantee Fund and Protection Fund do not apply. Your Card is linked to your Wise Account, which is a Payment account and is not a bank account. The provisions relating to the Guarantee Fund and Protection Fund do not apply to your Wise Account or Card.

**17.4 Verification.** We may carry out verification checks when you request a Card in addition to the checks required to obtain a Wise Account, and we may carry out further checks on an ad-hoc basis. These checks may increase the time it takes to process your order for a Card. We are not responsible for any delays as a result of carrying out those checks. If you have paid a fee for your Card but we decide you do not meet our verification requirements, we will cancel your Card and refund the fee you paid for your Card within 14 days of our decision. We may not refund the fee in certain circumstances.

**17.5 Card transaction fees.** You agree to pay the Card transaction fees set forth in the [Pricing page](https://wise.com/pricing). All the Card transaction fees will be withdrawn from your Wise Account and will be assessed as long as there are funds remaining on your Wise Account. If at any time your remaining funds are less than the Card transaction fees being assessed, the funds in your Wise Account will be applied to the Card transaction fees resulting in a zero amount on your Wise Account, and your Card may be declined. The remainder of the Card transaction fees due will be collected the next time you add funds to your Wise Account.

**17.6 How to activate your Card.** When you receive your Card, please sign the back of it as soon as you receive it and keep it safe. The Card PIN is a 4-digit code that you may be asked to enter when making a payment using the Card. Choose a secure PIN that cannot be easily guessed by third parties.

**17.7 Refunds in different currencies.** If you receive a refund on a Card payment in a currency for which you have a balance, we will credit said balance. If you receive a refund in a currency that you do not hold a balance or if you receive a refund in a currency we do not support, we will credit your Wise Account in the card's default currency, which may require us to convert the currency.

**17.8** You must not make purchases or withdraw funds with your Card that exceed the amount of funds available in your Wise Account. If any purchase or withdrawal takes you over your available funds or the card limits indicated by Wise the transaction will be declined.

**17.9 Spending limits.** We may increase or decrease spending limits or add additional limits from time to time in our sole discretion without notice to you except as required by law, for security or other reasons.

**17.10 Other limits.** We may, at our reasonable discretion, decline the use of your Card for situations including, but not limited to:

* a) Pre-authorised regular payments;
* b) Transactions at self-service petrol pumps;
* c) Transactions for cash (other than ATM withdrawal) including for example cash back, cash from a bank, money orders, traveller’s cheques, foreign exchange, or bureau de change, or any illegal purposes;
* d) Where it is not possible for the supplier of the good or service to obtain online authorisation that you have sufficient funds in your Wise Account for the transaction. For example: transactions on trains, ships, and some in-flight purchases;
* e) Where there is suspicion that the Card is being used to exploit vulnerabilities in a merchant’s payment processing or the card payment ecosystem; or
* f) Where we have grounds to believe that you have made false statements in an attempt to obtain reimbursement for a previous transaction.

**17.11 We are not liable for certain losses.** You are solely responsible for losses arising from your gross negligence or fraud. We also will not be liable in the following instances:

* a) If through no fault of ours, you do not have enough funds available in your Wise Account to complete the transaction;
* b) If a merchant refuses to accept your Card;
* c) If an ATM where you are making a cash withdrawal does not have enough cash;
* d) If an electronic terminal where you are making a transaction does not operate properly;
* e) If access to your Card has been blocked after you reported your Card lost or stolen or if Wise has reason to believe that your Wise Account was compromised; (see “When can we suspend or cancel your Card?”)
* f) If there is a hold or your funds are subject to legal or administrative process or other encumbrance restricting their use;
* g) If the requested transaction is unauthorised as defined under this Agreement;
* h) If circumstances beyond our control (such as fire, flood, or computer or communication failure) prevent the completion of the transaction, despite reasonable precautions that we have taken; or
* i) Any other exception stated in this Agreement.

**17.12 No Warranty Regarding Goods or Services as Applicable.** Wise is not responsible for the quality, safety, legality, or any other aspect of any goods or services you purchase with your Card. Any disputes or issues with any goods or services you purchase with your Card should be addressed to the merchants or individuals from whom the goods and services were purchased.

**17.13 Returns and Refunds.** If you are entitled to a refund for any reason for goods or services obtained with your Card, you agree to accept credits to your Wise Account for such refunds and agree to the refund policy of that merchant. Merchant refunds will be provided to Wise for sending to the Wise Account when they are received. Wise has no control over when a merchant sends a refund transaction; there may be a delay between the date of the refund transaction and the date the refund amount is credited into your Wise Account and refunds from merchants may be in an amount the same or less than the amount of the corresponding debit.

**17.14 When can we suspend or cancel your Card.** Along with closing or suspending your Wise Account, we can suspend or cancel your Card, including if the activity on your Card or Wise Account appears suspicious, fraudulent or may be associated with criminal activity or activity which is inconsistent with this Agreement. Unusual or multiple purchases may prompt a merchant inquiry or Card suspension to allow us to investigate such activity.

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to limit your use of the Card. We may refuse to issue or replace a Card or may revoke Card privileges, other than as required by applicable law. You agree not to use or allow others to use an expired, revoked, cancelled, suspended or otherwise invalid Card. We will not incur liability to you because of the unavailability of the funds that may be associated with your Card or Wise Account.

**17.15 Unjust enrichment.** In case you notice a refund has been received twice for the same transaction, for example in both your Wise Account and from a merchant, you are required immediately to let us know, and we always reserve the right to debit back a previously issued refund when a refund for the same transaction has been provided by the merchant as well, without prior notice.

**17.16 Disputed transactions.** In case of disputed Card transactions, we may, subject to any restrictions under applicable law, decide not to proceed with chargebacks at our sole discretion. Reasons for this might include:

* a) Not receiving sufficient information to determine that an error occurred;
* b) Not receiving a notification about the payment error in a timely manner;
* c) Disputes being caused by the risky nature of transactions undertaken with the Card;
* d) We have evidence that you or someone you gave your Card to authorised the transactions in dispute.

* * *

18\. Card transactions
----------------------

**18.1 You authorise every transaction.** You agree that any use by you of your Card, card number or PIN constitutes your authorisation and consent to the transaction.

**18.2 Cards for individuals are for your sole personal use.** If you are an individual, you undertake not to authorise others to use your identity or user status, and you may not assign or otherwise transfer your Card to any other person or entity.

**18.3 Priority of currencies and currency conversion when you use your Card.** If you withdraw cash or make a purchase in a currency for which you hold a balance in your Wise Account, Wise will use that currency for your withdrawal or purchase and you consent to and authorise Wise to convert the currency in place of your Card network.

**18.4 In a currency that you do not hold in your Wise Account.** If you withdraw cash or make a purchase in a currency for which you do not hold in your Wise Account, or if you withdraw cash or make a purchase in a currency in an amount that exceeds the available funds that you hold in that currency, Wise may convert funds from another currency that you hold in your Wise Account to cover that transaction, and Wise currency conversion fees will apply. You cannot set a default or preferred currency to convert from.

**18.5** When determining which currency to convert where you have more than one currency in your Wise Account, Wise will use the currency with the lowest conversion fee for the currency needed to complete the cash withdrawal or purchase made by you. In cases where the conversion from several currencies will have the same conversion fee, we will convert based on the highest conversion rate. For more information on which currencies would be used in the event that you use your Card to withdraw cash or make a purchase in a currency that you do not hold in your Wise Account, please check the Wise [pricing page](https://wise.com/gb/pricing/card-fees) or contact [Customer Support](https://wise.com/help/contact).

**18.6 In a currency that is not supported by Wise.** If you withdraw cash or make a purchase in a foreign currency that is not supported by Wise, the rate charged by the VISA/MASTERCARD® ​network shall apply.

**18.7** Please note that if you are offered the option at a point of sale (“**POS**”) terminal to pay in local currency or to pay in your home or another currency, ​you must pick the local currency if you want the Wise rate to apply to your transaction.

* * *

19\. When your Card expires
---------------------------

**19.1 Your Card has an expiry date.** You can only use your Card up until the expiry date which will be shown on the back of your Card and/or in the App.

**19.2 We’ll aim to notify you 2 months before your current Card will expire.** You then may order a new Card by following the instructions on our Website or App. A replacement Card fee may apply (see [here](https://wise.com/multi-currency-account/pricing)).

**19.3** If you do not want your Card to be renewed, you can simply let it expire without ordering a replacement. Your Card will be deactivated and you will not be able to use it after its expiry. You should destroy your expired Card.

* * *

20\. Keep your Card safe
------------------------

**20.1 Keep your Card safe.** Never let another person or party use your Card and keep it safe. Only use the card under conditions that are sufficiently safe, whereby the secure nature of the PIN is safeguarded. Memorise your PIN and never disclose this and other security information to anyone. Sharing these details can lead to unauthorised access to your Wise Account and you will be solely responsible for transaction(s) made in this situation. Wise will not be liable for any loss arising due to any such unauthorised transaction(s). Do not effect an unauthorised transfer of the card to third parties (including spouses, family members or friends) or allow it to be used by them. Also, never let the card out of your sight when paying with the card.

**20.2 Report any suspicious incidents.** If your Card is lost or stolen, if you suspect that someone else knows your PIN, or if you think your Card, card number or PIN may be misused, you agree that you must stop using the Card, and immediately freeze or replace the Card. If this happens, we recommend that you both call and email Customer Support right away. You can also freeze your Card with immediate effect on our App under the Account tab. If you find the Card after you have reported it lost, stolen or misused, you must destroy it and tell us as soon as you find it.

**20.3 Your Liability for Unauthorised Card Transactions.** In addition to other limitations of liability provided for under this Agreement, your liability for the unauthorised use of your Card may also be limited by Visa/MasterCard​​. Under the MasterCard​​ rules, you will have no liability for a transaction that was not authorised by you if you exercised reasonable care in safeguarding the Card from risk of loss or theft, and, upon becoming aware of such loss or theft, promptly reported such loss or theft to [Customer Support](https://wise.com/help/contact). Under the Visa rules, you will have no liability for a transaction that was not authorised by you if you were not fraudulent or negligent in the handling of the Card, and, upon becoming aware of the unauthorised transaction, promptly notified such transaction to [Customer Support](https://wise.com/help/contact). This chargeback policy is subject to change without notice and changes made by Visa/MasterCard​ will automatically apply to you.

**20.4 Replacement of card.** If you need to replace your Card for any reason, please follow the instructions on our Website or App or ​contact [Customer Support](https://wise.com/help/contact)​. We will charge a fee for the replacement Card.

**20.5 Disclosure of information to law enforcement authorities.** If your Card is used without your permission, or is lost, stolen or if you suspect the Card may be misused, we may disclose to law enforcement agencies any information which we reasonably believe may be relevant.

* * *

21\. Card cancellation rights
-----------------------------

**21.1 Cancelling your Card.** You may cancel your Card at any time with no charge by logging into your Wise Account or through the App. Your card fee and any delivery fee, where applied, is non-refundable.

**21.2 We have the right to cancel your Card.** Note that subject to any restrictions under applicable law, we reserve the right to cancel or suspend your Card at any time for any reason. Use of your Card is subject to all applicable rules and customs of any clearinghouse or other association involved in transactions.

* * *

22\. Withdrawing funds from your Wise Account
---------------------------------------------

**22.1 You can request to withdraw your funds.** You may withdraw all or some of the balance in your Wise Account. We may charge you a fee for each withdrawal request, we will let you know the exact amount when you submit your request. You can also find out more information about the fees we charge on the [Pricing page](https://wise.com/pricing).

**22.2 Payout Methods available to you.** You may be presented with one or more methods of withdrawal (in this Agreement, we will call these methods "**Payout Methods**"). The number of Payout Methods made available to you will depend on a number of factors including where you live and your verification status with us. We cannot guarantee the use of any particular Payout Method and may change or stop offering a Payout Method at any time without notice to you.

**22.3 You must provide correct information to us.** When setting up your withdrawal request, you must ensure that the information you provide is correct and complete. We will not be responsible for money sent to the wrong recipient as a result of incorrect information provided by you.

**22.4 What happens if you provide incorrect recipient information.** If you have provided incorrect information to us, we may, but are not required to, assist you in recovering your funds. We cannot guarantee that such efforts will be successful as they rely on the policies and practices of other banks and institutions. In addition, Wise may not be able to confirm that your recipient’s name and account number match, as the names and other information associated with third party accounts may not be known to Wise. This means that if you provide an incorrect account number, your funds will most likely go to the wrong account.

**22.5 Your withdrawal request is subject to limits.** You agree that your Wise Account is subject to withdrawal limits. If your withdrawal request exceeds the current limit, we may decline your request or we may require you to provide additional documents to us so that we can carry out additional checks before allowing the money to be withdrawn. These limits may be amended at the sole discretion of Wise and without prior notice.

**22.6 Delay in withdrawal.** We may delay a withdrawal in certain situations, including if we need to confirm that the withdrawal has been authorised, to complete verification checks, or if other payments to your Wise Account have been reversed (for example, as a result of a chargeback or Reversal). We cannot be held responsible for any such delays.

**22.7 Finality.** Payouts, currency conversions and Card or other transactions executed by us are final and irrevocable once you request them, unless otherwise provided in this Agreement or pursuant to applicable law.

**MONEY TRANSFERS**
-------------------

23\. Sending money
------------------

**23.1 Information you need to provide to set up a Money Transfer.** To set up a Money Transfer, you will need to provide certain information to us, including, but not limited to, the full name of your recipient, your recipient’s bank account details or their Wise Account information and the amount and currency to be transferred.

**23.2 Payment order limits.** We may, at our sole discretion and without prior notice, place limits on the amount you may send per Money Transfer.

* * *

24\. Paying for Your Money Transfer
-----------------------------------

**24.1 How to pay for your Money Transfer.** To pay for your Money Transfer, you need to access your Wise Account or profile, by logging in on our Website or App or via an API Partner, and follow the steps provided.

**24.2 Payment methods.** You may be presented with one or more methods of paying for a Money Transfer (for example, a bank transfer, or a credit cards or debit card). The number of payment methods made available to you will depend on a number of factors including where you live and your verification status with us. We cannot guarantee the availability of any particular payment method and we may change or stop offering a payment method at any time without notice to you.

**24.3 Payment instruments must be in your name.** Any payment instrument (for example, the credit card or debit card or a bank account from which you make a transfer) you use to pay for a Money Transfer must be in your name. We may reject the payment if the instrument is not in your name.

**24.4 You need to provide us with sufficient funds after you set up your Money Transfer and before we can process it.** We are not responsible for the funds you have sent, or for completing the Money Transfer you have set up, until we have received them. We may only process your Money Transfer if we hold or have received sufficient cleared funds in accordance with this Agreement and the instructions provided. If you send us funds prior to setting up a Money Transfer order, those funds will either be placed into your Wise Account, or, if you do not have one, we will attempt to return them to you. It is your responsibility to fund your Money Transfer in a timely manner. We cannot be responsible for the time it takes for the money to be sent to us by your or a third party’s bank or payment service provider.

**24.5 Guaranteed rates.** We may provide you with a guaranteed foreign exchange rate for a period of time. We will notify you of the guaranteed rate and the time period during which we are offering that rate (the “**Guaranteed Period**”) when you create your Money Transfer. Guaranteed Periods are subject to the following conditions:

* a) The Guaranteed Period may be extended if your Money Transfer is created over the weekend or on a public holiday.
* b) We must receive sufficient funds from you during the Guaranteed Period in order to convert your funds at the guaranteed rate. You will see when we have received your funds in your Wise Account or profile. Wise is not responsible for the failure of a third party to send your funds to us in a timely manner.
* c) If we receive your funds after the Guaranteed Period, we will not be able to convert your money using the guaranteed rate and your transfer will become a non-guaranteed rate transfer. Accordingly, we may convert your money at the applicable exchange rate at the time we receive your money or we may email you and ask you if you want to proceed with your transfer at the new exchange rate.
* d) If the Wise exchange rate changes by 5% or more during the Guaranteed Period, we can, at our discretion, suspend your transfer for a reasonable period of time or cancel your transfer and refund the money to you.
* e) For certain currencies, including where you are paying for a Money Transfer with Japanese Yen (JPY), the guaranteed rate will only be offered after your address has been verified by us.

We may change these guaranteed rate conditions or suspend the guaranteed rate feature at any time.

**24.6 The Wise exchange rate.** We will confirm the available exchange rate (if applicable) for your Money Transfer:

* a) when you place your Money Transfer, if it is a guaranteed rate Money Transfer; or
* b) when we have received your payment, if it is a non-guaranteed rate Money Transfer.

**24.7 Chargebacks on your payment instrument.** If you selected a payment method which can be subject to chargeback (for example a credit card), you agree that you will only exercise this chargeback right if:

* a) we have breached this Agreement; or
* b) there was an unauthorised use of your payment instrument, meaning that you did not execute or authorise the payment.

You agree that you will not exercise your chargeback right for any other reason, including a dispute with a recipient. If we need to investigate or take any actions in connection with a chargeback caused by or related to you, we may charge you for our costs in doing so and may deduct those costs from your Wise Account (if you have one) or limit or remove your access to our Services. See “**What happens if you owe us money**”.

**24.8 When we will complete your Money Transfer.** We will complete your Money Transfer once we have received your funds. For some payment methods such as a credit or debit card, we may send your Money Transfer as soon as possible.

**24.9 Paying with your debit or credit card.** If you choose to pay for a Money Transfer using your debit or credit card, provided we offer such options, you will need to provide your card details to us, including your card number and cardholder name. When you choose to pay with a debit or credit card, you confirm that your card details are correct, that you are authorised to access and transmit funds from your card account, that your card account is in good standing with the account-holding financial institution, and that you have the authority to initiate a debit or credit card payment in the amount at issue to or from your card account. You authorise us to initiate credits and debits to your bank account through card payment networks in order to process your transaction, including any applicable fees and charges, and this authorisation shall remain in effect so long as you are able to use our Services, unless cancelled in accordance with this Agreement.

**24.10 When we receive your request.** If your Money Transfer request is received by us after 5pm CET (CEST from the last Sunday of March until the last Sunday in October) on a Business Day or on a day that is not a Business Day (e.g., a weekend or bank holiday), your Money Transfer will be deemed received on the following Business Day.

**24.11 What happens after you have submitted your Money Transfer request.** Once we have received your Money Transfer request, we will provide you with a unique transaction number which you can find in your Wise Account or profile. You should quote this number when communicating with us about a particular Money Transfer or other transaction.

**24.12 Sending money using an email address.** If you send money to a person using an email address which is not registered with us, the money will not be credited until the intended recipient has claimed the money following the steps we have set out for them in an email that they will receive. Until that process is successfully completed, there is no relationship between us and the intended recipient and the money continues to belong to you. We will refund the money to you if the intended recipient does not claim the money or if they have failed our recipient checks within a reasonable time period as determined by us.

**24.13 Delay in transfer.** We may delay processing a Money Transfer in certain situations, including if we need to confirm that the transaction has been authorised by you, as a result of verification checks or due diligence reviews, or if other payments to your Wise Account have been reversed (for example, as a result of a Chargeback or Reversal). Wise is not responsible for such delays.

**24.14 Completion time of your Money Transfer.** The estimated completion time of your Money Transfer will be provided to you when setting up your Money Transfer.

**24.15 We will use reasonable efforts to ensure funds arrive at your recipient’s account within the timeframe provided.** We will use reasonable efforts to ensure that the funds arrive in the recipient’s bank account or payment account within the notified timeframe provided to you. We do not have any control over the time it may take for the recipient’s bank or payment provider to credit and make available funds to the recipient.

**24.16 Refusal of your Money Transfer.** If we are unable to complete your Money Transfer, we will let you know as soon as possible and, if possible, tell you the reasons for the refusal and an explanation of how to correct any factual errors. However, we are not required to notify you if such notification would be unlawful.

**24.17 You may cancel your Money Transfer before your funds are converted.** You may cancel your Money Transfer by following the instructions set out in our Help Centre. You cannot cancel your Money Transfer once your funds have been converted.

We must refund to you an authorised payment transaction initiated by or through a payee that has already been executed, if the two following conditions are met:

* a) when the payment transaction was authorised, the exact amount of the payment transaction was not specified;
* b) the amount of the payment transaction exceeds the amount that you can reasonably expect, based on your previous spending pattern, the terms of your framework contract and relevant aspects of the case.

At our request, you shall demonstrate that these conditions have been met. You have the right to request this refund for a period of eight weeks from the date the funds were debited.

The refund corresponds to the full amount of the executed payment transaction. The value date of the credit to your Currency Account shall be no later than the date on which the amount was debited.

In the case of a payment transaction initiated by a payment initiation service provider or by or through a payee, you may not revoke the payment order after giving your consent to the payment initiation service provider to initiate the payment transaction or your consent to the payee to execute the payment transaction.

However, in the case of a direct debit you may revoke the payment order at the latest at the end of the business day preceding the day on which the Currency Account is debited in accordance with the direct debit agreement, provided that the beneficiary agrees with the revocation.

If it was agreed that the execution of the payment order would start on a specific day, at the end of a certain period or on the day on which you make the funds available, you may revoke this payment order at the latest by the end of the business day preceding the day on which the payment account is debited in accordance with the conditions agreed.

After the expiry of the aforementioned time limits, the payment order may only be revoked if this has been agreed upon between you and the payment service providers concerned.

**24.18 When will I be notified of my scheduled Money transfer?** If you have scheduled a Money transfer in advance then we will notify you 24 hours before your upcoming Money Transfer, setting out the total fees and the estimated exchange rate for that Money Transfer. By scheduling a Money Transfer, you agree to Wise sending the funds using the exchange rate at any time on the scheduled date. If you have opted in to receiving confirmation emails, we will send you a Money Transfer receipt after successfully sending your scheduled Money Transfer.

**24.19 You must ensure the information you provide to us is correct.** You must make sure that the information you provide when setting up a Money Transfer is accurate. If we have processed your order in accordance with the information you have provided to us it will be considered correctly completed even if you have made a mistake.

**24.20 What happens if you provide us with incorrect information.** If you have provided incorrect information to us, we shall make reasonable efforts to recover your funds and to assist you in recovering your funds. We cannot guarantee that such efforts will be successful as they rely on the policies and practices of other banks and institutions. In addition, Wise may not be able to confirm that your recipient’s name and account number match, as the names and other information associated with third party accounts may not be known to Wise. This means that if you provide an incorrect account number, your funds will most likely go to the wrong account.

**24.21 Finality.** When you make a Money Transfer, the settlement and payout to the recipient are final and irrevocable unless otherwise provided in this Agreement or pursuant to applicable law.

**OTHER LEGAL TERMS**
---------------------

28\. Unauthorised Transactions.
-------------------------------

**28.1** Any disputes of transactions on statements of account that were not authorised or incorrectly initiated or not correctly carried out must be notified in writing to Wise Europe SA without delay and in any event within 13 months of being debited or credited, so that Wise Europe SA can verify that the transaction was authenticated, correctly registered and booked and was not affected by a technical failure or other defect.

**28.2** Card holders and/or account holders and Wise Europe SA each accept, insofar as each of them is concerned, that the journal tape or similar data carrier on which all the details regarding each transaction carried out at any ATM or POS terminal, together with the information registered on the microcircuit on the chip, constitutes satisfactory, binding documentary evidence that the transaction was correctly registered and booked and not affected by a technical failure or other defect. Customers may prove the contrary by any means of evidence.

**28.3** You acknowledge that entries recording the use of the card together with the correct PIN will constitute satisfactory proof that relevant transactions were initiated by card holders themselves, using their means of access.

* * *

29\. Our responsibility for loss or damage
------------------------------------------

**29.1 Unforeseeable loss or damage.** We are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if either it is obvious that it will happen or if, at the time the contract was made, both we and you knew it might happen, for example, if you discussed it with us during your sign up process.

**29.2 We do not exclude or limit in any way our liability to you where it would be unlawful to do so.** This includes liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or the negligence of our employees, agents or subcontractors; for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation. Nothing in this agreement constitutes an exoneration Wise Europe SA from its liability for its wilful misconduct, gross negligence or that of its employees or agents, or, except in circumstances beyond its control, for the non-performance of an obligation that constitutes one of the main performances of the contract.

**29.3 We are not liable for technological attacks.** We will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by a virus, or other technological issues or attacks or harmful material that may infect your computer equipment, computer programmes, data or other proprietary material related to your use of our Services.

**29.4 We have no control over websites linked to and from our Website.** We assume no responsibility for such Third Party Materials or any loss or damage that may arise from your use of them.

**29.5 Our liability to you for unauthorised payments.** The payer shall bear the loss up to the notification of the unauthorised payment transaction up to an amount not exceeding 50 euros in respect of all unauthorised payment transactions resulting from the use of a lost or stolen payment instrument or from the unauthorised use of a payment instrument. Notwithstanding this, the payer shall not bear any loss if:

* a) the loss, theft or misuse of a payment instrument could not have been detected by the payer before a payment was made, unless the payer himself had acted fraudulently; or
* b) the loss was caused by the acts or omissions of an employee, agent or branch of a payment service provider or of an entity to which the activities were outsourced.

The payer shall bear all losses relating to unauthorised payment transactions if the payer has suffered them as a result of having acted fraudulently or deliberately or by gross negligence having failed to comply with one or more of his obligations.

Whether or not gross negligence occurred in the given circumstances is up to the courts, whose decision is final. The courts are not bound by Wise Europe SA’s stance in the matter. Card holders are nonetheless deemed to recognise the importance of keeping their card safe and secure and using it as set out in this agreement.

If they fail to do so, the card could be improperly used. Wise Europe SA warns the card holders that the following behaviour, inter alia, can lead to claims for which may be held liable:

* a) failing to fulfil their obligations or breaching security requirements, such as keeping the card together with its PIN in a recognisable form (such as written on the card or a document that card holders keep with the card or on themselves);
* b) divulging their PIN to third parties, such as spouses, family members and friends, and allowing the card to be used by third parties;
* c) using the card under conditions that are unsafe, leaving the card unattended (such as at work, in a hotel or vehicle (even if locked) or in any place effectively open to the public (such as a hospital))
* d) failing to immediately report to Wise Europe SA the loss or theft of the card, any entries of unauthorised transactions or errors or irregularities on their statements of account;
* e) failing to have the card stopped immediately after it has been retained by an ATM or payment terminal.

The User will not be liable for any financial losses arising from payment transactions not requiring strong customer authentication or the User to enter a PIN.

However, this arrangement does not apply in the event of fraud on the part of the User, in which case the User will be liable for all losses.

The User will not be liable for any loss attributable to transactions carried out after notification was provided in the way set out above, except in case of fraud on the part of the User, in which case liability will be borne entirely by the User.

**29.6** You are responsible for checking your Wise Account or profile regularly. We rely on you to regularly check the transactions history of your Wise Account or profile and to contact Customer Support immediately in case you have any questions or concerns.

**29.7 We are not liable for things which are outside of our control.** We (and our affiliates) cannot be liable for our inability to deliver or delay as a result of things which are outside our control.

**29.8 You are liable if you breach this Agreement or applicable laws.** In the event of loss, claims, costs or expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of your breach of this Agreement, any applicable law or regulation and/or your use of our Services, you agree to defend, compensate us and our affiliates and hold us harmless. This provision will continue after our relationship ends.

**29.9 What happens if you owe us money.** In the event you are liable for any amounts owed to us for whatever reason, we may immediately remove such amounts from your Wise Account (if available). If there are insufficient funds in your Wise Account to cover your liability or you do not have a Wise Account, you agree to repay the outstanding amount to us immediately on demand along with any applicable fees and interest. In the event that you do not repay the outstanding amount, then, without prejudice to any other rights we may have, we reserve the right to collect your debt to us by using any payments received for our Services in the future (such as to fund a Money Transfer or your Wise Account), and otherwise you agree to reimburse us through other means. We may also recover amounts you owe us through other collection avenues, including, without limitation, through the use of a debt collection agency. We may recover all reasonable costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement.

**29.10 Disclaimer of Warranty.** The Services are provided “As-Is” “Where Is” and “Where Available” and without any representation or warranty, whether express, implied or statutory. Wise specifically disclaims any implied warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. We disclaim all warranties with respect to the Services to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, including the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement and title.

**29.11 Availability of Services.** We will try to make sure our Services are available to you when you need them. However, we do not guarantee that our Services will always be available or be uninterrupted. We may suspend, withdraw, discontinue or change all or any part of our Service without notice. We will not be liable to you if for any reason our Services are unavailable at any time or for any period.

**29.12** You are responsible for making all arrangements necessary for you to have access to our Services.

32\. Other important terms
--------------------------

**32.1 Third Party rights.** This Agreement is between you and us. Except as expressly provided in this agreement, no other person shall have any rights to enforce any of its terms.

**32.4 Enforcement.** Even if we delay in enforcing this Agreement, we can still enforce it later. If we delay in asking you to do certain things or in taking action, it will not prevent us from taking steps against you at a later date.
