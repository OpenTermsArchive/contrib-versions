To use Google One, you must accept (1) the [Google Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms), and (2) these Google One Additional Terms of Service (the “**Additional Terms**”). Terms that are not defined in these Additional Terms have the meanings given to them in the Google Terms of Service.

Please read these documents carefully. Together, these documents are known as the “**Terms**”. They establish what you can expect from us as you use our [services](https://policies.google.com/terms/service-specific), and what we expect from you.

We also encourage you to read our [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) to better understand how you can [update, manage, export, and delete your information](https://account.google.com/).

1\. Our Service
---------------

Google One offers subscription plans with paid storage shared across Gmail, Google Photos, and Google Drive, including subscription plans with additional benefits provided to you by Google or through third parties. Google One also offers subscription plans and AI credits for paid access to certain AI features built by Google. Your use of additional Google or third-party benefits is governed by the terms of service applicable to such benefits. Some benefits may not be available in all countries and may be subject to other restrictions. Please visit the [Google One Help Center](https://support.google.com/googleone/answer/16105039) for more information.

The Google One service is provided to you by the Google entity set out in the [Google Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms). When you purchase a Google One subscription or AI credits, you enter into a separate contract with the seller, which may be a Google entity (see Section 2) or a third party. If you have a Google One subscription through a third party or affiliate, then your subscription may be subject to additional terms from that third party or affiliate.

**_AI Credits_**

You can use AI credits to enable and process your requests within designated AI features. The number of credits required for a specific action (e.g., generating a video) will be communicated to you within the relevant product or feature. Google reserves the right to modify the credit cost for using AI features. AI credits can only be used to access certain AI features that may be made available by Google from time to time.

AI credits can expire after a certain period, as set out when you acquire them.

You have no right or title in AI credits except as expressly stated in these Terms. You may not sell or transfer AI credits to another user or account, or attempt to sell or transfer AI credits. When you purchase AI credits, you are pre-paying for the use of certain designated AI features. AI credits are not a digital currency, security, commodity, or any other kind of financial instrument and are not redeemable for any cash value. AI credits are only redeemable for the specified AI features within the Google ecosystem. Any unused AI credits may be forfeited upon termination or cancellation of your Google One plan, subject to any applicable refund policies.

Learn more about AI credits [here](https://support.google.com/googleone/answer/16287445).

2\. Purchase and Payment
------------------------

Google One subscriptions are for an indefinite term, and you’ll be charged at the beginning of each billing cycle according to your subscription terms (for example, monthly, annually, or another period), unless you unsubscribe.

When you purchase a Google One subscription or AI credits, your purchase will be subject to separate terms from the seller. For example, when you sign up for a Google One subscription or purchase AI credits through the Google Play Store, your purchase will be subject to the [Google Play Terms of Service](https://play.google.com/about/play-terms/index.html).

The seller for your purchase of a Google One subscription or AI Credits through the Google Play Store is:

*   For consumers in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa: Google Commerce Limited
*   For consumers in India: Google Ireland Limited
*   For consumers in the rest of Asia, Pacific: Google Digital Inc.
*   For consumers in the United States and the rest of the world: Google LLC.

When you purchase a Google One subscription or AI credits through a third party or affiliate, that third party or affiliate will charge your payment method and be responsible for managing any issues with your payment, including cancellations and refunds.

If the seller is unable to charge you for the Google One subscription, you may not be able to access Google One until you update your form of payment with the seller. If you fail to update your form of payment within a reasonable amount of time following that notice, we may cancel or suspend your access to Google One.

3\. Pricing and Offers
----------------------

**Offers.** We may offer trials for a Google One subscription at no charge from time to time. If you purchase a subscription to Google One that includes a trial, you will receive access to Google One for the duration of the trial period. At the end of the trial period, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you will be automatically charged the price of the subscription each billing period if you provided a valid form of payment to the seller and will continue to be charged until you cancel your subscription. To avoid any charges, you must cancel your subscription with the seller before the end of the trial period. We may also offer discounts on subscriptions to Google One from time to time. Additional terms and conditions, including eligibility criteria, may apply to these offers and any such additional terms will be made available to you prior to redemption or purchase. Offers are void where prohibited or restricted by applicable law.

**Changes to pricing.** We may change the prices for Google One subscriptions or AI credits from time to time, for example, to reflect inflation, changes in applicable taxes, changes for promotional offerings, changes to Google One, or changing business needs. For changes to pricing for Google One subscriptions, these changes will apply after your current payment period is complete and when the next payment is due from you after the notice. We will give you at least 30 days’ prior notice of a price increase before you are charged. If you are given less than 30 days’ prior notice, the change will not apply until the payment after the next payment is due. If you do not wish to continue with your Google One subscription at the new price, you may cancel the subscription as described in the Cancellations section of these Terms, and you will not be charged further amounts for the subscription, provided you have notified us before the end of the current billing period. Where the price increases and consent is required, your subscription will be canceled unless you agree to the new price.

4\. Cancellations and Refunds
-----------------------------

**Cancellations and withdrawals.** If you cancel your subscription, you will retain access to Google One for the remainder of your current billing period, unless you are entitled to cancel with immediate effect or have other cancellation or withdrawal rights as further described in the [Help Center](https://support.google.com/googleone/answer/2736362). If you have a right of withdrawal and wish to exercise it, you must communicate your decision to withdraw by an unequivocal statement to the seller from which you made the purchase. If you request to begin the performance of services during the withdrawal period, you may be required to pay a pro-rated amount in proportion to the services provided up until you have communicated to the seller your withdrawal from the contract.

If you elect to delete Google One via [service deletion](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/81987), you agree that you may lose access to Google One services immediately. If you prefer to retain Google One services for the remainder of your billing period, please [cancel your subscription](https://support.google.com/googleone/answer/9056360) rather than deleting Google One.

**Refunds.** If you purchased a Google One subscription or AI credits, the [refund policy](https://support.google.com/googleone/answer/2736362) will apply. You will need to contact the seller from which you made the purchase to request a refund. You may have consumer rights under applicable law that cannot be limited by contract. These Terms do not restrict those rights.

5\. Customer Support
--------------------

Google One may include access to customer support across certain Google services. In the event that customer support is unable to assist you with your request, we may transfer or redirect you to the customer support service of the applicable Google service. If your Google One subscription is canceled or suspended, your unresolved customer support issues may also be suspended and you may need to submit a new enquiry once you have reinstated your subscription. Please visit our [Help Center](https://support.google.com/googleone) for more information on customer support.

6\. Family Sharing
------------------

Your Google One subscription may allow you to share certain benefits with your family group (“**Family Sharing**”). If you do not wish to share any benefits with your family group, you must disable Family Sharing for Google One or leave your family group. Only Google One plan managers may add family members to, and enable or disable Family Sharing on, a Google One subscription. Please visit our [Help Center](https://support.google.com/googleone/answer/9004015) for more information on Family Sharing.

If you are part of a family group on Google One, members of your family group will be able to see certain information about you. For example, if you join a family group with Google One Family Sharing enabled, other members of (and invitees to) the family group may see your name, photo, email address, the devices you have backed up, AI credits consumed, and the amount of storage space you are using. Family group members may also see if certain additional benefits included with the Google One subscription have been redeemed by a family member.

If you are the Google One plan manager in your family group and you either disable Family Sharing or leave your family group, the other members of your family group will lose access to the Google One subscription. If you have been granted access to Google One through Family Sharing by your Google One plan manager, you will lose access to Google One if you leave your family group, or if your Google One plan manager disables Family Sharing or leaves the family group.

7\. Mobile Backup and Restore
-----------------------------

Google One may include enhanced data backup and restore functionality (“**Backup and Restore**”) for qualifying mobile devices. Using Backup and Restore may require installation and activation of additional applications, such as Google Photos. You may change your Backup and Restore options at any time within the Google One application. If your Google One subscription is suspended or canceled, you may lose access to data saved to Backup and Restore after a period of time, pursuant to applicable Android Backup policies.
