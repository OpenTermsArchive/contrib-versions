Google One Additional Terms of Service
======================================

Effective: November 9, 2021 |

Archived versions[](https://one.google.com/terms-of-service/archive)

To use and access Google One, whether you are the Google One plan manager, are part of a family group sharing Google One, or a non member user, you must accept (1) the [Google Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms), and (2) these Google One Additional Terms of Service (the “**Google One Additional Terms**”).

Please read each of these documents carefully. Together, these documents are known as the “**Terms**”. They establish what you can expect from us as you use our services, and what we expect from you.

Except for Google One customers in France, if these Google One Additional Terms conflict with [the Google Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms), these Additional Terms will govern for Google One.

Although it’s not a part of these Terms, we encourage you to read our [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy), to better understand how you can [update, manage, export, and delete your information](https://account.google.com/).

1\. General Description of Google One
-------------------------------------

Google One is made available by Google to provide you with a destination for Google services and support, provide rewards and offers, and discover new features and products. Google One features may include paid storage plans shared across Google Drive, Google Photos, and Gmail, customer support for certain Google products, family sharing features, mobile backup and restore, and other benefits provided to you by Google or via third parties. Your use of additional Google products or services is governed by the terms of service applicable to such products or services. Some products, features, and benefits may not be available in all countries. Please visit the Google One Help Center for more information.

2\. Paid Accounts - Payment, Subscription, and Refunds
------------------------------------------------------

**Payments.** Only Google One plan managers may purchase, upgrade, downgrade, or cancel a Google One membership. Google accepts payment through a Google Payments account or any other form of payment indicated prior to purchase.

**Subscription cancellations.** Google Payments will automatically take payment from the date you sign up for a Google One membership, and your subscription to Google One will automatically renew until it is cancelled. You may cancel at any time. If you cancel your subscription, you will retain access to Google One for the remaining term of your existing subscription. If, in addition, you elect to delete Google One via [service deletion](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/81987), you agree that you may lose access to Google One services and functionality immediately, without refund for the remaining term of your existing subscription. If you prefer to retain Google One services for the term of your subscription, please [cancel your subscription rather](https://support.google.com/googleone/answer/9056360) than deleting Google One.

**Right of Withdrawal.** If you are in the EU or the UK, you have the right to cancel within 14 days of signing up for, upgrading or renewing your Google One membership without giving any reason. To exercise the right of withdrawal, you must communicate your decision to withdraw by an unequivocal statement to the provider from which you made the purchase.

**Refunds.** For additional rights of refund, please refer to the relevant policy from [**Google Play**](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2479637) or the provider from which you made the purchase. If you purchased from Google, no refunds or partial billing periods are available, except as required by applicable law. If you purchased other than from Google, such as using your iPhone or iPad, or signed up for a Google One membership via the App Store or other third party provider, the provider’s refund policy will apply. You’ll need to get in touch with that third party (e.g. Apple support) to request a refund.

**Changes to pricing.** We may change the Google One price(s) in effect, but will give you prior notice of these changes. These changes will apply after your current payment period is complete, when the next payment is due from you after the notice. We will give you at least 30 days’ prior notice of a price increase before you are charged. If you are given less than 30 days’ prior notice, the change will not apply until the payment after the next payment is due. If you do not wish to continue with Google One at the new price, you may cancel or downgrade at any time from within your Google Play, Apple, or third party subscription settings. Your cancellation or downgrade will apply to the next billing period after the current service term unless otherwise set out in the applicable payment platform terms. Where the price increases and consent is required, your subscription may be cancelled unless you agree to the new price. If your subscription is cancelled and you later decide to re-subscribe, you will be charged at the then-current subscription rate.

3\. Customer Support
--------------------

Google One provides you with access to customer support across a number of Google products and services ('Customer Support'). In the event that Customer Support is unable to assist you with your support request, we may transfer or redirect you to the customer support service of the Google product in question. This includes instances in which Google One does not provide Customer Support for the specific Google product or service being requested. If your Google One subscription is cancelled or suspended, your unresolved Customer Support issues may also be suspended and you may need to submit a new enquiry once you have reinstated your subscription.

4\. Limited Member Benefits
---------------------------

Google One may provide you with content, products, and services that are discounted or at no charge ('Limited Member Benefits'). Limited Member Benefits may be limited by country, supply, duration, membership tier, or other factors, and not all Limited Member Benefits will be available to all Google One subscribers. Some Limited Member Benefits may only be redeemable by the Google One plan manager, and some Limited Member Benefits may be redeemable by members of your family group or only by the first family member activating the redemption. Some Limited Member Benefits are not redeemable by Google Accounts for children and teenagers, and for trial users. Other eligibility criteria may also apply.

We may work with third parties to provide you with their services or content as Limited Member Benefits through Google One. In order to redeem a Limited Member Benefit provided by a third party, you acknowledge that Google may provide the third party with any personal information necessary to process your redemption, in accordance with the Google Privacy Policy. Your use of any third-party Limited Member Benefits may be governed by such third party’s terms of use, license agreement, privacy policy or other such agreement.

5\. Families
------------

Certain features of Google One, including Drive, Gmail, and Photos storage space, may be shared with your family group if you have one ('Family Sharing'). Your family group may also receive, and be able to redeem, Limited Member Benefits that are made available to you. If you do not wish to share such features with your family group, you must disable Family Sharing for Google One or leave your family group. Only Google One plan managers may add family members to, and enable or disable Family Sharing on, Google One membership.

If you are part of a family group on Google One, members of your family group will be able to see certain information about you. If you join a family group with Google One Family Sharing enabled, other members of, and invitees to, the family group may see your name, photo, email address, the devices you have backed up, and the amount of space you use in Google Drive, Gmail, and Google Photos. Family group members may also see if a Limited Member Benefit has been redeemed by a family member.

If you are the Google One plan manager in your family group and you disable Family Sharing or leave your family group, the other members of your family group will lose access to Google One. If you have been granted access to Google One through Family Sharing by your Google One plan manager, you will lose access to Google One if you leave your family group, or if your Google One plan manager disables Family Sharing or leaves the family group.

6\. Mobile Backup and Restore
-----------------------------

Google One may provide you with enhanced data backup and restore ('Backup and Restore') functionality for qualifying mobile devices and mobile plans. Using Backup and Restore may require installation and activation of additional apps, such as Google Photos. You may change your Backup and Restore options at any time within the Google One app. If your Google One Membership is suspended or cancelled, you may lose access to data saved to Backup and Restore after a period of time, pursuant to Android Backup policies.

7\. Sponsored Plans
-------------------

Google One may be offered to you through a sponsored plan provided by a non-Google sponsoring party, such as your network operator, internet service provider or other third party (in any case, a 'Sponsored Plan'). Any features available or fees for Sponsored Plans are determined by your sponsoring party, and you should refer to their terms of service for information about the Google One pricing information and the terms of your Sponsored Plan. You may be able to upgrade or downgrade your Sponsored Plan through your sponsoring party (in which case their payment and subscription terms apply to the upgrade or downgrade) or by selecting an upgrade or downgrade option directly from Google One (in which case the payment and subscription terms here will apply to your upgrade or downgrade). Your eligibility for, and continued access to, Google One through a Sponsored Plan is determined by the sponsoring party, and your Sponsored Plan may be suspended or terminated at any time by the sponsoring party.

8\. Privacy
-----------

Google collects and uses information provided by you in order to provide you with Google One as described in these Terms, in accordance with the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). We may collect and use information about your use of Google One in order to provide the Google One services, process your transactions, or to maintain and improve Google One. We may also use information about your use of other Google services in order to improve Google One, to provide you with benefits, or to market Google One. You can control the collection and use of your Google activity at myaccount.google.com.

We may share certain information about you with third parties, as necessary to provide Google One, including to determine your qualification for, or your redemption of, third-party Limited Member Benefits or your eligibility for a Sponsored Plan or a trial membership. We may also share information about you with your family group in order to provide information about your family group’s Google One status and subscription.

In connection with your use of Google One, we may send you service announcements, administrative messages, and other information. We may also send you emails and device notifications associated with your Limited Member Benefits. You may opt out of some of those communications.

9\. Changes
-----------

We reserve the right to make changes to Google One, and Google One may be revised to provide more, or different, features. You agree that your subscription to Google One is for Google One in its form at the time of subscription. As set out in Section 2 above, we may also, from time to time, offer different terms and tiers for Google One, and the subscription fee for such terms or tiers may vary.

10\. Termination
----------------

Google may stop providing Google One to you at any time, including for breach of these Terms. If you are on a Sponsored Plan, your access to Google One may also be suspended or terminated by your sponsoring party. Google reserves the right to suspend or terminate Google One at any time, upon reasonable notice to you.
