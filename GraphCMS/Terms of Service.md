### 4\. Fees for Use of the GraphCMS Services

4.1 Subject to the Terms, the GraphCMS Services are provided to you without charge up to certain limits. Usage over this limit requires your purchase of additional resources or services.

4.2 For all purchased resources and services, we will charge your credit card on a monthly basis or at the interval indicated in GraphCMS fees and payment policies, if different. Late payments may bear interest at the rate of annually 9 % above base interest rate (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less). Charges are exclusive of taxes. You are responsible for paying all taxes and government charges, and all reasonable expenses and attorneys fees GraphCMS incurs collecting late amounts. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 30 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights).

GraphCMS may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such as subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims. GraphCMS shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information by such third parties. GraphCMS reserves the right to discontinue the provision of the GraphCMS Services to you for any late payments.

4.3 GraphCMS may change its fees and payment policies for the GraphCMS Services by notifying you at least fifteen (15) days before the beginning of the billing cycle in which such change will take effect.
