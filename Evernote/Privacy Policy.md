II. Information Access and Disclosure Does Evernote Share My Personal Information or Content?

Evernote is not in the business of selling or renting your information. Outside of actions you take within the Service to communicate via Evernote’s Collaboration Features, or to authorize third-party applications, we only disclose your information - and then only the minimum information necessary - when:

*   We have your explicit consent to share the information.
*   We need to share your information with Service Providers who process data on our behalf in order to operate and improve the features and functionality of the Service. complete your payment transactions. fulfill your product or service requests, including sales, delivery and support requests. and help us communicate with you as described elsewhere in this policy. these providers are subject to strict data protection requirements in keeping with our commitments under our US-Switzerland Safe Harbor certification as discussed below.
*   We need to share your information with resellers of a Paid Service or product in order to ensure accuracy in the payment for such Paid Service or product, the management of your account and the delivery of your purchase and related support services.
*   We believe it is necessary to investigate potential violations of our Terms of Service, to enforce the Terms of Service, or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or potential threats against persons, property or the systems on which we operate the Service.
*   We determine that the access, preservation or disclosure of information is required or permitted by law to protect the rights, property or personal safety of Evernote and users of the Service, or is required to comply with applicable laws, including compliance with warrants, court orders, subpoenas, legal process, or other lawful government requests (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements).
*   We do so in connection with the sale or reorganization of all or part of our business, as permitted by applicable law.

Some third parties’ embedded content or plugins on the Service, such as Facebook “Like” buttons, may allow their operators to learn that you have visited our website, and they may combine this information with other, identifiable information they have collected about your visits to other websites or online services. For more information with additional examples, see the “Social Media Features” section of our Cookie Information page.

We do not share your account information or user activity history with third parties for the purpose of enabling them to deliver their advertisements to you. As described on our Cookie Information page, we contract with third-party advertising networks in order to deliver relevant Evernote advertisements to you across the Internet and to manage our communications with you.

You may opt out of certain ad targeting and retargeting services by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out page, or the Network Advertising Initiative’s opt-out page. We also may share a hashed identifier derived from the personal information you have submitted to us (such as your email address) with Service Providers who help us manage and track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.

If I’m a Member of an Evernote Business Account, Can My Account Administrator See Any of My Data?

An Administrator (“Admin”) of an Evernote Business account has access to all Notes you create in any Notebook associated with that Evernote Business account. The Admin also can see the Evernote Business Notes or Notebooks you’ve shared and with whom you have shared this Content. (The Admin will see the profile name for other members of the Evernote Business account or the contact information for people who are not in the Evernote Business account). An Admin cannot access any of the Notes in your personal account or any of your Work Chat Content, however. If domain auto-approval is turned off for your Evernote Business account and your personal Evernote service account is associated with your Evernote Business account’s email domain (e.g., \[username\]@widgets.com), then when you send a Work Chat to someone else with an email address on the same email domain as you, then the Admin will know that you sent the Work Chat message but will not be able to view the Content of that message. We do this so an Admin knows who else in your organization may need to be invited to join the Evernote Business account.

For more information on how your personal Evernote service account works with your Evernote Business account, please review our Help &. Learning article on this subject entitled “Are a user's personal notebooks or personal information accessible by other Evernote Business users or Admins?”.

What Information Does Evernote Share When I Use Collaboration Features?

The Evernote service has a number of Collaboration Features, and when you use these features to collaborate with others, some of the personal information you provide to Evernote, including your status as an Evernote service user, may be visible to these other users:

*   If you share a Note or Notebook, or if you join a shared Note or Notebook, then anyone who has access to that Note or Notebook may see your user profile. (If you have not added any profile information, then you will be identified solely by the email address associated with your Evernote service Account.)
*   If you initiate or respond to a Work Chat message, then the person with whom you are chatting will be able to view your profile.
*   In a group Work Chat where you are a recipient of a message but you have not responded, only other Evernote service users you are connected to will see your user profile. Other people in the group chat will only see the information the sender used when sending you the Work Chat message (e.g., email address or telephone number).
*   If you are an Evernote Business user, other members of your Evernote Business account will see your full Evernote Business account profile. But Evernote service users who are not in your Evernote Business account will only see your profile name and image.

In addition, anyone who has access to a shared Notebook will be able to see – for each Note in that Notebook – the Note contents, information about where and when the Note was created, as well as the Note history, tags and reminders associated with a particular Note. But when Notes are shared via Work Chat, people with access to the Note will only see the Note contents, plus information about where and when the Note was created.

What Gets Shared When I Use Third Party Apps with My Evernote Account?

Some third-party applications and services that work with our Service may ask for permission to access your Content or other information about your account. Those applications will provide you with notice and request your consent in order to obtain such access or information. Please consider your selection of such applications and services, and your permissions, carefully. We encourage you to review each party’s contract terms and privacy policy. To learn more about some of these applications and what data they may access, visit our Third Party Application Permissions page.

Do Evernote Employees Access or Review My Notes?

As a rule, Evernote employees do not monitor or view your personal information or Content stored in the Service, but we list below the limited circumstances in which our employees may need to access or review your personal information or account Content:

*   We believe our Terms of Service has been violated and confirmation is required or we otherwise have an obligation to review your account Content as described in our Terms of Service;
*   We need to do so for troubleshooting purposes;
*   Where necessary to protect the rights, property or personal safety of Evernote and its users (including to protect against potential spam, malware or other security concerns). or
*   In order to comply with our legal obligations, such as responding to warrants, court orders or other legal process. We vigilantly protect the privacy of your account Content and, whenever we determine it possible, we provide you with notice if we believe we are compelled to comply with a third party’s request for information about your account. Please visit our Information for Authorities page for more information.

What does Evernote do with my Content?

Evernote also uses a number of technologies to help you get the most out of the Service. Our systems automatically analyze your data, including your account Content, in order to power Evernote features and to continually improve the Service for you. This may include, for example:

*   Making search work the way you want it to;
*   Showing you information most relevant to how you are using the Service at a specific time or location;
*   Detecting when it looks like you’re making a list and suggest features or tips that might be useful;
*   Showing you information relevant to a note you are creating or reviewing. The information we show you may include Notes from your own account, Notes from accounts you are connected to through Evernote Business or Collaboration Features, and third party content that you have elected to receive.

We believe features like these will enhance your experience using the Service. In addition, we may suggest Evernote service features or products to you that we think will help you get the most out of our Service. We do not share your account Content with anyone for advertising purposes.

In addition, as part of our efforts to protect your account and the functionality of the Service, our automated systems may analyze the emails you send to and from your Evernote service account to detect spam, malware or other potential security concerns and may block delivery of such emails.

Does Evernote Ever Make Any of My Personal Information or Content Public?

No. Please note, however, that certain portions of the Service, such as user notebooks designated as “public” and our user forum, are open to any online viewer. Any information that you post in these locations can be read, collected and used by anyone and could enable others to send you unsolicited messages.
