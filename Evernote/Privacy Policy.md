I. Information Collection and Use What Information Does Evernote Collect About Me and Why?

We collect very little personal information about our users. A list of the “Personal Information” Evernote may collect, and why we collect it, follows:

*   Your username, email address, and contact preferences. This lets us create your account, provide you with convenient and personalized access to your account, and deliver and support the Service. This information also helps us communicate with you about your use of the Service, product announcements, software updates and orders you have placed in the Evernote Market, as well as respond to your requests for assistance (including providing account verification support if you’re having difficultly accessing your account). In addition, we may use your Personal Information to send you direct marketing emails and special offers. For more information, please see the section below entitled, “Will Evernote Send Me Emails?”
*   For Premium users and customers of the Market, your information required to complete a commercial transaction on our site. We use this information to enable and fulfill your transaction.
*   The geographic area where you use your computer and mobile devices (as indicated by an IP address or similar identifier), and the language you select when interacting with the Evernote Service. We collect this information in order to help us deliver and support the Service, including by localizing your Evernote Service experience. It also helps us improve our understanding of how our users use the Service.
*   The Evernote products and services you use. This information helps us deliver and support the Service and respond to your requests for assistance. We also collect this information to improve our understanding of how our users use the Service and engage with the Evernote Market.
*   Any Content you add to your account. We don’t use this information for any purpose other than to make sure it is available to you when you use the Service.
*   For purchases of physical goods from the Evernote Market, a shipping address and, in certain cases, contact information. We use this information to deliver the purchased products to you or your intended recipient.
*   A unique device identifier (for example, an IMEI or SIM number or other identifier) for hardware using Evernote software. If you redeem or activate a promotion (which may be included in a coupon, gift card or Evernote Points), we use this information to process such promotions and to provide account verification support if you’re having difficultly accessing your Evernote Service account. In addition, when you use your device to access our Service, your device provides a unique identifier that we combine with a human-readable description of the device (e.g., “My iPad”) in order to show you (on your account’s Access History page) which applications are authorized to access your Evernote Service account and date of last access. The device identifier varies by platform. We also use this information to calculate anonymous, aggregate statistics on the number of unique devices using the Evernote Service.

Evernote’s web site and applications also collect and receive information from your computer or mobile device, including the activities you perform within your account, the type of hardware and software you are using (for example, your operating system or browser), and information obtained from cookies (see our Cookie Information Page for more information). When you access the Evernote Service or Evernote Market via an Evernote Software application, that application will request access to certain information on your computing device. For more information on these application permissions, please visit our Data Usage page.

Gathering this kind of information helps us administer the Service and the Evernote Market, provide convenient and personalized user access, improve the features and usability of our products and Service, analyze user trends and information about users’ use of our Service (including the extent to which our users share or make public notes and notebooks), collect information about use and growth of the Service in specific regions, and evaluate the content and organization of our site.

When you use our Web Clipper or Clearly browser extensions to view and/or save content from third-party websites, we will keep a record of the source website for you. This source-recording functionality will not be affected by your browser’s do-not-track settings.

In addition, we automatically gather non-personally identifiable information that indicates your association with one of our business partners or certain promotions. We use this information to determine the amount of revenue share payments to make to partners with whom we might have such arrangements and to provide anonymized aggregate reports.

Once we receive your data, we protect it on our servers using a combination of administrative, physical and logical security safeguards. The security of the information stored locally in the Evernote Software installed on your computing device requires that you make use of the security features of your device.

Evernote also provides users with the ability to encrypt segments of text within any given note. You can learn how to encrypt text by reviewing this Knowledge Base article. Please note, however, that Evernote does not have the ability to decrypt encrypted contents, so we won’t be able to help you recover encrypted contents if you forget the passphrase you used for encryption.

If Evernote learns of a security system breach, we may attempt to notify you and provide information on protective steps, if available, through the email address that you have provided to us or by posting a notice on our web site. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive such notices in writing.
