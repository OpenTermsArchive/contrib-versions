Some third parties’ embedded content or plugins on the Service, such as Facebook “Like” buttons on Evernote.com, may allow their operators to learn that you have visited our website, and they may combine this information with other, identifiable information they have collected about your visits to other websites or online services.

Does Evernote Access or Review My Notes?

As a rule, Evernote employees do not monitor or view your personal information or Content stored in the Service, but it may be viewed if we believe our Terms of Service have been violated and confirmation is required, if we need to do so in order to respond to your requests for support, or we otherwise determine that we have an obligation to review it as described in our Terms of Service. Your Notes also may be viewed where necessary to protect the rights, property or personal safety of Evernote and its users, or in order to comply with our legal obligations, such as responding to warrants, court orders or other legal process. We vigilantly protect the privacy of your account contents and, whenever we determine it possible, we provide you with notice if we believe we are compelled to comply with a third party’s request for information about your account. Please visit our Information for Authorities page for more information

The Evernote Service utilizes technologies to show you Notes and Content that relate to the specific activities you perform when using Evernote applications. For example, if you turn on “Related Results” in our Web Clipper (it’s on by default for our Business users) or if you have “Related Notes” enabled in your Evernote account (it’s on by default in applications where the feature is offered), Evernote will automatically include Notes you have access to in Evernote and display them with the search engine results in your browser or below the Note you are viewing in your account. The Notes displayed may include Notes from your own account, Notes from accounts you are connected to through Evernote Business, and third party content that you have elected to receive. We believe features like these, which work automatically without any person reviewing your Content, will enhance your experience using the Service.

In addition, by detecting certain actions you take in your account (such as emailing Content into your account) or specific attributes associated with your Notes (such as whether your Notes contain PDFs or image files, or which application you use to create Notes), we may suggest Evernote Products or Service features to you that we think will help you get the most out of our Service. We do not read or share the Contents of your Notes with anyone for any advertising purposes.

Does Evernote Ever Make Any of My Personal Information or Content Public?

No. Note, however, that certain portions of the Evernote web sites and Service, such as user notebooks designated as “public” and our user forum, are open to any online viewer. Any information that you post in these locations can be read, collected and used by anyone and could enable others to send you unsolicited messages. Evernote enables you to determine whether or not to post personal or otherwise sensitive information to publicly accessible areas of our site, so you should carefully consider how you use the Service. Evernote is not responsible for any publication or use of any Personal Information you choose to post in these locations.

III. Data Storage and Transfer Where Is My Data Stored?

When you use Evernote Software on your computing device, such as by using one of our downloadable clients, Content you save will be stored locally on that device. When you sync your computing device with the Service, that Content will be replicated on our servers, which are located in the United States.

Please be aware that Personal Information and Content submitted to Evernote will be transferred to a data center in the United States. If you post information to the Evernote sites you are confirming your consent to such information, including Personal Information and Content, being hosted and accessed in the United States.

Data privacy laws or regulations in your home country may differ from those in the United States, but Evernote complies with the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information collected not only from those users residing in the European Union and Switzerland, but from all our users. We have certified that we adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor programs, and to view our certification page, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/.

How Secure Is My Data?

Evernote is committed to protecting the security of your information and takes reasonable precautions to protect it. We use industry standard encryption to protect your data in transit. This is commonly referred to as transport layer security (“TLS”) or secure socket layer (“SSL”) technology. However, Internet data transmissions, cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and as a result, we cannot ensure the security of information during its transmission between you and us. accordingly, you acknowledge that you do so at your own risk.

Once we receive your data, we protect it on our servers using a combination of administrative, physical and logical security safeguards. The security of the information stored locally in the Evernote Software installed on your computing device is dependent upon you making use of the security features on your device. We recommend that you take the appropriate steps to secure all computing devices that you use with our applications and Service.

Evernote also provides you with the ability to encrypt segments of text within any given note. You can learn how to encrypt text by reviewing this Knowledge Base article. Please note, however, that Evernote does not have the ability to decrypt encrypted contents, so we won’t be able to help you recover encrypted contents if you forget the passphrase you used for encryption.

If Evernote learns of a security system breach, we may attempt to notify you and provide information on protective steps, if available, through the email address that you have provided to us or by posting a notice on our web site. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive such notices in writing.

IV. Information Deletion What Happens If I Want to Stop Using Evernote?

You can delete Content you have posted to any notebook at any time, and you can stop using the Evernote Service at any time. If you delete information and material from a notebook and then sync your account, it will no longer be accessible to you or others who may access the Service, but residual copies of your deleted Content may continue to exist on the Evernote Service’s back-up and archiving systems for up to one year due to the nature of those systems’ operations. If you deactivate your account, the Content in your account will not be deleted unless you purposely delete that information, and sync your account before you deactivate your account. Learn how to delete your Content hereLearn how to delete your Content on our privacy section's Delete Data page.
