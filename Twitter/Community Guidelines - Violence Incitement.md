Glorification of violence policy
================================

### Overview 

**March 2019**

**You may not threaten violence against an individual or a group of people. We also prohibit the glorification of violence.**

Glorifying violent acts could inspire others to take part in similar acts of violence. Additionally, glorifying violent events where people were targeted on the basis of their protected characteristics (including: race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease) could incite or lead to further violence motivated by hatred and intolerance. For these reasons, we have a policy against content that glorifies acts of violence in a way that may inspire others to replicate those violent acts and cause real offline harm, or events where members of a protected group were the primary targets or victims.  
  

### What is in violation of this policy? 

Under this policy, you can’t glorify, celebrate, praise or condone violent crimes, violent events where people were targeted because of their membership in a protected group, or the perpetrators of such acts. We define glorification to include praising, celebrating, or condoning statements, such as “I’m glad this happened”, “This person is my hero”, “I wish more people did things like this”, or “I hope this inspires others to act”. 

Violations of this policy include, but are not limited to, glorifying, praising, condoning, or celebrating:

*   violent acts committed by civilians that resulted in death or serious physical injury, e.g., murders, mass shootings;
*   attacks carried out by terrorist organizations or violent extremist groups (as defined by [our terrorism and violent extremism policy](https://help.twitter.com/rules-and-policies/violent-groups)); and
*   violent events that targeted protected groups, e.g., the Holocaust, Rwandan genocide.   
     

### What is not a violation of this policy? 

Our focus is on preventing the glorification of violence that could inspire others to replicate violent acts, as well as violent events where protected groups were the primary targets or victims. Exceptions may be made for violent acts by state actors, where violence was not primarily targeting protected groups.
