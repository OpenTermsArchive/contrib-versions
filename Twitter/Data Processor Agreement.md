Additional information about data processing
============================================

**This supplements the [Twitter Privacy Policy](https://twitter.com/privacy) to provide additional information about the types of data we collect, where we get it, and how we process and share it.** 

### Data processing summary 

The table below contains a list of the general purposes for which we process personal data. For data from the European Union, EFTA States, and the United Kingdom, the third column in the table below contains the primary legal bases we rely on for such processing. 

Some processing activities may be accounted for in multiple rows if the processing or data involved is sufficiently distinct. For example, advertising revenues allow us to support and improve our services. To provide this advertising we process some of your data, and for data from the European Union, EFTA States, and the United Kingdom we rely on legitimate interests as the legal basis for doing so. We also offer you the ability to further personalize the ads you see based on data we receive about you from our advertising partners. If you are located in the European Union, an EFTA State, or the United Kingdom, we rely on consent as our legal basis for processing your data to provide these ads.

\* We do not collect Twitter for Web data from browsers that we believe to be located in the European Union or the European Economic Area.

† We set and use cookies as described in [Our use of cookies and similar technologies](https://help.twitter.com/rules-and-policies/twitter-cookies), and if you are in the European Union, an EFTA State, or the United Kingdom with your consent as provided for under Directive 95/46/EC.

❖Twitter also shares non-public personal information with advertisers that are not acting as data processors in order to enable those advertisers to measure their own advertising. As described above, Twitter treats such partnerships as consent-based data processing and Twitter customers located in the European Union, an EFTA state, or the United Kingdom must have their  “Allow additional information sharing with business partners” setting enabled in order for Twitter and its data processors to share their non-public personal information with non-data-processors in such circumstances.

### Legitimate interests analysis summary – inferences about your account 

Twitter uses information that individuals provide and data that it receives (as described in Twitter’s Privacy Policy) to make inferences about the people who use Twitter and content on the platform. This includes inferences like what [topics](https://help.twitter.com/using-twitter/follow-and-unfollow-topics) people may be interested in, how old a person is, what languages a person speaks, and whether the content of one account may be of interest to others on the platform. This helps Twitter offer better services and personalize the content Twitter shows, including ads.

Without these inferences, people would have a harder time finding content that interested them, Twitter would have a more difficult time keeping the platform safe and enjoyable for everyone, and Twitter’s advertising would be less compelling to those who saw it and less valuable to Twitter’s business customers.

To safeguard the rights of those who use our services, if an individual wishes to review and modify information that Twitter has inferred about them, that individual may do so by using [Your Twitter data](https://help.twitter.com/managing-your-account/accessing-your-twitter-data). This service is available both to individuals with a Twitter account and those who do not have an account or are logged out of Twitter.   
 

### Legitimate interests analysis summary – advertising we show you on Twitter based on data you provide or we collect on Twitter, or on other websites or mobile apps based on information collected there 

Twitter uses information that individuals provide and data that it receives during the individual’s use of Twitter (as described in Twitter’s Privacy Policy) to improve the quality of the ads the individual sees on the platform. When Twitter shows ads in other apps or websites, Twitter uses information from that app or website to improve the quality of the ads the individual sees.

This enables Twitter to give individuals a better product experience that is more in line with their interests and the content they find most meaningful and relevant to them, and to provide more valuable advertising offerings that generate revenue to support and improve its services. Without this processing, Twitter’s advertising would be less compelling to those who saw it and less valuable to Twitter’s business customers.

To safeguard the rights of those who use our services, Twitter offers individuals a variety of controls over the ads they see on Twitter.  Individuals may block or mute specific advertisers if they do not wish to see ads from those advertisers, report bad or offensive ads, and flag ads that they do not like. In addition, every ad on Twitter provides a dropdown “Why am I seeing this ad?” option to let the individual see the basis on which the ad was shown to them, such as inferred age, gender, and interests. The individual may then modify that information in [Your Twitter data](https://help.twitter.com/managing-your-account/accessing-your-twitter-data) to affect future ads that they see. This service is available both to individuals with a Twitter account and those who do not have an account or are logged out of Twitter.  
 

### Legitimate interests analysis summary – Measuring the effectiveness of advertising we show you 

Twitter uses information that individuals provide and data that it receives (as described in Twitter’s Privacy Policy) to measure the effectiveness of the advertising Twitter shows to individuals. 

This enables Twitter to give advertisers a means of better understanding the performance of the advertising they purchase through Twitter. Such advertising measurement offerings are a critical component of Twitter’s business because they enable advertisers to make informed decisions about what kinds of advertisements they should run, when they should run them, what kinds of content they should include, and the audiences they should try to reach. Without this processing, Twitter’s advertising would be less compelling to those who saw it and less valuable to Twitter’s business customers.

To safeguard the rights of those who use our services, Twitter primarily offers advertising measurement through data processor partnerships that generate reports for advertisers about key performance indicators of their Twitter advertising campaigns. These data processors are subject to a number of contractual restrictions around how they are permitted to process data received from Twitter, including that they are prohibited from sharing with third parties that are not acting as data processors any Twitter data that by itself can be used to identify an individual. 

Twitter also shares non-public personal information with advertisers that are not acting as data processors in order to enable those advertisers to measure their own advertising. As described above, Twitter treats such partnerships as consent-based data processing and Twitter customers located in the European Union, an EFTA state, or the United Kingdom must have their  “Allow additional information sharing with business partners” setting enabled in order for Twitter and its data processors to share their non-public personal information with non-data-processors in such circumstances.  
 

### Legitimate interests analysis summary – enabling advertisers to exclude an advertiser-submitted audience from being eligible for an advertising campaign 

Twitter uses information that individuals provide and data that it receives (as described in Twitter’s Privacy Policy) to enable advertisers to exclude an advertiser-submitted audience from being eligible for an advertising campaign. 

This enables Twitter to give advertisers a way to avoid showing their ads to people who are irrelevant to the goals of their campaigns (e.g., people who have already installed the advertiser’s game). This feature is a critical component of Twitter’s business because it helps Twitter serve fewer irrelevant ads and enables Twitter advertisers to effectively run advertising campaigns at scale while reducing bad user experiences with irrelevant ads and wasting money serving ads to users who have already taken the action being advertised. Without this processing, Twitter’s advertising would be less compelling to those who saw it and less valuable to Twitter’s business customers, some of whom would not run advertising campaigns on Twitter at all.

To safeguard the rights of those who use our services, Twitter implements technical measures, contracts, and policies to disclose this processing, separate out the personal data processed only for this purpose, minimize the amount and type of personal data processed for this purpose, and avoid processing of personal data based on categories that may be sensitive or are prohibited by law, such as race, religion, politics, sex life, or health.  
 

### Legitimate interests analysis summary – non-service related notifications about your Twitter activity, related content, Direct Messages, and other Twitter product features 

Twitter uses information that individuals provide and data that it receives (as described in Twitter’s Privacy Policy) to send non-service related notifications to Twitter account holders about their Twitter activity, related content, Direct Messages, and other Twitter product features. This enables Twitter to provide information that individuals may find valuable or useful, such as Tweets or Direct Messages directed to the individual, analytics about content the individual authored, and new product features.

Without these notifications, people would have a harder time learning of content relevant to them on Twitter, would receive less feedback about their content on Twitter, and would potentially miss out on conversations with others on Twitter.

To safeguard the rights of those who use our services, each non-service related email notification contains an opt out link that enables the individual to disable any or all such notifications. An individual can similarly update his or her preferences at any time while logged into Twitter.com or our mobile apps. For individuals in the European Union, an EFTA State, and the United Kingdom, control is also provided during the registration process in which the individual’s email address is first collected.
