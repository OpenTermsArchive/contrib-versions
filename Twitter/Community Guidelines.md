**You may not misappropriate the identity of individuals, groups, or organizations or use a fake identity to deceive others.**
==============================================================================================================================

We want X to be a place where people can find authentic voices. While you are not required to display your real name or image on your profile, your account should not use false profile information to represent itself as a person or entity that is not affiliated with the account owner, such that it may mislead others who use X.

We prohibit the following behaviors under this policy:

**Impersonation  
**

You may not pose as an existing person, group, or organization to mislead others about who you are or who you represent. Accounts that violate this policy will misrepresent their identity by using **at least two elements** of another identity, such as the name, image, or false claims of affiliation with another individual or organization in their profile or posts.

**Deceptive Identities**

You may not pose as someone who doesn’t exist to mislead others about who you are or who you represent. This includes using at least one element of someone else's identity on your profile or posts in a misleading way, such as using another individual’s image or making a false statement of affiliation with an existing individual or entity. We also consider accounts to be deceptive if they use a computer generated image of a person to pose as someone who doesn’t exist.

We believe giving people choice in terms of how they represent themselves online enables them to express themselves and control their privacy. X allows the use of pseudonymous accounts, meaning an account’s profile is not required to use the name or image of the account owner. Accounts that appear similar to others on X are not in violation of this policy, so long as their purpose is not to deceive or manipulate others. Accounts that share your name but have no other commonalities are not in violation of this policy.

**Parody, Commentary, or Fan Accounts**

Accounts that depict another person, group, or organization in their profile to discuss, satirize, or share information about that entity are not in violation of this policy. While these accounts may use elements of another’s identity, they also include profile language or other indicators that inform people on X that the account is not affiliated with the subject of the profile.

To avoid confusing others about an account’s affiliation, Parody, Commentary, and Fan accounts must distinguish themselves in their account name and in their bio. Accounts that fail to sufficiently distinguish themselves are considered non-compliant and in violation of this policy.

* **Account name:** The account name should clearly indicate that the account is not affiliated with the subject portrayed in the profile. Accounts can indicate this by incorporating words such as, but not limited to, "parody," "fake," "fan," or "commentary.” This language should be stated in a way that can be understood by any audience and should not be contradicted by other affiliation terminology such as “official.” Please note, an account name is separate from the username (i.e. @handle).
* **Bio:** The bio should clearly state that the account is not affiliated with the subject portrayed in the profile. Non-affiliation can be indicated by incorporating words such as, but not limited to, “not affiliated with,” "parody," "fake," "fan," or "commentary.” This language should be stated in a way that can be understood by any audience.

If you believe an account is posing as you or your brand, you can file a report [here](https://help.twitter.com/forms/impersonation). If you believe an account is using a deceptive fake identity or misusing the identity of somebody else, you can flag it as a bystander by [reporting](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-report-violation.html) directly from the account’s profile.

In cases where an account is suspected of misusing a specific individual or entity’s identity, we may need more information to determine whether the account is run or authorized by the entity portrayed in the profile. To ensure we have enough context, we may need a report from the portrayed party in order to take action.

The consequences for violating the policy depend on the severity and type of violation, as well as an account’s history of previous violations. The actions we take may include the following:

**Profile modifications**

If your account is potentially confusing in terms of its affiliation, including as a non-compliant parody, commentary or fan account, we may require you to edit the content on your profile. If you violate this policy again after your first warning, your account may be suspended.

**Suspension**  

If you are engaged in impersonation or are using a deceptive identity, we may suspend your account. If we believe you may be in violation of this policy, we may require you to provide government issued identification (such as a driver’s license or passport) in order to reinstate your account.   

If you believe that your account was locked or suspended in error, you can [submit an appeal](https://help.twitter.com/forms/general?subtopic=suspended).

To report an account that may be misusing your trademark, please see our [trademark policy.](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-trademark-policy.html) For information about our spam rules, you can read more on our [platform manipulation and spam](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/platform-manipulation.html) policy. You may submit feedback using this [form](https://help.twitter.com/en/twitter-for-you).
