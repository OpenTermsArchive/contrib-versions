The Twitter Rules
=================

Twitter's purpose is to serve the public conversation. Violence, harassment and other similar types of behavior discourage people from expressing themselves, and ultimately diminish the value of global public conversation. Our rules are to ensure all people can participate in the public conversation freely and safely.  
 

### Safety

  
Violence: You may not threaten violence against an individual or a group of people. We also prohibit the glorification of violence.
