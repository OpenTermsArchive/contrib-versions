Non-consensual nudity policy
============================

[Take the survey](https://www.research.net/r/QFBQSNC)

### Overview

**  
December 2021**

**You may not post or share intimate photos or videos of someone that were produced or distributed without their consent.**

Sharing explicit sexual images or videos of someone online without their consent is a severe violation of their privacy and the [X Rules](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules.html). Sometimes referred to as revenge porn, this content poses serious safety and security risks for people affected and can lead to physical, emotional, and financial hardship.  
  

### What is a violation of this policy?

  
Under this policy, you can’t post or share explicit images or videos that were taken, appear to have been taken or that were shared without the consent of the people involved.

Examples of the types of content that violate this policy include, but are not limited to:  

* hidden camera content featuring nudity, partial nudity, and/or sexual acts;
* creepshots or upskirts - images or videos taken of people’s buttocks, up an individual’s skirt/dress or other clothes that allows people to see the person’s genitals, buttocks, or breasts; 
* images or videos that superimpose or otherwise digitally manipulate an individual’s face onto another person’s nude body; 
* images or videos that are taken in an intimate setting and not intended for public distribution; and
* offering a bounty or financial reward in exchange for intimate images or videos.  
     

### What is not a violation of this policy?

  
Pornography and other forms of consensually produced adult content are allowed on X, provided that this media is marked as sensitive. Doing so provides people who may not want to see this type of content with a warning that they will need to acknowledge before viewing your media. 

To mark your media as sensitive, navigate to your [safety settings](https://twitter.com/settings/safety) and select the **Mark media you post as containing material that may be sensitive** option. If you don’t mark your media as sensitive, we may do so manually if your content is reported for review.   
  

### Who can report violations of this policy?

  
Because X allows some types of adult content, we need to evaluate context to assess if reported content has been created or shared without the consent of those involved.   
 

**Content reportable by anyone**

We recognize that it can be difficult for those impacted to report this type of content for review. To reduce the burden on those affected, anyone can report the following types of content:

* creepshots or upskirts;
* content where a bounty or financial reward is offered in exchange for non-consensual nudity media; and
* intimate images or videos that are accompanied by:
* text that wishes/hopes for harm to come to those depicted or otherwise refers to revenge e.g., “I hope you get what you deserve when people see this”; and
* information that could be used to contact those depicted e.g., “You can tell my ex what you think by calling them on 1234567”.  
     

**Content reportable by featured individual(s)**

For other types of content, we may need to hear directly from the individual(s) featured (or an authorized representative, such as a lawyer) to ensure that we have sufficient context before taking any enforcement action.

### What happens if you violate this policy?

  
We will **immediately and permanently suspend any account that we identify as the original poster of intimate media** that was created or shared without consent. We will do the same with any account that posts only this type of content, e.g., accounts dedicated to sharing upskirt images.

In other cases, we may not suspend an account immediately. This is because some people share this content inadvertently, to express shock, disbelief or to denounce this practice. In these cases, we will require you to remove this content. We will also temporarily lock you out of your account before you can post again. If you violate this policy again after your first warning, your account will be permanently suspended. If you believe that your account was suspended in error, you can [submit an appeal](https://help.twitter.com/en/forms/account-access/appeals.html).

Non-consensual nudity policy
============================

[Take the survey](https://www.research.net/r/QFBQSNC)

### Overview

**  
December 2021**

**You may not post or share intimate photos or videos of someone that were produced or distributed without their consent.**

Sharing explicit sexual images or videos of someone online without their consent is a severe violation of their privacy and the [X Rules](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules.html). Sometimes referred to as revenge porn, this content poses serious safety and security risks for people affected and can lead to physical, emotional, and financial hardship.  
  

### What is a violation of this policy?

  
Under this policy, you can’t post or share explicit images or videos that were taken, appear to have been taken or that were shared without the consent of the people involved.

Examples of the types of content that violate this policy include, but are not limited to:  

* hidden camera content featuring nudity, partial nudity, and/or sexual acts;
* creepshots or upskirts - images or videos taken of people’s buttocks, up an individual’s skirt/dress or other clothes that allows people to see the person’s genitals, buttocks, or breasts; 
* images or videos that superimpose or otherwise digitally manipulate an individual’s face onto another person’s nude body; 
* images or videos that are taken in an intimate setting and not intended for public distribution; and
* offering a bounty or financial reward in exchange for intimate images or videos.  
     

### What is not a violation of this policy?

  
Pornography and other forms of consensually produced adult content are allowed on X, provided that this media is marked as sensitive. Doing so provides people who may not want to see this type of content with a warning that they will need to acknowledge before viewing your media. 

To mark your media as sensitive, navigate to your [safety settings](https://twitter.com/settings/safety) and select the **Mark media you post as containing material that may be sensitive** option. If you don’t mark your media as sensitive, we may do so manually if your content is reported for review.   
  

### Who can report violations of this policy?

  
Because X allows some types of adult content, we need to evaluate context to assess if reported content has been created or shared without the consent of those involved.   
 

**Content reportable by anyone**

We recognize that it can be difficult for those impacted to report this type of content for review. To reduce the burden on those affected, anyone can report the following types of content:

* creepshots or upskirts;
* content where a bounty or financial reward is offered in exchange for non-consensual nudity media; and
* intimate images or videos that are accompanied by:
* text that wishes/hopes for harm to come to those depicted or otherwise refers to revenge e.g., “I hope you get what you deserve when people see this”; and
* information that could be used to contact those depicted e.g., “You can tell my ex what you think by calling them on 1234567”.  
     

**Content reportable by featured individual(s)**

For other types of content, we may need to hear directly from the individual(s) featured (or an authorized representative, such as a lawyer) to ensure that we have sufficient context before taking any enforcement action.

To mark your media as sensitive, navigate to your [safety settings](https://twitter.com/settings/safety) and select the **Mark media you post as containing material that may be sensitive** option. If you don’t mark your media as sensitive, we may do so manually if your content is reported for review.   
  

### Who can report violations of this policy?

  
Because X allows some types of adult content, we need to evaluate context to assess if reported content has been created or shared without the consent of those involved.   
 

**Content reportable by anyone**

We recognize that it can be difficult for those impacted to report this type of content for review. To reduce the burden on those affected, anyone can report the following types of content:

* creepshots or upskirts;
* content where a bounty or financial reward is offered in exchange for non-consensual nudity media; and
* intimate images or videos that are accompanied by:
* text that wishes/hopes for harm to come to those depicted or otherwise refers to revenge e.g., “I hope you get what you deserve when people see this”; and
* information that could be used to contact those depicted e.g., “You can tell my ex what you think by calling them on 1234567”.  
     

**Content reportable by featured individual(s)**

For other types of content, we may need to hear directly from the individual(s) featured (or an authorized representative, such as a lawyer) to ensure that we have sufficient context before taking any enforcement action.

Non-consensual nudity policy
============================

[Take the survey](https://www.research.net/r/QFBQSNC)

### Overview

**  
December 2021**

**You may not post or share intimate photos or videos of someone that were produced or distributed without their consent.**

Sharing explicit sexual images or videos of someone online without their consent is a severe violation of their privacy and the [X Rules](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules.html). Sometimes referred to as revenge porn, this content poses serious safety and security risks for people affected and can lead to physical, emotional, and financial hardship.  
  

### What is a violation of this policy?

  
Under this policy, you can’t post or share explicit images or videos that were taken, appear to have been taken or that were shared without the consent of the people involved.

Examples of the types of content that violate this policy include, but are not limited to:  

* hidden camera content featuring nudity, partial nudity, and/or sexual acts;
* creepshots or upskirts - images or videos taken of people’s buttocks, up an individual’s skirt/dress or other clothes that allows people to see the person’s genitals, buttocks, or breasts; 
* images or videos that superimpose or otherwise digitally manipulate an individual’s face onto another person’s nude body; 
* images or videos that are taken in an intimate setting and not intended for public distribution; and
* offering a bounty or financial reward in exchange for intimate images or videos.  
     

### What is not a violation of this policy?

  
Pornography and other forms of consensually produced adult content are allowed on X, provided that this media is marked as sensitive. Doing so provides people who may not want to see this type of content with a warning that they will need to acknowledge before viewing your media. 

To mark your media as sensitive, navigate to your [safety settings](https://twitter.com/settings/safety) and select the **Mark media you post as containing material that may be sensitive** option. If you don’t mark your media as sensitive, we may do so manually if your content is reported for review.   
  

### Who can report violations of this policy?

  
Because X allows some types of adult content, we need to evaluate context to assess if reported content has been created or shared without the consent of those involved.   
 

**Content reportable by anyone**

We recognize that it can be difficult for those impacted to report this type of content for review. To reduce the burden on those affected, anyone can report the following types of content:

* creepshots or upskirts;
* content where a bounty or financial reward is offered in exchange for non-consensual nudity media; and
* intimate images or videos that are accompanied by:
* text that wishes/hopes for harm to come to those depicted or otherwise refers to revenge e.g., “I hope you get what you deserve when people see this”; and
* information that could be used to contact those depicted e.g., “You can tell my ex what you think by calling them on 1234567”.  
     

**Content reportable by featured individual(s)**

For other types of content, we may need to hear directly from the individual(s) featured (or an authorized representative, such as a lawyer) to ensure that we have sufficient context before taking any enforcement action.

### What happens if you violate this policy?

  
We will **immediately and permanently suspend any account that we identify as the original poster of intimate media** that was created or shared without consent. We will do the same with any account that posts only this type of content, e.g., accounts dedicated to sharing upskirt images.

In other cases, we may not suspend an account immediately. This is because some people share this content inadvertently, to express shock, disbelief or to denounce this practice. In these cases, we will require you to remove this content. We will also temporarily lock you out of your account before you can post again. If you violate this policy again after your first warning, your account will be permanently suspended. If you believe that your account was suspended in error, you can [submit an appeal](https://help.twitter.com/en/forms/account-access/appeals.html).
