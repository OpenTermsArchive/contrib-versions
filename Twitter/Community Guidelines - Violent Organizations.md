Violent organizations policy
============================

### Overview

**  
October 2020**

There is no place on Twitter for violent organizations, including terrorist organizations, violent extremist groups, or individuals who affiliate with and promote their illicit activities. The violence that these groups engage in and/or promote jeopardizes the physical safety and well-being of those targeted. Our assessments under this policy are informed by national and international terrorism designations, as well as our violent extremist group and violent organizations criteria.  
 

**You may not threaten or promote terrorism or violent extremism.** 

Violent extremist groups are those that meet all of the below criteria:  

* identify through their stated purpose, publications, or actions as an extremist group;
* have engaged in, or currently engage in, violence and/or the promotion of violence as a means to further their cause; and
* target civilians in their acts and/or promotion of violence.  
     

**Other violent organizations  
**

Other violent organizations are those that meet all of the below criteria:

* a collection of individuals with a shared purpose; and
* have systematically targeted civilians with violence. 

We examine a group’s activities both on and off Twitter to determine whether they satisfy the above criteria.  
 

### What is in violation of this policy?

  
Under this policy, you can’t affiliate with and promote the illicit activities of a terrorist organization or violent extremist group. Examples of the types of content that violate this policy include, but are not limited to:

* engaging in or promoting acts on behalf of a violent organization;
* recruiting for a violent organization;
* providing or distributing services (e.g., financial, media/propaganda) to further a violent organization’s stated goals; and
* using the insignia or symbol of violent organizations to promote them or indicate affiliation or support.  
     

### What is not a violation of this policy?

  
We may make limited exceptions for groups that have reformed or are currently engaging in a peaceful resolution process, as well as groups with representatives who have been elected to public office through democratic elections. We may also make exceptions related to the discussion of terrorism or extremism for clearly educational or documentary purposes. This policy also doesn’t apply to state or governmental organizations.
