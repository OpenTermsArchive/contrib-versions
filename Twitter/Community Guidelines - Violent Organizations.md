Violent and hateful entities policy
===================================

### Overview

**  
April 2023**

There is no place on Twitter for violent and hateful entities, including (but not limited to) terrorist organizations, violent extremist groups, [perpetrators of violent attacks](https://help.twitter.com/rules-and-policies/perpetrators-of-violent-attacks), or individuals who affiliate with and promote their illicit activities. The violence and hate these entities engage in and/or promote jeopardizes the physical safety of those targeted.

**You may not threaten terrorism and/or violent extremism, nor promote violent and hateful entities.**

Violent entities are those that deliberately target humans or essential infrastructure with physical violence and/or violent rhetoric as a means to further their cause. These include, but are not limited to, terrorist organizations, violent extremist groups, and [perpetrators of violent attacks](https://help.twitter.com/rules-and-policies/perpetrators-of-violent-attacks). 

Hateful entities are those that have systematically and intentionally promoted, supported and/or advocated for [hateful conduct](https://help.twitter.com/rules-and-policies/hateful-conduct-policy), which includes promoting violence or engaging in targeted harassment towards a protected category.
