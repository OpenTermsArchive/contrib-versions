Terms of Service
================

**Effective: November 15, 2024**

Summary of our Terms
--------------------

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) are part of the User Agreement – a legally binding contract governing your use of X. **You should read these Terms of Service (“Terms”) in full, but here are a few key things you should take away:**

* **You will see advertising on the platform:** In exchange for accessing the Services, X and our third-party providers and partners may display advertising to you.
    

* **When posting Content and otherwise using the Services, you must comply with this User Agreement and Applicable Law:** You are responsible for your use of the Services and your Content. You must comply with this User Agreement, its incorporated policies, and all applicable laws.
    

* **You must abide by the Services’ acceptable use terms:** You may not access the Services in any way other than through the currently available, published interfaces that we provide. For example, this means that you cannot scrape the Services without X’s express written permission, try to work around any technical limitations we impose, or otherwise attempt to disrupt the operation of the Services.
    

* **We have broad enforcement rights:** X reserves the right to take enforcement actions against you if you do violate these terms, such as, for example, removing your Content, limiting visibility, discontinuing your access to X, or taking legal action. We may also suspend or terminate your account for other reasons, such as prolonged inactivity, risk of legal exposure, or commercial inviability. 
    

* **There are Intellectual Property Licenses in these Terms:** You retain ownership and rights to any of your Content you post or share, and you provide us with a broad, royalty-free license to make your Content available to the rest of the world and to let others do the same. Conversely, we provide you a license to use the software we provide as part of the Services, such as the X mobile application, solely for the purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services. 
    

* **Your use of the Services is at your own risk:** We provide the Services on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis, and we disclaim all warranties, responsibility, and liability to you or others to the extent permitted by law. You may be exposed to offensive or harmful content posted by other users. The Services may change from time to time, and we may limit or terminate availability of the Services or particular features to you or other users at any time. 
    

* **You have remedies and redress mechanisms, but our liability is limited:** You have a right to terminate this agreement at any time by deactivating your account and discontinuing use of the Services. Note that we will not be liable for certain types of damages as described in the agreement, and in any event, our aggregate liability shall not exceed the greater of $100 USD or the amount you paid us, if any, in the past six months for the Services giving rise to the claim. Further, if you believe that your Content has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, the reporting process is detailed in these Terms. If you are a recipient of the X Service in the European Union, you may challenge certain decisions we make under the Digital Services Act (Regulation (EU) 2022/2065) via our internal process or via out-of-court dispute settlement as described [here](https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/digital-services-act).
    

Please also note that these Terms incorporate our Privacy Policy ([https://x.com/privacy](https://x.com/privacy)) as well as other terms applicable to your use of the Services and your Content. Finally, these Terms may vary depending on where you live, but in any case, you must be at least 13 years old to use X.

**If you live outside the European Union, EFTA States, or the United Kingdom, including if you live in the United States,** the X User Agreement comprises these [Terms of Service](https://x.com/tos), our [Privacy Policy](https://x.com/privacy), [our Rules and Policies](https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies), and all incorporated policies.

**If you live in the European Union, EFTA States, or the United Kingdom,** the X User Agreement comprises these [Terms of Service](https://x.com/tos#intlTerms), our [Privacy Policy](https://x.com/privacy), [our Rules and Policies](https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies), and all incorporated policies.

You can control most communications from the Services. We may need to provide you with certain communications, such as service announcements and administrative messages. These communications are considered part of the Services and your account, and you may not be able to opt-out from receiving them. If you added your phone number to your account and you later change or deactivate that phone number, you must update your account information to help prevent us from communicating with anyone who acquires your old number.

### Your License to Use the Services

We give you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you as part of the Services. This license cannot be assigned, gifted, sold, shared or transferred in any other manner to any other individual or entity without X’s express written consent. This license has the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided on X, in the manner permitted by these Terms.

The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and other countries. Nothing in the Terms gives you a right to use the X name or any of the X trademarks, logos, domain names, other distinctive brand features, and other proprietary rights. All right, title, and interest in and to the Services (excluding Content provided by users) are and will remain our and our licensors' exclusive property. Any feedback, comments, or suggestions you may provide regarding X, or the Services is entirely voluntary and we will be free to use such feedback, comments or suggestions as we see fit and without any obligation to you.

### Misuse of the Services

You also agree not to misuse the Services, for example, by interfering with them or accessing them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You agree that you will not work around any technical limitations in the software provided to you as part of the Services, or reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits. You may not do any of the following while accessing or using the Services: (i) access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the Services, our computer systems, or the technical delivery systems of our providers; (ii) probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or network or breach or circumvent any security or authentication measures; (iii) access or search or attempt to access or search the Services by any means (automated or otherwise) other than through our currently available, published interfaces that are provided by us (and only pursuant to the applicable terms and conditions), unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with us (NOTE: crawling or scraping the Services in any form, for any purpose without our prior written consent is expressly prohibited); (iv) forge any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any email or posting; (v) in any way use the Services to send altered, deceptive or false source-identifying information; (vi) engage in any conduct that violates our [Platform Manipulation and Spam Policy](https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/platform-manipulation) or any other [Rules and Policies](https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies), including our [Misuse of Reporting Features Policy](https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/misuse-of-reporting-features); or (vii) interfere with, or disrupt, (or attempt to do so), the access of any user, host or network, including, without limitation, sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, mail-bombing the Services, or by scripting the creation of Content in such a manner as to interfere with or create an undue burden on the Services. It is also a violation of these Terms to facilitate or assist others in violating these Terms, including by distributing products or services that enable or encourage violation of these Terms.

### Ending These Terms

You may end your legal agreement with us at any time by deactivating your accounts and discontinuing your use of the Services. See [https://help.x.com/managing-your-account/how-to-deactivate-x-account](https://help.x.com/managing-your-account/how-to-deactivate-x-account) for instructions on how to deactivate your account and the Privacy Policy for more information on what happens to your information.

We may suspend or terminate your account or cease providing you with all or part of the Services at any time if we reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these Terms or [our Rules and Policies](https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies), (ii) you create risk or possible legal exposure for us; (iii) your account should be removed due to unlawful conduct; (iv) your account should be removed due to prolonged inactivity; or (v) our provision of the Services to you is no longer commercially viable. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you by the email address associated with your account or the next time you attempt to access your account, depending on the circumstances. To the extent permitted by law, we may also terminate your account or cease providing you with all or part of the Services for any other reason or no reason at our convenience. In all such cases, the Terms shall terminate, including, without limitation, your license to use the Services, except that the following sections shall continue to apply: 2, 3, 5, 6, and the misuse provisions of Section 4 (“Misuse of the Services”). If you believe your account was terminated in error you can file an appeal following the steps found in our [Help Center](https://help.x.com/forms/account-access/appeals) ([https://help.x.com/forms/account-access/appeals](https://help.x.com/forms/account-access/appeals)).

5\. Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability
--------------------------------------------

### The Services are Available "AS-IS"

Your access to and use of the Services or any Content are at your own risk. You understand and agree that the Services are provided to you on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis.

NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER TERMS TO THE CONTRARY, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE X ENTITIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, RELIANCE OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (i) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; (ii) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY USER OR THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; (iii) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICES; OR (iv) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT.

THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SUBSECTION SHALL APPLY TO ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE X ENTITIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS OR USING THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THAT THE X ENTITIES ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR THE ACTIONS OR CONDUCT OF USERS AND THIRD PARTIES ON THE SERVICES, OR FOR ANY CONTENT USERS AND THIRD PARTIES SHARE ON THE SERVICES, INCLUDING OFFENSIVE, DEFAMATORY, ILLEGAL OR OTHER OBJECTIONABLE CONTENT.

### Liquidated Damages

Protecting our users’ data and our system resources is important to us. You further agree that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, if you violate the Terms, or you induce or facilitate others to do so, in addition to all other legal remedies available to us, you will be jointly and severally liable to us for liquidated damages as follows for requesting, viewing, or accessing more than 1,000,000 posts (including reply posts, video posts, image posts, and any other posts) in any 24-hour period - $15,000 USD per 1,000,000 posts. You agree that these amounts are (i) a reasonable estimate of our damages; (ii) not a penalty; and (iii) not otherwise limiting of our ability to recover from you or others under any legal or equitable theory or claim, including but not limited to statutory damages and/or equitable relief. You further agree that repeated violations of these Terms will irreparably harm and entitle us to injunctive and/or other equitable relief, in addition to monetary damages.

6\. General
-----------

We may revise these Terms from time to time. The changes will not be retroactive, and the most current version of the Terms, which will always be at [https://x.com/tos](https://x.com/tos), will govern our relationship with you. We will try to notify you of material revisions, for example via a service notification or an email to the email associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. 

The laws of the State of Texas, excluding its choice of law provisions, will govern these Terms and any dispute that arises between you and us, notwithstanding any other agreement between you and us to the contrary. All disputes related to these Terms or the Services, including without limitation disputes related to or arising from other users’ and third parties’ use of the Services and any Content made available by other users and third parties on the Services, will be brought exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas or state courts located in Tarrant County, Texas, United States, and you consent to personal jurisdiction in those forums and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum. Without prejudice to the foregoing, you agree that, in its sole discretion, X may bring any claim, cause of action, or dispute we have against you in any competent court in the country in which you reside that has jurisdiction and venue over the claim. To the extent permitted by law, you also waive the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action, collective action or representative action proceeding. 

If you are a federal, state, or local government entity in the United States using the Services in your official capacity and legally unable to accept the controlling law, jurisdiction or venue clauses above, then those clauses do not apply to you. For such U.S. federal government entities, these Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the United States of America (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the State of Texas (excluding choice of law).

You and X agree that you must initiate any proceeding or action within one (1) year of the date of the occurrence of the event or facts giving rise to a dispute that is arising out of or related to these Terms. Otherwise, to the extent permitted by applicable law, you forever waive the right to pursue any claim or cause of action, of any kind or character, based on such events or facts, and such claims or causes of action are permanently barred. 

In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.

The X User Agreement is written in English but is made available in multiple languages through translations. X strives to make the translations as accurate as possible to the original English version. However, in case of any discrepancies or inconsistencies, the English language version of the X User Agreement shall take precedence. You acknowledge that English shall be the language of reference for interpreting and constructing the terms of the X User Agreement.

### Your Rights and Grant of Rights in the Content

You retain your rights to any Content you submit, post or display on or through the Services. What’s yours is yours — you own your Content (and your incorporated audio, photos and videos are considered part of the Content).

By submitting, posting or displaying Content on or through the Services, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display, upload, download, and distribute such Content in any and all media or distribution methods now known or later developed, for any purpose. For clarity, these rights include, for example, curating, transforming, and translating. This license authorizes us to make your Content available to the rest of the world and to let others do the same. However, if you have chosen via our features to limit the distribution of your Content to a restricted community, we will respect that choice. You also agree that this license includes the right to analyze text and other information you provide with the view to improve the Services. You agree that this license includes the right for us to (i) provide, promote, and improve the Services, including, for example, for use with and training of our machine learning and artificial intelligence models, whether generative or another type; and (ii) to make Content submitted to or through the Services available to other companies, organizations or individuals, including, for example, for improving the Services and the syndication, broadcast, distribution, repost, promotion or publication of such Content on other media and services, subject to our terms and conditions for such Content use. Such additional uses by us, or other companies, organizations or individuals, is made with no compensation paid to you with respect to the Content that you submit, post, transmit or otherwise make available through the Services as the use of the Services by you is hereby agreed as being sufficient compensation for the Content and grant of rights herein.

We have an evolving set of rules for how ecosystem partners can interact with your Content on the Services. These rules exist to enable an open ecosystem with your rights in mind. You understand that we may modify or adapt your Content as it is distributed, syndicated, published, or broadcast by us and our partners and/or make changes to your Content in order to adapt the Content to different media.

You represent and warrant that you have, or have obtained, all rights, licenses, consents, permissions, power and/or authority necessary to grant the rights granted herein for any Content that you submit, post or display on or through the Services. You agree that such Content will not contain material subject to copyright or other proprietary rights, unless you have necessary permission or are otherwise legally entitled to post the material and to grant us the license described above.

You may need to create an account to use the Services.

We cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above.

You can control most communications from the Services. We may need to provide you with certain communications, such as service announcements and administrative messages. These communications are considered part of the Services and your account, and you may not be able to opt-out from receiving them. If you added your phone number to your account and you later change or deactivate that phone number, you must update your account information to help prevent us from communicating with anyone who acquires your old number.

### Your License to Use the Services

We give you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you as part of the Services. This license cannot be assigned, gifted, sold, shared or transferred in any other manner to any other individual or entity without X’s express written consent. This license has the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided on X, in the manner permitted by these Terms.

The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and other countries.

It is also a violation of these Terms to facilitate or assist others in violating these Terms, including by distributing products or services that enable or encourage violation of these Terms.

### Ending These Terms

We may suspend or terminate your account or cease providing you with all or part of the Services at any time if we reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these Terms or [our Rules and Policies](https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies); (ii) you create risk or possible legal exposure for us; (iii) your account should be removed due to unlawful conduct; (iv) your account should be removed due to prolonged inactivity; or (v) our provision of the Services to you is no longer commercially viable.

If you believe your account was terminated in error you can file an appeal following the steps found in our [Help Center](https://help.x.com/forms/account-access/appeals) ([https://help.x.com/forms/account-access/appeals](https://help.x.com/forms/account-access/appeals)).

6\. General
-----------

We may revise these Terms from time to time. The changes will not be retroactive, and the most current version of the Terms, which will always be at [https://x.com/tos](https://x.com/tos), will govern our relationship with you. Other than for changes addressing new functions or made for legal reasons, we will notify you 30 days in advance of making effective changes to these Terms that impact the rights or obligations of any party to these Terms, for example via a service notification or an email to the email associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.

To the extent permitted by law, all disputes related to these Terms or the Services, including without limitation disputes related to or arising from other users’ and third parties’ use of the Services and any Content made available by other users and third parties on the Services, will be brought exclusively before a competent court in Ireland without regard to conflict of law provisions and will be governed by Irish law, notwithstanding any other agreement between you and us to the contrary. Without prejudice to the foregoing, you agree that, in its sole discretion, X may bring any claim, cause of action, or dispute we have against you in any competent court in the country in which you reside that has jurisdiction and venue over the claim. To the extent permitted by law, you also waive the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action, collective action or representative action proceeding.  
  
You and X agree that you must initiate any proceeding or action within one (1) year of the date of the occurrence of the event or facts giving rise to a dispute that is arising out of or related to these Terms. Otherwise, to the extent permitted by applicable law, you forever waive the right to pursue any claim or cause of action, of any kind or character, based on such events or facts, and such claims or causes of action are permanently barred. 

In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.

The X User Agreement is written in English but is made available in multiple languages through translations. X strives to make the translations as accurate as possible to the original English version. However, in case of any discrepancies or inconsistencies, the English language version of the X User Agreement shall take precedence. You acknowledge that English shall be the language of reference for interpreting and constructing the terms of the X User Agreement.
