TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT
-------------------------------

When you use CBS Services, we collect a few different types, or “categories,” of information. This information generally falls within three broad categories: (a) the information you provide to us, (b) the information we collect automatically when you use our services, and (c) information we obtain from other sources. We describe this information, and the primary purpose for which it is used, below. The full description of how we use the personal information we collect is also provided below.

### Information You Provide To Us

CBS Services collects information you provide to us, including:

*   **Registration Information.** _When you register for certain services, complete any application form, or enter contests or competitions, we sometimes ask you for your name, email address, postal address, demographic information, and any preferences that you may have (e.g., which newsletters you would like to receive). We use this to provide access to certain CBS Services, personalize them, and remember your preferences._
    
*   **Billing and Payment Information.** _When you place an order with us or access a particular service, we will collect certain payment and identity verification information, including your name, email address, and credit card information. We use this to bill you for your use of the CBS Services._
    
*   **Information You Post on the CBS Services.** _We collect personal information from you when you provide or post information to our Services, including your user name, comments, likes, interests, status, pictures and references to your online presence. We make this information available to others, as you request._

We use this to provide services to you and to learn about your interests and concerns._
    
*   **Information You Provide About Others.** _Sometimes, you may provide information about others — for example, to refer a friend to certain CBS Services. We use this to make the CBS Services available to the people you refer._
    
*   **Information you Provide Offline.** _You might also provide personal information to us in person and offline. You may be recorded if you visit our offices (including by security surveillance of our premises, including CCTV), or attend a live performance or the taping of one of our programs as a member of a studio audience, or, if you submit sweepstakes entrance forms or an application to participate in one of our programs by mail or in person. We use this information to provide services to you, protect our security, and learn about your preferences._
    

### Information Collected Automatically Through Cookies and Other Online Tracking Technologies

*   **Authorized Service Providers.** _We share your contact information with vendors who help us with specialized services, including customer support, email and text message deployment, analytics, marketing, suppression list management and data processing.

You can tell when you are accessing a service or feature offered by a Co-Branded Partner because the Co-Branded Partner’s name will be featured prominently. You may be asked to provide information about yourself to register for a service offered with a Co-Branded Partner. In doing so, you may be providing your information to both us and the Co-Branded Partner. Please note that the Co-Branded Partner’s privacy policy may also apply to its use of your information._
    
*   **Other Persons or Entities.** _With appropriate consent when required, certain CBS Services may share your contact information with third party marketing partners, and they may contact you by email, telephone, postal mail or other common communication methods with marketing and promotional messages about their products or services. Sometimes we will give you the option to receive further communications from one of our advertising partners, for example when we run a competition with that advertiser. When you provide consent to receive communications from that third party advertiser, your personal information will be managed by that third party’s own privacy policy._
