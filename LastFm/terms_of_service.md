**Updated on:** Tuesday 2 June 2015

*   Like most large-scale websites, we have some rules which you need to stick to when you use Last.fm. These rules aren’t just the “blahblahblah-yawn-small print” – these are the legal terms of use and so we recommend you read them carefully so you know what you’ve agreed to.
*   As with all websites, Last.fm, its services and software will change over time, both in terms of the content displayed and the functionality offered. We reserve the right to make those changes, and to change these terms in line with them. Software made available for download by Last.fm remains the property of Last.fm, and we reserve the right to update and change that too.
*   Please don’t reproduce any part of the website or content without our permission.
*   A lot of information and content on Last.fm is provided by third parties – both users and other third parties – and the accuracy and reliability of that information is entirely the responsibility of those parties. Likewise, you may sometimes find links on Last.fm to other websites; Last.fm cannot be held responsible for the content of those sites. Links, like everything else added by members of the Last.fm community, are entirely the responsibility of the individuals who have added them.
*   By using Last.fm, you also agree to our Privacy Policy - please read our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy).
*   If you’ve found content on the website that you own and that you believe is being used without your permission then please read [Section 10](#para10) of these Terms of Use for a detailed description of what to do about it. We take infringement claims very seriously, so provide all the information set out in Section 10 and we will act swiftly to deal with any claims.
*   We have a detailed [Acceptable Use policy](#para6), but much like the [Community Guidelines](/help/guidelines) they boil down into a few fairly simple concepts: play nicely, respect other members of the community and use common sense. If we believe someone isn’t playing fairly and within the spirit of the guidelines then we’re entitled to ban that user at our sole discretion. We don’t like doing it, but sometimes it’s the most appropriate response.
*   If you enter a competition or use software alongside Last.fm then make sure you read any accompanying Terms and Conditions carefully too, because they may have conditions in addition to this document.
*   When you use Last.fm and all of its software and services, you accept it “as is”. Like human beings, we have the odd fault or two and we’re constantly updating and improving every aspect of Last.fm, ironing out new-found bugs and making subtle changes to things like our recommendation algorithms. As a result, Last.fm should never be considered a “finished product”, and by using Last.fm you accept it – warts and all.
*   Last.fm is based in London – we quite like it here – and this document is to be interpreted in line with the laws governing England and Wales.

At Last.fm, we aim to respect the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that your work (or the work of a third party on whose behalf you are entitled to act) has been copied, used, or made available on or through the Last.fm Website in a way that constitutes copyright infringement of your intellectual property, please provide our copyright agent with a copyright infringement notice (“Notice”) which should include the following written information:

1.  a statement that you have identified material on the Website which infringes your copyright (or infringes the copyright of a third party on whose behalf you are entitled to act, if applicable);

4.  your full name, email address, postal address and telephone number on which you can be contacted;
5.  a statement by you that you have a good-faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorised by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
6.  a statement by you that the information in the Notice is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; and

### 12\. Information You Submit

When you upload Your Upload Information via the Website, you irrevocably grant to Last.fm, its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, and partners, without any credit or compensation to you, a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, unrestricted, irrevocable, royalty-free and fully transferable, assignable and sub-licensable right and licence to use, reuse, modify, adapt, alter, display, archive, publish, sub-license, perform, copy, reproduce, disclose, transmit, communicate to the public, post, sell, translate, create derivative works of, distribute, make and export Your Upload Information (in whole or in part), or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media, software or technology of any kind now known or developed in the future, for any purposes whatsoever including, without limitation, for advertising, marketing, publicity and promotional purposes, such as developing, manufacturing and marketing products and targeted advertisements using such Uploaded Information. You hereby waive any moral rights (or any similar rights in any jurisdiction) you may have in and to any of Your Upload Information, even if such material is altered or changed in a manner not agreeable to you. You agree and understand that Last.fm, its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, and partners are not obligated to use Your Upload Information submitted through the Website or otherwise, and may alternatively choose, in its sole discretion, to discard, refuse to post, limit or block access to Your Uploaded Information without any liability whatsoever.

You acknowledge that the Web Site, through Last.fm, its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, and partners undertakes no obligation to pre-screen Your Upload Information, but that it has the right, in its sole discretion to monitor, modify, transmit over various networks, refuse, move, block access to or remove any of Your Upload Information. You agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any of Your Upload Information including, but not limited to, any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of Your Upload Information. Since Last.fm, its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, and partners may not pre-screen user generated content, you may bear legal responsibility for others' exposure to any offensive indecent or objectionable content in Your Upload Information.
