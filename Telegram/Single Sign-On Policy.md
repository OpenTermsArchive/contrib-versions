### [](#passport)Passport

**Telegram Passport** is a unified authorization method for services that require personal identification. With Telegram Passport, you can upload your documents once, then instantly share your data with services that require real-world ID (finance, ICOs, etc.).

Your identity documents and personal data will be stored in the Telegram cloud using **End-to-End Encryption**. To Telegram, this data is just random gibberish, and we have no access to the information you store in your Telegram Passport. When you share data, it goes directly to the recipient.

> You can find more information about Telegram Passport on our [blog](https://telegram.org/blog/passport).

If you're a developer or owner of a service that requires real-life ID, kindly take a look at [**this manual**](https://core.telegram.org/passport). You can also try requesting Telegram Passport data using [this page](https://core.telegram.org/passport/example).
