#### [](#what-is-not-allowed-on-telegram)What is not allowed on Telegram

To maintain a safe digital environment for all our users, we restrict the following on our public platform:

* **Spam**. We prohibit unsolicited or unwanted advertisement, as well as any form of commercial harassment.
* **Promoting violence**. We prohibit calls for violence, terrorism, soliciting funds for terrorist organizations, etc.
* **Illegal sexual content**. We never allow child sexual abuse materials (CSAM), bestiality, and non-consensual publication of sexual materials.
* **Activities which are recognized as illegal in the majority of countries**. This includes child abuse, selling or offering illegal goods and services (drugs, firearms, forged documents), sharing personal details of others to intimidate or bully them (doxing), etc.

> All examples are illustrative and non-exhaustive.

#### [](#how-we-moderate-content)How we moderate content

To counter abuse of our public platform, we employ a combination of AI-driven and manual moderation for public content, together with processing user reports. We will always favor the least restrictive measure possible to sustain a safe digital environment and decisively address malicious content. While certain limitations may be automatically imposed or lifted, any critical restrictions require approval from a human moderator.

#### [](#what-action-we-can-take)What action we can take

Telegram can temporarily or permanently suspend certain functionality of your account, e.g., your ability to communicate with people that likely don’t know you or to create and participate in public communities. Accounts, bots and communities that engage in impersonation or attempt to defraud other users may be marked with a FAKE or SCAM label, which will be displayed on their public Telegram profile. In case of serious violations, our moderators may block or delete users, bots, posts, channels and groups.

Unless applicable law prevents us, we will notify you of any restrictions applied to your account and guide you on how to possibly remove them. Certain restrictions may be lifted automatically. If we made a mistake, we will lift or update your restriction and inform you accordingly.

#### [](#recommender-systems)Recommender systems

Telegram does not use content recommendation algorithms to amplify trending content or suggest more of what you may like. The Global Search feature only shows results that partially or fully match your query, with channels and groups ranked by subscriber count and verified accounts listed first. Search results from your country are prioritized. Upon subscription to a channel or from its info menu, you can view a list of [channels similar](https://telegram.org/blog/similar-channels#similar-channels) to the one you are viewing, based on shared subscribers.

#### [](#how-to-get-in-touch-with-telegram-as-a-user)How to get in touch with Telegram as a user

To contact Telegram, you can use [@EURegulation](https://t.me/EURegulation) bot. This bot accepts communications from users as a single point of contact under the Digital Services Act.

#### [](#how-to-report-illegal-content)How to report _illegal_ content

You can report content as illegal on [this page](https://telegram.org/dsa-report).

Note that if you report illegal content under the Digital Services Act, you will be prompted to include more details, including your name, contact information and a clear and convincing explanation why the content in question is illegal. We may have to dismiss your report if the information provided by you is insufficient to support it and may suspend the processing of your notices and complaints if you repeatedly submit manifestly unfounded, fraudulent or misleading reports.

#### [](#contact-points-for-competent-authorities-in-eu-countries)Contact points for competent authorities in EU countries

Competent authorities of the EU and EU members willing to contact Telegram under the Digital Services Act can obtain the necessary contact details from European Digital Services Representative (EDSR), Telegram's representative pursuant to Article 13 of the Digital Services Act, registered at Avenue Huart Hamoir 71, 1030 Brussels, Belgium. EDSR can be contacted by email dsa.telegram@edsr.eu, by phone +32 2 216 19 71 or by post. Requests can be accepted in English and French. If you are not a competent EU or EU member authority, your request will not be processed and you will not get a response.

#### [](#average-monthly-active-recipients-of-service-in-the-eu)Average monthly active recipients of service in the EU

Some non-essential elements of the services provided by Telegram may qualify as “online platforms” under the DSA. As of February 2025, these services had significantly fewer than 45 million average monthly active recipients in the EU over the preceding 6 months — which is below the threshold required for designation as a “very large online platform.”
