Telegram Bug Bounty Program
===========================

Telegram welcomes developers and the security research community to audit its services, [code](https://telegram.org/apps#source-code) and [protocol](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto) seeking vulnerabilities or security-related issues.

Security researchers can [submit](#submission) any relevant issues they find at [security@telegram.org](mailto:security@telegram.org). All reports submitted in accordance with the [rules](#rules-and-principles) and [scope](#program-scope) outlined below which result in a change of code or configuration are eligible for bounties, ranging from **$100** to **$100,000** or more, depending on the severity of the issue.

> Telegram's **bug bounty program** has been continuously active [since 2014](https://telegram.org/blog/cryptocontest).

### [](#rules-and-principles)Rules and Principles

Generally speaking, the purpose of Telegram's **bug bounty program** is to improve the safety of our platform thanks to cutting-edge technologies and modern penetration testing techniques. In accordance with this principle, we expect security professionals to employ common sense and to operate in good faith when researching issues – below is a **non-exhaustive** list of rules that always apply:

* Your testing **cannot violate any law**, **disrupt** Telegram's services or **negatively affect** other users in any way.
* Vulnerabilities that are disclosed to the public or to third parties **before they are addressed** are not eligible for our bug bounty program. This includes vulnerability brokers.
* Attempting to gain **physical access** to any of Telegram’s equipment is strictly prohibited.
* Should you be eligible for a prize, you are **responsible for any taxes** and fees depending on your country of residency.
    
* This bounty program is **security-focused** and therefore **does not** cover denial of service or load balancing issues resulting from spam, brute forcing, coordinated DDoS attacks, etc. Consequently, you are **not allowed** to perform any such action on our services.
    

Researchers are welcome to use our dedicated **test environment** if they require it – instructions on how to access it can be found [here](#test-environment).

> Telegram will not take legal action against anyone who responsibly researches and discloses vulnerabilities in accordance with our rules.

### [](#non-qualifying-issues)Non-qualifying issues

Reports should focus on the **security-related** severity and impact of the vulnerability. Below is a non-exhaustive list of issues that generally **do not** qualify for our program.

**1**. Phishing attacks, spam  
**2**. Token or session hijacking as a result of external **malware** on the OS  
**3**. Irrelevant reports from scanners or automated tools  
**4**. Attacks requiring physical access to the user's device  
**5**. Missing cookie flags (HttpOnly, Secure, etc.)  
**6**. Attacks requiring root access to the user's device  
**7**. Clickjacking  
**8**. Non-reproducible vulnerabilities deriving from outdated or reportedly flawed versions of open-source software  
**9**. Vulnerabilities that rely on social engineering to either obtain sensitive credentials or have the user perform an unlikely sequence of actions  
**10**. Presence of banner or version information, SSL/TLS best practices, etc.

> An issue may only be submitted **once**. Duplicate issues submitted by either the same person or multiple people do not qualify – only the first report will be evaluated.

### [](#program-scope)Program Scope

Generally, any **Telegram-owned** or **operated** app, web service, domain, server and protocol that either handles or stores **private user data** is in scope.

Any **unrelated bug** (e.g. usability, interface, etc.) that doesn't impact security in any way is out of scope and should instead be reported on our dedicated public [bug tracking platform](https://bugs.telegram.org/).

#### [](#protocol)Protocol

Telegram relies on **MTProto 2.0**, a protocol specifically designed for **speed and security**. The full technical documentation is available [here](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto). We welcome any reports about vulnerabilities or design flaws in the protocol which could realistically result in **unauthorized access** to user data.

#### [](#applications)Applications

Official Telegram apps are **open source** and support [reproducible builds](https://core.telegram.org/reproducible-builds). **Pre-built executables** can be found [here](https://telegram.org/apps), while the full **source code** for each app is available [here](https://telegram.org/apps#source-code).

#### [](#domains)Domains

Below is a list of **Telegram domains** which can be considered in scope. Third-party domains that integrate Telegram pages or services are **out of scope**. Low-impact issues which don't pose a significant risk and don't fall under our [non-qualifying issues](#non-qualifying-issues) may be in scope but could be awarded a smaller prize.

* telegram.org, \*.telegram.org
* t.me, \*.t.me
* tg.dev, \*.tg.dev
* telegram.me, \*.telegram.me
* \*.telesco.pe
* \*.stel.com
* contest.com
* quiz.directory
* telegra.ph

#### [](#third-party-applications-and-services)Third-Party Applications and Services

Apps developed by **third parties** using the open [Telegram API](https://core.telegram.org/schema), as well as bots running under [Telegram's Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api), can only be considered in scope if the report targets a **vulnerability on our end** (e.g. vulnerable endpoint which poses a security risk).

Issues caused by third-party developers' **malpractice**, **negligence** or **incorrect implementation** of our [Security Guidelines](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/security_guidelines) are **out of scope** and should instead be promptly reported to the relevant developers.

### [](#submission)Submission

If you found an issue which is [in scope](#program-scope), is [eligible](#non-qualifying-issues) and was found in accordance to our [rules](#rules-and-principles), you are welcome to submit it to [security@telegram.org](mailto:security@telegram.org).

We expect all reports to be written in English and to **follow a consistent template**, spacing included:

    # Attack surface: (e.g. my.telegram.org/auth)
    # Severity: (e.g. 7) [Optional, CVSS v3 rating]
    
    ## Description: 
    [Describe the vulnerability briefly here, including its type]
    
    ## Steps to reproduce:
    [1] Step one...
    [2] Step two...
    [n] Finally...
    
    ## Impact:
    [What practical, realistic risk does this vulnerability pose?]
    
    ## Additional details:
    [Tools used, preconditions, media proof, session and timestamps as needed]

##### [](#third-party-bug-bounty-platforms)Third-Party Bug Bounty Platforms

We ask for all submissions and correspondence to be sent **directly** to [security@telegram.org](mailto:security@telegram.org) – Telegram currently does **not** maintain a presence on third-party bug bounty platforms or services.

### [](#prize)Prize

Valid reports that result in a change of code or configuration are eligible for bounties, ranging from **$100** to **$100,000** or more, depending on the severity of the issue. We reserve the right to ultimately determine both the validity and the appropriate compensation for each report at our discretion.

> In general, **app-level changes** can expect bounties ranging from **$100** to **$10,000**. **Protocol-level issues** may be eligible for rewards of up to **$100,000** or more.

#### [](#test-environment)Test Environment

To log in to the **test environment**, use either of the following:

**iOS**: tap 10 times on the Settings icon > Accounts > Login to another account > Test.  
**Telegram Desktop**: open ☰ Settings > Shift + Alt + Right click ‘Add Account’ and select ‘Test Server’.  
**macOS**: click the Settings icon 10 times to open the Debug Menu, ⌘ + click ‘Add Account’ and log in via phone number.

The test environment is **completely separate** from the main environment, so you will need to create a new user account (or a new bot with [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)).

You can send requests to the test [Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) in this format:

`https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/test/METHOD_NAME`

> When working within the test environment, you may use HTTP links without TLS to test Web Apps.
