Telegram is supported by [Pavel Durov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Durov) and his brother Nikolai. Pavel supports Telegram financially and ideologically while Nikolai's input is technological. To make Telegram possible, Nikolai developed a unique custom data protocol, which is open, secure and optimized for work with multiple data-centers. As a result, Telegram combines security, reliability and speed on any network.

The Telegram development team is based in Dubai.

Most of the developers behind Telegram originally come from St. Petersburg, the city famous for its unprecedented number of [highly skilled engineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest#Winners). The Telegram team had to leave Russia due to local IT regulations and has tried a number of locations as its base, including Berlin, London and Singapore.
