**Introduction**

This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand (i) what information we collect from visitors to our websites or through our marketing channels. (ii) how we use such information at LogMeIn, and (iii) the choices you have associated with that information.

When we refer to “LogMeIn,” “we,” “our,” or “us” in this policy, we are referring to LogMeIn, Inc., and its subsidiaries and affiliates, as the “controller” (and/or a “business” under the CCPA) or the equivalent legal construct under applicable law of the information we process when you visit our websites and/or we interact with you through our marketing channels for business purposes. This Privacy Policy covers the digital properties listed here. When we refer to “personal information” in this policy, we are referring to personal data, personally identifiable information, or the equivalent of each under applicable law.

It is important to note that where LogMeIn handles personal information on behalf of or at the direction of its customers through their use of our Services, LogMeIn is the “processor” (and/or “service provider” under the CCPA) or the equivalent legal construct under applicable law of that data and LogMeIn’s use, processing, and handling of such data is done pursuant to the written instructions of its customers in the form of the Terms of Service, Data Processing Addendum, and/or any similar written agreement between the parties. In these cases, our use of information collected through our Service shall be limited to the purpose of providing and operating the Services for our customers. As used herein, the “Service(s)” refers to the applications, services, and websites (marketing and product) provided by LogMeIn. LogMeIn may, from time-to-time, introduce new products and services. To the extent that any new products and/or services affect this Privacy Policy, we will notify you as further described in Section 8 below.

**3\. Analytics, Cookies and Other Web Site Technologies**

LogMeIn continuously improves its websites and Services through the use of various third-party web analytics tools, which help LogMeIn understand how its visitors use its websites, desktop tools, and mobile applications, what they like and dislike, and where they may have run into problems which need to be addressed.

Geolocation and Other Data:

We may utilize precise Geolocation data but only if you specifically opt-in to or permit collection of that data in connection with a particular Service. We also use information such as IP addresses to determine the general geographic locations areas of our visitors. The web beacons used in conjunction with these web analytics tools may gather data such as what browser or operating system a person uses, as well as, domain names, MIME types, and what content, products and services are reviewed or downloaded when visiting or registering for Services at one of our websites or using one of our mobile applications.

Google Analytics and Adobe Marketing Cloud:

We use Google Analytics as described in “How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps.” You can prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics on websites by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on here. We also employ IP address masking, a technique used to truncate IP addresses collected by Google Analytics and store them in an abbreviated form to prevent them from being traced back to individual users. Portions of our website may also use Google Analytics for Display Advertisers including DoubleClick or Dynamic Remarketing which provide interest-based ads based on your visit to this or other websites. You can use Ads Settings to manage the Google ads you see and opt-out of interest-based ads. We also use Adobe Marketing Cloud as described here.

**EU-U.S. and Swiss Privacy Shield**

LogMeIn has self-certified to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss Privacy Shield with respect to Customer Data. For more information, see our Privacy Shield Notice.

**8\. Security**

LogMeIn follows generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received. However, no security measure is perfect. We recommend safeguarding your password, as it is one of the easiest ways you can manage the security of your own account – remember that if you lose control over your password, you may lose control over your personal information.

**9\. International Data Transfers**

LogMeIn is headquartered in the United States of America and maintains a global infrastructure. Information that we collect and maintain may be transferred to, or controlled and processed in, the United States and/or other countries around the world. Although these countries may have different data protection laws to the laws of your country, we will protect the privacy and security of personal information we collect in accordance with this Privacy Policy, regardless of where it is processed or stored. Where LogMeIn processes European Union personal information outside of the European Union in countries not declared to have adequate protections, it does so in compliance with Chapter 5 of the GDPR (e.g., under the E.U.-US and Swiss Privacy Shield Framework(s) and/or Standard Contractual Clauses) and applicable law.

To learn more about the locations where LogMeIn may process your personal information through its affiliated companies or third-party Sub-processors (when LogMeIn acts as a data processor, service provider, and/or the applicable legal equivalent), please visit the Product Resources section of the LogMeIn Trust &. Privacy Center.

**10\. California Privacy Rights**

_California Consumer Privacy Act_

Additionally, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which takes effect on January 1, 2020, is intended to provide California residents with expanded rights to access, delete and control their personal information. Any terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning when used in this Privacy Policy.

For personal information collected by us during the preceding twelve (12) months that is not otherwise subject to an exception, California residents have the right to access and delete their personal information. We will not discriminate against those who exercise their rights. Specifically, if you exercise your rights, we will not deny you access to our Services, charge you different prices for Services or provide you a different level or quality of Services.

The CCPA additionally requires businesses to provide or make available certain disclosures in the event a party sells your personal information to third parties, however because LogMeIn does not receive any personal information as consideration for any Services or other items provided or performed by LogMeIn, these disclosures do not apply. LogMeIn does not collect, retain, share or use any personal information except as necessary for a business purpose pursuant to a written contract (i.e., to provide and operate the Services) and subject to the restrictions specified in Section 1798.140 (v) of the CCPA. Additionally, LogMeIn refrains from taking any action that would cause any transfers of personal information that qualify as "selling personal information" under the CCPA or other similar applicable privacy laws.

California residents may exercise the rights specified in this Privacy Policy or request information from us regarding whether we share certain categories of your personal information with third parties by contacting privacy@logmein.com.

_California Shine the Light_

Residents of the State of California, under California Civil Code § 1798.83, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed personal information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an opt-out or opt-in choice for use of your personal information by third parties (such as advertisers) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.

LogMeIn qualifies for the alternative option. We have a comprehensive privacy statement and provide you with details on how you may either opt-out or opt-in to the use of your personal information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your personal information for marketing purposes during the preceding year.

**11\. Children’s Privacy**

LogMeIn’s webpages are intended for general audiences – we do not seek through this site to gather personal data from or about persons that are sixteen (16) years of age or younger. If you inform us or we otherwise become aware that we have unintentionally received personal information from an individual under the age of sixteen (16), we will delete this information from our records.

**12\. Changes to this Statement/Contact Us**

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes that have a substantive and adverse impact on your privacy, we will provide notice on this website and notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) for your approval prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
