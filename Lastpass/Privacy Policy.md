Your privacy is critically important to us. LastPass has a few guiding principles:

*   We don’t allow you to send LastPass critically important information like your usernames, passwords, account notes, and LastPass master password. instead your LastPass master password is used locally to encrypt the important data that’s sent to us so that no one, including LastPass employees ever can access it.
*   We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
*   We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
*   We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services. (For example: If you choose to store login history, we keep login history, if you choose not to, we don’t)

LastPass operates several websites including LastPass.com. It is LastPass’ policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

Below is our privacy statement which incorporates these goals:

Website Visitors

Like most website operators, LastPass collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. LastPass’ purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how LastPass’ visitors use its website. From time to time, LastPass may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

LastPass also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. LastPass does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to LastPass’ websites choose to interact with LastPass in ways that require LastPass to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that LastPass gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at LastPass.com to provide a user-name and email address. Those who engage in transactions with LastPass are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, LastPass collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with LastPass. LastPass does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

Use of personal data

LastPass may collect aggregated statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, LastPass may monitor the most popular website account on the LastPass.com site. LastPass may display this information publicly or provide it to others. In addition, LastPass may use your behavioral data and other data you provide to LastPass to customize advertisements on its site to its users. In this way we try to keep the majority of our services free. However, LastPass does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

LastPass discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on LastPass’ behalf or to provide services available at LastPass’ websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country. by using LastPass’ websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. LastPass will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, LastPass discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when LastPass believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of LastPass, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an LastPass website and have supplied your email address, LastPass may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with LastPass and our products. We expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. LastPass takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. LastPass uses cookies to help LastPass identify and track visitors, their usage of LastPass website, and their website access preferences. LastPass visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using LastPass’ websites, with the drawback that certain features of LastPass’ websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

Privacy Statement Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, LastPass may change its Privacy Statement from time to time, and in LastPass’ sole discretion. LastPass encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Statement.
