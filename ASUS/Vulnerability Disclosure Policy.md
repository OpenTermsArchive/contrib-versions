ASUS is releasing a firmware update for selected routers. Our most recent firmware update contains enhanced security protections against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure of data, malware, phishing and DDoS attacks.  
  
We strongly encourage you to periodically audit both your equipment and your security procedures, as this will ensure that you will be better protected against unwanted intrusion. As a user of an ASUS router, we advise taking the following actions:

1.  Update your router to the latest firmware. We strongly recommend that you do so as soon as new firmware is released. You will find the latest firmware available for download from the ASUS support page at [https://www.asus.com/support/](https://www.asus.com/support/) or the appropriate product page at [https://www.asus.com/Networking/](https://www.asus.com/Networking/). ASUS has provided a link to new firmware for selected routers at the end of this notice.
2.  Set up separate passwords for your wireless network and router-administration page. Use passwords with a length of at least eight characters, including a mix of capital letters, numbers and symbols. Do not use the same password for multiple devices or services.
3.  Enable ASUS AiProtection, if your router supports this feature. Instructions on how to do this can be found in your router’s manual, or on the relevant ASUS support page, at [https://www.asus.com/Networking/](https://www.asus.com/Networking/).

  
  

Please note that if you choose not to install this new firmware version then, to avoid any potential unwanted intrusion, we strongly recommend that you disable remote access from WAN or AiCloud, and reset your router to its default settings.  
  
If you have already installed the latest firmware version, please disregard this notice.  
  
Should you have any question or concerns, please contact ASUS via our Security Advisory reporting system: [https://www.asus.com/securityadvisory/](https://www.asus.com/securityadvisory/)

11/15/2019 **Important information about ASUSWRT security:** ∇

1.  ASUSWRT is the name of the router’s firmware and web interface. It does not refer to any iOS, iPadOS or Android app.
2.  ASUS engineers performed internal tests on ASUSWRT using simulated data and there wasn’t any real user data involved in the process. The test is now over and the server has been taken offline since.
3.  Any reports alleging the application of real user data during the ASUSWRT test are inaccurate and misleading.

If there are any questions or concerns, please contact ASUS via our Security Advisory reporting system: [https://www.asus.com/securityadvisory/](https://www.asus.com/securityadvisory/)

06/14/2019 **BIOS Update Announcement for ASUS Notebook PCs** ∇

ASUS has released a BIOS update for notebook PCs to ensure a more secure and convenient computing experience. This update only affects users who currently have a password for their BIOS or hard drive. Concerned users with a password should install the new BIOS update via Windows Update or refer to the instruction from [https://www.asus.com/support/FAQ/1040162](https://www.asus.com/support/FAQ/1040162).

ASUS is releasing a firmware update for selected routers. Our most recent firmware update contains enhanced security protections against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure of data, malware, phishing and DDoS attacks.  
  
We strongly encourage you to periodically audit both your equipment and your security procedures, as this will ensure that you will be better protected against unwanted intrusion. As a user of an ASUS router, we advise taking the following actions:

1.  Update your router to the latest firmware. We strongly recommend that you do so as soon as new firmware is released. You will find the latest firmware available for download from the ASUS support page at [https://www.asus.com/support/](https://www.asus.com/support/) or the appropriate product page at [https://www.asus.com/Networking/](https://www.asus.com/Networking/). ASUS has provided a link to new firmware for selected routers at the end of this notice.
2.  Set up separate passwords for your wireless network and router-administration page. Use passwords with a length of at least eight characters, including a mix of capital letters, numbers and symbols. Do not use the same password for multiple devices or services.
3.  Enable ASUS AiProtection, if your router supports this feature. Instructions on how to do this can be found in your router’s manual, or on the relevant ASUS support page, at [https://www.asus.com/Networking/](https://www.asus.com/Networking/).

  
  

Please note that if you choose not to install this new firmware version then, to avoid any potential unwanted intrusion, we strongly recommend that you disable remote access from WAN or AiCloud, and reset your router to its default settings.  
  
If you have already installed the latest firmware version, please disregard this notice.  
  
Should you have any question or concerns, please contact ASUS via our Security Advisory reporting system: [https://www.asus.com/securityadvisory/](https://www.asus.com/securityadvisory/)
