**STADIA TERMS OF SERVICE**

Last modified: 1 December 2020 ([view archived version](https://support.google.com/stadia/?p=archived_tos))

### Welcome to Stadia!

**Introduction**. Thanks for using Stadia. For users based in the European Economic Area ('EEA') and Switzerland, Stadia is provided by Google Ireland Ltd. and any purchases on Stadia are sold by Google Commerce Limited, both located at Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. For all other users, Stadia is provided by Google LLC, located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States. The entity providing Stadia to you is hereinafter referred to as 'Google'.

**Terms and Policies**. Stadia, including the Stadia mobile app and your use of the Stadia Controller, is a Google 'Service', as described in the [Google Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms). To use Stadia, you need to agree to the Google Terms of Service, as supplemented by these Stadia Terms of Service (which include the [Stadia Code of Conduct](http://g.co/stadia/conduct)) (collectively, the 'Terms'). Note: The [Stadia Privacy Notice](http://stadia.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB) and the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) explain how we treat your information and protect your privacy when you use Stadia. Although those policies are not part of these Terms, we encourage you to read them to better understand how you can update, manage, export and delete your information.

### 1\. Using Stadia

**Our Service**. Stadia is a cloud-based platform through which you can access and play interactive entertainment content, e.g. games ('Content'). The Service and Content is subject to the Terms and any additional limitations listed at the time of purchase or access. After signing up for Stadia using your Google Account and consenting to the Terms, you will be granted access to the Service. You may purchase or subscribe to Content and access that Content on Stadia in accordance with these Terms.

**Access to and use of Content**. Content may be purchased, provided for free (e.g. as part of a demo, free trial or promotion), or included as part of a paid subscription for your personal, non-commercial use. Content is tied to your Google Account and is non-transferable, which means that you may not transfer your Content to a different Google Account.

Stadia does not allow for concurrent access to Content through a single account, and you may not allow others to access Stadia through your account except where authorised by Google.

All Content is licensed to you by the publisher listed on the details page for the Content (or, in the case of add-on Content, such as in-game purchases and virtual currency, the details page for the associated base game) ('Publisher'). Where Google or an affiliate is the Publisher, your licence to the Content is supplied under these Terms. In the case of a third-party Publisher, if the Publisher does not supply a licence agreement for the Content, then the Publisher grants you a limited, non-exclusive licence to access and use the Content for which you have an entitlement for your personal, non-commercial use through Stadia. For users based in North America, the licence from the Publisher in the preceding sentence is provided under the terms of the standard [Stadia End User Licence Agreement for Content](https://stadia.google.com/g.co/stadia/contentEULA).

Some Content may rely on services provided by the Publisher to support certain features or functionality ('Publisher Services') and the Publisher may provide additional terms ('Publisher Services Terms') that you need to accept before you can use Publisher Services.

Some Publishers may allow you to create, upload or otherwise submit your own material in their Content. For the avoidance of doubt, any such material is subject to the Publisher Services Terms and any agreements that you enter into with the Publisher, and you retain any intellectual property rights that you hold in that material unless you enter into a separate agreement with the Publisher of the Content or another third party under which you assign or license those rights.

**Restrictions**. You may not:

*   use any Content, in whole or in part, as part of any public performance (except where permitted using features of the Service or where doing so would not constitute a copyright infringement);
*   use any stream ripping, stream capture or similar software to record or create a copy of any Content, even if no fee is charged (except where doing so would not constitute a copyright infringement);
*   sell, rent, lease or redistribute access to Stadia; or
*   use Stadia or Content, as part of any service for sharing, lending or multi-person use, except as specifically permitted by Google.

**Purchased Content**. When you purchase Content ('Purchased Content') you are granted the non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access the Purchased Content, subject to the Terms and any additional limitations listed at the time of purchase or access. The purchase of Content means that you are granted an access right to the Purchased Content through the Service and does not include a transfer of a property right in the Purchased Content.

**Supported Countries**. Access to Content is provided from supported countries. Content and features may vary between countries. If you access Stadia from outside of your home country, certain Content or features may not be available. [Learn more](https://stadia.google.com/g.co/stadia/countries) about accessing Stadia outside of your home country.

**Age Requirements and Parental Controls**. In order to use Stadia, you need a valid Google Account, subject to the applicable [age restrictions](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409?hl=en-gb). Users under the required age may only use Stadia if they have a Google Account managed with [Family Link](https://families.google.com/familylink/privacy/child-policy/) and with the approval of a family manager, who will receive information about such use of Stadia on a parent dashboard and have access to parental controls.

**Connectivity and Access**. The accessibility and performance of the Service and Content (including resolution, frame rate and latency) may vary based on the availability and quality of your network connection. Your ability to access and use Content may be blocked or interrupted if your connection does not meet minimum requirements or due to any temporary connection problems. To access the Service and Content on Stadia, you must use compatible [hardware](https://support.google.com/stadia/answer/9338852) and [software](https://support.google.com/stadia/answer/9338852) and pass Stadia’s applicable [playability tests](http://g.co/stadia/connection), which test your network connection to the Service and Content, on an ongoing basis.  Google will aim to keep any Content which you have purchased or claimed available for gameplay at any time. However, you may temporarily lose access to the Services or to such Content due to temporary Service interruption, scheduled maintenance or limited server capacity in your area. Such short interruptions of Service do not entitle you to any refunds. For more information on refunds, please see Stadia’s [Refund Policy](http://g.co/stadia/returns) and the further explanations below.

**Third-Party Fees**. You are responsible for any access or data fees incurred from third parties (such as your Internet provider or mobile operator) in connection with your use and viewing of Content.

### 2\. Purchases and Payments

The following section applies to all Stadia purchases except for purchases made through the Stadia app on Android. For Stadia purchases made through the Stadia app on Android, the purchase terms set forth in the [Google Play Terms of Service](http://g.co/stadia/docs#googleplayterms) apply.

**Contractual Partner**. When you make a purchase on Stadia, you enter into a separate sales contract. For residents of the European Economic Area ('EEA') and Switzerland, the seller and contractual partner is Google Commerce Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. For all other users, the seller and contractual partner for your home country is identified on the [Stadia Seller Table](https://stadia.google.com/g.co/stadia/seller).

**Pricing**. Pricing and availability of all Content and subscriptions are subject to change at any time prior to purchase.

**Completion of the Contract**. Any contract for the purchase and use of Content or subscriptions is completed and performance of this contract begins as soon as you complete your purchase.

**Pre-Orders**. When you place a pre-order for Content, you will receive an email confirming the pre-order only. Your contract for the purchase and use of that Content is completed when the Content becomes available to you, and you will be charged for the purchase at that time. You can cancel your pre-order at any time up to the point when the Content becomes available. Google will cancel your pre-order if the Content is previously withdrawn from sale through Stadia and we reserve the right to cancel your order in the event that the price changes before your order is fulfilled.

**Google Payments**. In order to purchase Content or subscriptions through Stadia, you must have a Google Payments account and agree to the [Google Payments Terms of Service](https://payments.google.com/payments/apis-secure/u/0/get_legal_document?ldo=0&ldt=buyertos&ldr=GB). Besides these terms, we also publish the [Google Payments Privacy Notice](https://payments.google.com/payments/apis-secure/u/0/get_legal_document?ldo=0&ldt=privacynotice&ldl=en_gb). You are responsible for all amounts payable associated with purchases made through Stadia on your account. Purchases are made via the payment method indicated prior to purchase. You must have a valid, accepted form of payment on file in order to make purchases or participate in free trial offers.

**Family Payment Method**. If you are the family manager of a family group on Google, you will be required to set up a valid family payment method for your family members to use to purchase Content on Stadia. You will be responsible for all of your family members’ purchases of Content using the family payment method. If a family group is deleted, or a family member leaves the family group, you may be charged for pending purchases made by family members using the family payment method.

**Subscriptions**. If you purchase a subscription, you receive any Content or services provided as part of that subscription on a continuing basis unless you cancel. Subscriptions are automatically charged at the start of each billing period (whether monthly, annually or another period as indicated during the subscription process) and you may be charged no more than 24 hours before the beginning of each billing period.

1.  **Trial Period**. When you subscribe to the Service or Content for a price, you may receive access to the subscription benefits at no charge for a specific trial period as indicated, after which you will be charged until you cancel the subscription, unless otherwise indicated. To avoid being charged, you must cancel before the end of the trial period. Once you cancel a trial, you will immediately lose access to the Service or Content unless otherwise specified. Access to such trial periods may be limited to a certain number of trials for each user during a given period, or other restrictions.
2.  **_Price Changes_**. When you purchase a subscription, you will be charged at the rate applicable at the time of your agreement to subscribe. If the price of the subscription increases later, Google will notify you. Before any increase of the rate of the Subscription, we will take into account and balance your legitimate interests. The increase will apply to the next payment due from you after the notice, provided that you have been given at least 30 days prior written notice before the change is made. If you are given less than 30 days prior notice, the price increase will not apply until the payment after the next payment due. If you do not wish to pay the increased price for a subscription, you may cancel the subscription and you will not be charged further amounts for the subscription, provided that you have notified us before the end of the current billing period.
3.  **Cancellations**. You may cancel a subscription at any time. Your cancellation will take effect at the conclusion of the current billing period. Subscriptions may include the right to access and play specified Content. Those rights will be revoked if your subscription is cancelled.

**Refunds**. On top of the withdrawal rights for consumers based in the EEA set forth in Section 3 of the Terms, Google offers additional rights of refund, which are set out in Stadia’s [Refund Policy](http://g.co/stadia/returns).

### 3\. Withdrawal Rights for Consumers Based in the EEA

The terms in this section apply only if you are a consumer based in the EEA.

**Withdrawal Rights for Digital Content**. Under the law you have an automatic statutory right of withdrawal from contracts for purchases of Content on Stadia. The same applies when you purchase a subscription for digital content. However, when you make a purchase of Content on Stadia you agree that the Content will be available to you immediately, and you acknowledge that as a result you waive your automatic statutory right of withdrawal.

**Withdrawal Rights for Services**. Under the law you have an automatic statutory right to withdraw from contracts for purchases of services within 14 days without giving any reason. The withdrawal period will expire 14 days after the conclusion of the contract. To exercise the right of withdrawal, you must inform Google Commerce Limited of your decision to withdraw from this contract by an unequivocal statement. You may use the model withdrawal form language below, but it is not obligatory. Alternatively, you may contact Google Commerce Limited, c/o Customer Support, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, or contact [Stadia Customer Support](http://g.co/stadia/contact).

You will receive an acknowledgement of receipt of such a withdrawal on a durable medium (e.g. by email) without undue delay. To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.  

If you withdraw from this contract, you will be reimbursed all payments that you made under the contract without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which your decision to withdraw from this contract is received by Google Commerce Limited. We will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.

If you requested to begin the performance of services during the withdrawal period, you may be required to pay an amount in proportion to the services provided until you have communicated to us your withdrawal from this contract, in comparison with the full coverage of the contract.

**Model withdrawal form**.

**Consumer Alternative Dispute Resolution**. Google Commerce Limited neither commits to nor is obliged to settle disputes before an Alternative Dispute Resolution entity.

### 4\. Family Sharing

Certain Content and subscriptions may be shared with family members in your household through your Stadia Family Library, subject to any age restrictions and other listed requirements. Limitations apply and not all Content or subscriptions are eligible for family sharing.

In order to serve as the family manager, you must be at least 18 years old. If you use Family Link, your family members may be able to see certain information about you, including your name, photo, email address, age and purchase history. If you are the family manager, you will be required to maintain a valid payment method for use by family members for Stadia-related purchases, and you are responsible for any purchases made using that payment method. If you’re the family manager and Google disables your account, your family members may lose access to shared Content or subscriptions.

The corresponding Content may only be accessed once at any given time. As such, family members will not be able to access the same Content simultaneously using a single licence.

### 5\. Code of Conduct/Consequences of Violations

While using Stadia and Content, you must follow the [Stadia Code of Conduct](http://g.co/stadia/conduct). If Google determines that you have materially or repeatedly violated any of the Terms, including those guidelines, then your access to Stadia or certain Content or Service functionality may be suspended, limited or revoked, depending on the severity and number of violations. You will not be entitled to any refunds for purchased Content or subscriptions, other than as provided for in the Stadia Refund Policy, if you temporarily or permanently lose access. We will notify you with the reason for our action unless there are objective and concrete reasons to believe that to do so would cause Google or another person legal liability, would compromise an investigation, would compromise the operation of any Google products, services, or systems, would cause harm to our users or would be in breach of the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority.

### 6\. Safety

Please carefully read the [health and safety information](http://support.google.com/stadia/?p=health_safety) in the Stadia Help Centre before using Stadia.

WARNING ABOUT THE RISK OF EPILEPSY AND PRECAUTIONS TO BE TAKEN WHEN PLAYING VIDEO GAMES. Some people may experience epileptic seizures or loss of consciousness when seeing certain types of flashing lights or other visual stimuli, and may experience seizures when they watch certain television images or play certain video games. This may occur even when there is no prior history of epileptic seizure. If you have ever had symptoms of epilepsy (seizures or loss of consciousness) in the presence of light stimuli, please consult your doctor before use. When using Stadia: avoid playing if you are tired or if you miss sleep; make sure that you play in a well-lit room; and take breaks of ten to fifteen minutes every hour.

### 7\. Changes to Terms

**Changes to the Terms**.  The Terms may be modified as provided for in the [Google Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms).  For users based in the European Economic Area, where you are presented with the opportunity to object or consent to the changed terms, if you object or do not consent, the changes will not apply in relation to you; however, we reserve the right to terminate the Service to you if all other requirements for a termination are met (according to the Terms or any service-specific terms). If we terminate, you will retain access to your Purchased Content through the Service in accordance with the last version of the Terms that you accepted, but you may be prohibited from purchasing additional content and using other Stadia functionality.
