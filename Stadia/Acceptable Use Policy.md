=============================================

Last modified: November 5, 2019

Introduction
------------

BY ACCESSING INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT CONTENT (“CONTENT”) ON STADIA, YOU AGREE TO  
THE TERMS OF THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR CONTENT (“EULA”). This EULA is an  
agreement between you and the Content publisher (“Publisher”), and governs your use of Content unless  
you have entered into a separate agreement with the Publisher governing your use of the Content. The  
identity of the Publisher of Content can be found on the applicable details page on Stadia. Where the  
Publisher is not Google LLC or its affiliates (“Google”): (A) Publisher (and not Google) is solely  
responsible for the Content; and (B) Google is a third-party beneficiary to this EULA and has the right to  
enforce its terms. Where Google is the Publisher of Content, this EULA does not apply and your use of  
such Content is governed by the Stadia Terms of Service.

License
-------

The Content is licensed to you, not sold. Publisher grants you a limited, non-exclusive license to access  
and use the Content for which you have an entitlement for your personal, non-commercial use through  
Stadia. The Publisher reserves all rights in and to the Content that are not expressly granted to you under  
this EULA.

Updates and Services
--------------------

Publisher may update the Content from time to time in its discretion, but is not obligated to provide you  
with any such updates. If Publisher provides any online services in connection with your use of the  
Content, such services may be modified or discontinued at any time.

Warranties and Disclaimers
--------------------------

OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS EULA, PUBLISHER AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, AND  
DISTRIBUTORS DO NOT MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE CONTENT OR RELATED SERVICES.  
FOR EXAMPLE, PUBLISHER MAKES NO COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE SUITABILITY OF GAME CONTENT,  
GAME FUNCTIONALITY, OR CONTENT RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS.  
PUBLISHER PROVIDES THE CONTENT AND ANY RELATED SERVICES “AS IS”. SOME JURISDICTIONS  
PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN WARRANTIES, LIKE THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS  
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW,  
PUBLISHER EXCLUDES ALL WARRANTIES.

Limitation of Liability
-----------------------

WHEN PERMITTED BY LAW, PUBLISHER AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, AND DISTRIBUTORS WILL  
NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, OR DATA, FINANCIAL LOSSES, OR INDIRECT,  
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL  
LIABILITY OF PUBLISHER AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, AND DISTRIBUTORS FOR ANY CLAIMS  
UNDER THIS EULA, INCLUDING FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID  
TO ACCESS THE CONTENT. IN ALL CASES, PUBLISHER AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, AND  
DISTRIBUTORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT REASONABLY  
FORESEEABLE.

General
-------

The terms of this EULA may be modified from time to time. You should look at the terms regularly. Notice  
of modifications to these terms will be posted on this page. Changes will not apply retroactively and will  
become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new  
functions or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If there is a conflict between  
these terms and the Stadia TOS, the Stadia TOS will control for that conflict.  
If you do not comply with these terms, and Publisher does not take action right away, this doesn’t mean  
Publisher is giving up any rights that Publisher may have (such as taking action in the future).  
The laws of California, U.S.A., excluding California’s conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes  
arising out of or relating to this EULA or the Content. All claims arising out of or relating to this EULA or  
the Content will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California,  
USA, and you and Publisher consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.  
If it turns out that a particular term in this EULA is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.
