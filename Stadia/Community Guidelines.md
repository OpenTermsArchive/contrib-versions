Code of Conduct
---------------

Our policies play an important role in maintaining a safe and positive experience for gamers online. Stadia is made up of a community of players from all around the world. It’s up to each player on Stadia to follow our policies, community guidelines and values and to help make Stadia an enjoyable place to play for everyone.

These policies cover both conduct and content on the Stadia platform. This includes anything that you create, share, use or promote on Stadia, like links or images. It also includes your Stadia Name, your profile information and your in-game behaviour. When we identify a potential policy violation, we may review and take action ranging from limiting features to temporarily or permanently banning a player from Stadia.

Stadia’s values
===============

Stadia was created to bring gaming to everyone, everywhere. Stadia is a place for all players to be themselves with confidence, free from bullying, hatred and harassment.

It’s important that you treat other players the way that you’d like to be treated. If you're unsure if your actions might violate our community guidelines, ask yourself if you would act in the same way when interacting with someone standing next to you.

Here are a few things to remember:
----------------------------------

*   Gaming is for everyone.  
    Stadia is your community.
    
*   Hate, harassment and bullying  
    have no place on Stadia.
    
*   When playing with others, show good sportspersonship, whether you win or lose.
    
*   Some competitive banter or rubbish talk is OK as long as everyone’s onboard with it, but don’t be abusive or malicious.
    
*   Don’t be a troll.  
    No one likes a troll.
    
*   Above all,  
    be excellent to one another.
    

If you see something that you suspect is inappropriate or wrong, be it in-game content or a player’s behaviour, use the report feature to submit it for review by the Stadia team. If you just want to stop playing with or hearing from someone, you can also block and mute them. Both reporting and blocking options can be found on a player's profile.

Guidelines
==========

Games are fun when we're all playing by the same rules, and it's up to each player to use these guidelines to help keep Stadia fun and enjoyable for everyone.

Stadia is a place for everyone

Stadia is a platform for everyone, which means that we bring people together with diverse and differing opinions. While we support free expression, we don't tolerate content that promotes or condones violence, or incites hatred against an individual or group on the basis of their race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, age, nationality, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or any other characteristic. This can be a delicate balancing act, but if the primary emphasis of something that you say promotes hatred or violence against others, you’ve crossed the line.

Be nice to others

It’s never OK to harass, troll, bully or threaten someone, or to encourage others to do any of these things on Stadia. Don’t tell others to hurt or kill themselves, and do not create accounts dedicated to harassment or spreading hate. Sharing content, including doctored or out-of-context content, with the intent to degrade, bully or harm someone is also a violation of our policies.

Anyone using our platform to single someone out for malicious abuse, to threaten someone with serious harm, to sexualise a person in an unwanted way or to harass in other ways may have the offending content removed or be permanently banned from using the platform.

In emergency situations, we may escalate imminent threats of serious harm to the police authorities. Keep in mind that online harassment is also illegal in many places and can have serious offline consequences for both the harasser and the victim.

If you think bullying or harassment has crossed the line into a malicious attack, you can report it for review by the Stadia team. You can also block and mute players from their player profile.

Protect and respect the privacy of others

We want you to feel safe when you're playing games on Stadia, so we don’t allow players to share or distribute personal or confidential information without permission. This includes credit card numbers, confidential national ID numbers, account passwords or anything that can put someone’s privacy or security at risk.

Keep children safe

We take child safety very seriously. Don't use Stadia to do anything that endangers children – on or off the platform. This includes predatory behaviour towards children, such as:

*   'Child grooming' (for example, befriending a child online to facilitate, either online or offline, sexual contact and/or exchanging sexual imagery with that child);
*   'Sextortion' (for example, threatening or blackmailing a child by using real or alleged access to a child’s intimate images);
*   Sexualisation of a minor (for example, imagery that depicts, encourages or promotes the sexual abuse of children or the portrayal of children in a manner that could result in the sexual exploitation of children); and
*   Trafficking of a child (for example, advertising or solicitation of a child for commercial sexual exploitation).

Do not create, upload or distribute content that exploits or abuses children. This includes all child sexual abuse materials. We will remove such content and take appropriate action, which may include disabling accounts, limiting access to product features and reporting it to the [National Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC)](http://www.missingkids.com/home) and other authorities. Note that this policy applies to everything that you share through Stadia, even if you didn't originally create the content.

If you find any content on Stadia that you think exploits children, [send us a report](https://support.google.com/stadia/answer/9617409?hl=en-gb). If you find content elsewhere on the Internet, please contact [the appropriate agency in your country](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/148666) directly. If you believe that a child is in danger of or has been subject to abuse, exploitation or trafficking, contact the police immediately.

And remember, you can always block anybody on Stadia that you don’t want to be contacted by.

Choose your Stadia Name with care and wear it like a badge

Some language is not appropriate for all audiences. Don’t use obscene, profane or sexually explicit language or symbols in your Stadia Name. If you wouldn't say it to someone in public, don't put it in your name.

Share stuff that’s tasteful, relevant and not spam

It’s pretty simple. Don’t send unwanted, vulgar or crude messages to other players on Stadia. Don’t share links or content that includes sexually explicit or pornographic material.

Don’t use Stadia to spam users, like sending unwanted promotional or commercial content or unwanted or mass solicitation.

Don’t send viruses, malware or any other content that harms or interferes with anyone. Finally, don't use Stadia for phishing scams in any way.

Also, it's not OK to send someone non game-related content or links that are meant to shock or disgust, which includes violent or gory content that's primarily intended to be sensational or gratuitous. If the content is posted in a news, documentary, scientific or artistic context, make sure that you give everyone enough information to help them understand why you’re sharing it. In some cases, content may be so violent or shocking that no amount of context will allow that content to remain on our platforms. Lastly, don't encourage others to commit specific acts of violence.

Keep it legal

Stadia is a global platform and we don’t condone illegal activities. This means that you can’t use our platform to engage in or promote dangerous and illegal acts, such as illegal drug sales, fraud or human trafficking. Don’t engage in unauthorised transactions like accessing or trying to access another gamer’s account without their permission. Don’t transfer, sell or otherwise provide third parties access to your accounts or Stadia Name. Don’t attempt to use or share fraudulent methods of getting subscriptions, games, gift cards, account credit, content or hardware.

Don't use Stadia to sell anything. This includes sharing content that sells or promotes commercial content, products and services, including things like alcohol, gambling, pharmaceuticals and unapproved supplements, tobacco, fireworks, weapons or health/medical devices. If we get a complaint that content is targeting Stadia users and breaking laws and regulations, we may remove or restrict the offending content or account.

Additionally, we don’t allow terrorist organisations to use Stadia for any purpose, including recruitment. We also prohibit content that relates to terrorism, promotes terrorist acts, incites violence or celebrates terrorist attacks.

Games are best on a level playing field

When players cheat, use exploits or otherwise tamper with software to gain a competitive advantage in games, it ruins the experience for everyone. No one likes playing a one-sided game, so don’t cheat by exploiting a game’s vulnerabilities or glitches. Those caught cheating will face consequences ranging from temporary to permanent bans.

Be yourself

Impersonation includes any attempt to deceive, mislead or confuse others on Stadia into thinking that you are a different person or organisation that you don’t represent, which can include copying usernames, avatars and profile information. Accounts that impersonate another person or organisation may be removed under our impersonation policy.

Respect the content and the rights of other people and companies

Don’t use things that aren’t yours without permission. When you’re using Stadia, don’t use things that aren’t yours. Never use someone’s intellectual property in an unauthorised way.

We do not allow copyright infringement. We also don’t allow content that encourages or induces infringement of intellectual property rights. We will respond to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement. Google may suspend or terminate Stadia access for the accounts of repeat infringers. For more information or to notify us of an alleged infringement, please visit our copyright procedures page.

Using multiple accounts to troll, abuse or get around restrictions

Sometimes players want to access Stadia using multiple Google Accounts and in most cases that’s cool. But don’t create or use multiple Google Accounts in order to troll, evade our policies, bypass blocks or otherwise subvert restrictions placed on your use of or access to Stadia.

Consequences
============

Your safety on Stadia is a top priority for us. Our response to violations of our policies varies and may include:

*   Assignment of a new Stadia Name, if you create an inappropriate Stadia Name.
*   Temporary bans: If you violate our policies, we may send you a warning. Repeated violations of our policies, including across platforms like YouTube, may result in temporary restrictions of social features on Stadia, including but not limited to chat, live streaming on YouTube, Crowd Play and access to online multiplayer functionality for varying amounts of time.
*   Permanent ban: Access to the platform may be suspended if you commit egregious or repeated violations or try to circumvent suspensions through the use of multiple accounts.

We don’t take these actions lightly. While we understand that people make mistakes, we believe that learning from mistakes is an opportunity to become better players and people.

We hope that all of your experiences on Stadia are positive. Thank you for being a vital part of building and supporting this community with us.
