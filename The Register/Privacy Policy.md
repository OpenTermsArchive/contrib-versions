You have the right to human review of any significant decisions made using automated processing. Please contact us if you wish to exercise this right.

We may use your personal data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. You will only receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information or purchased products/services from us and have not opted out of receiving marketing.

All users will see advertisements on the Website, but the content of these adverts will differ depending on user behavior. These adverts are delivered based on analysis of your behavior on the Website. Advertising servers may set cookies on your device solely for advert delivery, recording, and segmentation purposes.

#### Opting Out of Marketing

To unsubscribe from marketing messages, click the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any marketing message or contact us directly. We will retain your contact details on an opt-out list to ensure we respect your preferences.

### Sharing Your Personal Data

Depending on how and why you provide us with your personal data, we may share it in the following ways:

* With our company group members (subsidiaries and holding companies)
* With official bodies to prevent fraud or comply with legal requirements (government bodies, tax authorities, law enforcement)
* With service providers who help us operate the Website and provide services
* With analytics and search engine providers
* With third parties whose content you have viewed or engaged with
* With professional service providers (insurers, accountants, auditors, lawyers)

We will not share your personal data with third parties for their direct marketing unless it relates to a specific activity you've consented to (e.g., sponsored webinars or whitepapers).

We reserve the right to publish correspondence sent to us unless you specifically ask us not to reveal your identity. We will never knowingly publish a private email address unless you ask us to.

We may also disclose your personal data:

* To comply with legal obligations
* To enforce our terms and conditions
* To protect rights, property, or safety

### Service Providers

Our service providers provide administrative, statistical, and technical services. We provide only the minimum data necessary and require them to protect this data and not use it for other purposes. All data processors sign contracts committing to respect individual rights and assist us in helping you exercise your rights.

### International Data Transfers

We may transfer your data to service providers based outside the UK or European Economic Area (EEA). Where we do this, we ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your data:

* Transfers to countries recognized by the European Commission as providing adequate protection
* Transfers governed by Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission
* Other appropriate cross-border transfer solutions that provide adequate protection

By using our Website, you consent to these transfers. If you would like more information about our transfer mechanisms, please contact us.

### Data Retention

We hold your personal data only as long as required to provide services and satisfy legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine appropriate retention periods, we consider:

* The amount, nature, and sensitivity of the data
* Potential risk of harm from unauthorized use
* Processing purposes and alternative means to achieve those purposes
* Legal and regulatory requirements

You should expect us to keep your data for as long as you have a registered account. If you delete your account, we may need to keep some data for up to six years for compliance purposes.

By law, we must keep basic customer information (contact, identity, financial, transaction data) for six years after they cease being customers. You can ask us to delete your data earlier in some circumstances (see 'Your Rights').

We may anonymize your data for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely.

### Security

We implement appropriate security measures to protect your data, including:

* Secure servers (on our premises or in secure third-party data centers)
* Encryption (SSL)
* Password protection
* Access limitations to employees, agents, and contractors on a need-to-know basis
* Confidentiality obligations for those who access your data
* Data breach procedures

If you have a password to access parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping it confidential.

### Your Rights

If you are based in the UK or European Economic Area (EEA), you have the following rights:

#### Right of Access

You can request access to your personal data that we hold (sometimes called a "subject access request").

#### Right to Rectification and Erasure

You can request that we correct inaccurate data or erase data that is no longer necessary to retain.

#### Right to Restrict Processing

You can ask us to stop processing your data in certain circumstances, such as:

* If you contest the accuracy of the data
* If our processing is unlawful but you don't want us to erase the data
* If you need us to hold the data for legal claims even though we no longer need it

#### Right to Data Portability

You can request that we provide your data in a machine-readable format to transfer to another service provider.

#### Right to Stop Receiving Communications

You can opt out of marketing communications at any time using the 'unsubscribe' link or by contacting us directly.

#### Right to Object to Automated Decision Making and Profiling

You can request information about and object to automated decision making that significantly affects you.

#### Exercising Your Rights

To exercise any of these rights, please write to us with clear details of your request. We may ask for ID verification. We normally respond to legitimate requests within one month, though complex requests may take longer.

There is no fee for these requests unless they are clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive.

If you are unhappy with how we've handled your data, you can complain to your local data protection authority, though we would appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns first.
