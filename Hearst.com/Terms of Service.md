You may not use any such information to transmit or facilitate transmission of unauthorized or unsolicited advertising, junk or bulk email, chain letters, or any other form of unauthorized solicitation. You agree not to send, create, or reply to so called mailbombs (i.e., emailing copies of a single message to many users, or sending large or multiple files or messages to a single user with malicious intent) or engage in spamming (i.e., unsolicited emailing for business or other purposes) or undertake any other activity which may adversely affect the operation or enjoyment of the Site by any other user or third party, including placing malware on the Site.

   11. Third Party Services

The Site might contain links to third party websites, apps or other services (e.g., social media platforms) (collectively, “Third Party Services”). Such Third Party Services are not under the control of Hearst and Hearst is not responsible for any Third Party Services. Hearst provides these Third Party Services only as a convenience and does not review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any representations with respect to Third Party Services. When you use Third Party Services, you do so at your own risk. When you link to a Third Party Service, the applicable third party's terms and policies apply, including the third party's privacy policies.

   12. Local Regulations

   13. Termination

Hearst may, in its sole discretion, terminate your use of the Site, or remove and discard any content or information stored, sent, or received via the Site without prior notice and for any reason or no reason, including, but not limited to: (i) any unauthorized access or use of the Site, (ii) any violation under these Terms of Use, or (iii) tampering with or alteration of any of the software, data files, and/or content contained in or accessed through, the Site. You may terminate your account for any reason or no reason. Termination, suspension, or cancellation under these Terms of Use or your access rights to the Site shall not affect any right or relief to which Hearst may be entitled, at law or in equity. Upon such termination, suspension, or cancellation, all rights granted to you will automatically terminate and immediately revert to Hearst and its licensors and all rights granted by you to Hearst shall survive in perpetuity.

Notwithstanding any termination, suspension, or cancellation under these Terms of Use or your access rights to the Site, the following provisions under these Terms of Use will survive: Sections 2 – 18.

   14. Entire Agreement

These Terms of Use (including the Privacy Notice) constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Site. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word including means including without limitation. If any provision of these Terms of Use is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms of Use will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.

   15. Changes to these Terms of Use

We may revise, prospectively, these Terms of Use by posting an updated version on the Site. You consent and agree to receive notices of updates to these Terms of Use through our posting of an updated Terms of Use on the Site.

16\. Dispute Resolution (Arbitration Clause and Class Action Waiver)

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.**

*   **1.1 Except for either party's claims of infringement or misappropriation of the other party's patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret, any and all disputes between you and Hearst arising under or related in any way to this Agreement, must be resolved through binding arbitration as described in this section. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be interpreted broadly. It includes, but is not limited to, all claims and disputes relating to your use of any of the Site.**
*   **1.2 YOU AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND HEARST ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. YOU AND HEARST AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. ANY ARBITRATION WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.**
*   **1.3 The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA“), as modified by this section. For any claim where the total amount of the award sought is $10,000 or less, the AAA, you and Hearst must abide by the following rules: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted solely based on written submissions; and (b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties. If the claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA rules, and the hearing (if any) must take place in your choice of the following locations: San Francisco, CA, Denver, CO, or New York, NY. The arbitrator's ruling is binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event this agreement to arbitrate is held unenforceable by a court, then the disputes that would otherwise have been arbitrated shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts located in New York City, New York. Claims of infringement or misappropriation of the other party's patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall be exclusively brought in the state and federal courts located in New York City, New York.**

   17. No Waiver

No failure or delay by Hearst in exercising any right, power or privilege under these Terms of Use will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege under these Terms of Use.

   18. Governing Law

These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed solely and exclusively in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, USA without giving effect to any law that would result in the application of the law of another jurisdiction.

   19. Copyright/Trademark Information

Copyright © 2019, Hearst Communications, Inc. All rights reserved. All trademarks, logos and service marks (“Marks”) displayed on the Site are our property or the property of other third parties. You are not permitted to use these Marks without our prior written consent or the consent of such third party which may own the Marks.
