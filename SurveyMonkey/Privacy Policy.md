Specifically, we use machine learning on survey data to help Creators by:
        * identifying trends in their responses; 
        * ongoing training of models to optimize responses; 
        * making product recommendations and providing guidance on which products and services work best in different scenarios (For an example of this check out how SurveyMonkey Genius works here);

        * undertaking personalization for survey Creators; 
        * improving user experience (for example, by collecting and using device and browser information from Respondents to improve how our survey service operates on those devices and in those browsers or by altering questions to match the responses being provided by a Respondent); and
        * identify insightful data trends (which do not disclose Personal Data) and make recommendations to Creators based on those trends.

For example, if you clicked on an advertisement for one of our brands, presented by one of our partners on the web, which brought you to one of our websites, we will record this information to help us track the success of advertising campaigns.
    
    3.3.4 **Legal obligation.**
    
    **(a)** To respond to legal requests, we may need to disclose information we hold about you. If we receive a subpoena or other legal request, we may need to inspect the data we hold to determine how to respond.
    
    **(b)** We may also use event data:
    
    * To enforce our agreements where applicable;
    * To prevent potentially illegal activities; and
    * To screen for and prevent undesirable or abusive activity. For example, we have automated systems that screen content for phishing activities, spam, and fraud under our [Acceptable Uses Policy](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/acceptable-uses-policy/).
    

4\. How we share or disclose Personal Data
------------------------------------------

**4.1 Information you share**

Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember that when you share information publicly, it can be indexable by search engines. Our services provide you with different options on sharing and deleting your content but we cannot delete content from search engines so you need to be careful about information you make public.

**4.2 Information we share**

We do not share your information or data with third parties outside SurveyMonkey except in the following limited circumstances:

**(a)** If you are a Creator that is part of a SurveyMonkey team plan or SurveyMonkey Enterprise plan, your account information and data will be shared with the primary administrator(s) and your survey data may also be visible to other members in your team with whom you share your surveys or with whom you collaborate. Your administrator(s) will be able to view your account data, change your passwords, suspend, transfer or terminate your account or restrict your settings. Please refer to your organization’s internal policies if you have questions about this.

**(b)** If you are part of a SurveyMonkey Enterprise plan, your plan’s administrator(s) can transfer your survey questions and responses to, or share them with, other members in your team, including your plan’s administrator(s) themselves.  Your plan’s administrator(s) can also delete your survey questions and responses.  Your plan’s administrator(s) may also have the ability to make changes to any aspects of your survey questions and analysis.  Please refer to your organization’s internal policies if you have questions about this.

**(c)** If your organization has purchased a SurveyMonkey Enterprise account and you are using an email address on a domain owned by your employer or organization linked to your individual account, you may be asked to migrate to the SurveyMonkey Enterprise Account and your email address, name and account data will subsequently be visible to the primary administrator(s) for that account once you have been migrated. You may be notified in advance of this migration and given an opportunity to change the email address linked to your account if you are not using your account for business purposes.

**(d)** To help us provide certain aspects of our services we use our affiliates and trusted key partners – in particular, we engage third parties to:

* facilitate our collectors for sending surveys by email or text to Respondents. For email delivery, we use [SparkPost](https://www.sparkpost.com/policies/privacy/) and for text/SMS services we use [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/legal/privacy). We share the relevant contact information for respondents (email address or phone number as applicable) with these third parties.
* facilitate Creators in making [payments](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/list-of-payment-processors/).
* to facilitate the delivery of certain features, for example if you use the “Create a survey using AI” we will send your survey prompts to our AI vendor. We recommend that you do not include Personal Data in these prompts but if you do they will be shared with the AI vendor. 
* to detect fraud (to include, for example, performing identify checks or verify malicious IPs).
* deliver and help us track our marketing and advertising content.
* help us track website conversion success metrics.
* manage our sales and customer support services to you, including for resolving any disputes.

**(e)** We enter into confidentiality and data processing terms with partners to ensure they comply with high levels of confidentiality and best practices in privacy and security standards and we regularly review these standards and practices. You can find more information in our [Subprocessor Statement](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/subprocessor-list/?ut_source=legal&ut_source2=privacy&ut_source3=inline).

**(f)** On your instructions, we share your information or data if you choose to use an integration in conjunction with SurveyMonkey services, to the extent necessary to facilitate that use. See further information [here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/apps/?ut_source=legal&ut_source2=privacy&ut_source3=inline) on our API partners.

**(g)** We also may have to share information or data for the following purposes:

* To meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request;
* To enforce applicable policies, including investigation of potential violations;
* To detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues;
* To protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of our users, the public or to SurveyMonkey and/or as required or permitted by law; and
* To facilitate a sale, merger or change in control of all or any part of our company or business or in preparation for any of these events.

5\. Data Retention
------------------

If you are a Creator, we generally do not delete the data in your account as long as your account is active – you are responsible for and control the time periods for which you retain this data. You can read about this [here](https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/policy/surveymonkey-data/) for account use. Here are some exceptions: 

* If you are a SurveyMonkey Basic (free) user on our platforms and you have not engaged with the service actively for some time, we reserve the right to delete your account and data in accordance with our data retention policy. 

* If you have exceeded your response limit as a SurveyMonkey Basic (free) account holder, we will delete the overages if you do not upgrade within a fixed timeframe. 

We also encourage Creators to actively review their data retention practices in their account and take care to retain data only as long as is strictly necessary. 

We also describe the expiry periods for cookies on our websites in our [Cookies Notice](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/cookies/?ut_source=legal&ut_source2=privacy&ut_source3=inline). 

6\. Personalized marketing and cookies
--------------------------------------

We and our partners use cookies and similar technologies on our websites. For more information see our [Cookies Notice](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/cookies/?ut_source=legal&ut_source2=privacy&ut_source3=inline). For information about cookies used in our surveys please see [Cookies used on Survey Pages](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/survey-page-cookies/). If you are a customer of SurveyMonkey and separately use cookies or similar technologies in conjunction with any of our products and services, then you yourself will be responsible for complying with any laws related to the use of those technologies and this Privacy Notice is not applicable to that use by you.

You can also choose to remove or disable cookies via your [browser settings](https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/account/opt-out/) and, depending on your geographic location you can withdraw consent to non-essential cookies using the in-product cookie preferences tool.

You can opt-out from direct marketing in your account and we provide opt-out options in all direct marketing emails. Finally, if you do not wish to see personalized marketing content on the web related to our service you can clear the cookies in your browser settings. See our Help Center article on how to do this [here](https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/account/opt-out/). 

7\. Security
------------

We have a security statement related to our self-serve businesses (SurveyMonkey and Wufoo) available to view [here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/security/). For information about security related to our other business lines you can speak to a sales representative by completing the form [here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/enterprise/?form_autoload=).

8\. Safety of Minors
--------------------

Our services (including creating and responding to surveys) are not intended for and may not be used by minors. “**Minors**” are individuals under the age of 16 (or under a higher age as provided in certain countries or territories). SurveyMonkey does not knowingly collect Personal Data from Minors or allow them to register. If it comes to our attention that we have collected Personal Data from a Minor, we may delete this information without notice. If you have reason to believe that this has occurred, please contact customer support.

9\. Data Transfers
------------------

Your information and data may be processed in and transferred or disclosed in the United States and countries in which our affiliates are located and in which our service providers are located or have servers. You can view a list of these locations in our [EU Data Transfer Statement](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/subprocessor-list/). You can also read about data that is stored in our other data centers here in our [International Data Center Overview](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/international-data-center-overview/). We ensure that the recipient of your Personal Data offers an adequate level of protection, for instance by entering into the appropriate back-to-back agreements with standard contractual clauses or other transfer mechanisms as approved by the European Commission or relevant data protection authority.

We have also provided a [help article](https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/policy/data-processing-agreements-eu/) which answers some additional questions about data transfers to the US.

**9.1** **EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles.**

SurveyMonkey Inc. has self-certified its compliance under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension and the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles. SurveyMonkey is committed to subjecting all personal information received from the European Union (EU) member countries, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the Framework’s applicable Principles. To learn more about the DPF, see [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s](https://www.privacyshield.gov/).

SurveyMonkey also complies with the onward transfer liability provisions of the DPF.

When SurveyMonkey receives personal information under the DPF and then transfers it to a third-party service provider acting as agent on SurveyMonkey's behalf, SurveyMonkey has certain liability under the DPF if both (i) the agent processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the DPF and (ii) SurveyMonkey is responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. In certain situations, SurveyMonkey may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

With respect to Personal Data received or transferred pursuant to the DPF, SurveyMonkey is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Please contact SurveyMonkey as described in Section 11 below if you have any concerns or complaints of any nature. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider, (free of charge) at [https://www.jamsadr.com/dpf-dispute-resolution](https://www.jamsadr.com/dpf-dispute-resolution).

Under certain conditions, more fully described on the DPF website [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/How-to-Submit-a-Complaint-Relating-to-a-Participating-Organization-s-Compliance-with-the-DPF-Principles-dpf](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/How-to-Submit-a-Complaint-Relating-to-a-Participating-Organization-s-Compliance-with-the-DPF-Principles-dpf), you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.

10\. Who is my data controller?
-------------------------------

If you have provided survey responses, filled out a form, submitted an application, or provided website feedback to a Creator using SurveyMonkey services, that Creator is the controller of your data, and SurveyMonkey is the processor of that data. 

For SurveyMonkey Enterprise account holders, your organization’s primary administrator controls some basic account level information which you input when setting up your account like name, email address and profile photo.  

If you have provided survey responses, filled out a form, submitted an application, or provided website feedback directly to SurveyMonkey, then SurveyMonkey is the controller and our use of that data is described in our [SurveyMonkey Research Privacy Notice](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/survey-research-privacy-notice/?ut_source=legal&ut_source2=privacy&ut_source3=inline). 

If you are a Creator and have received more responses than your plan allows (“overage data”), SurveyMonkey is the controller over the overage data until you change your plan type, or the overage data is deleted in accordance with section 12.4 of our [Terms of Use](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/terms-of-use/#12.4%20SurveyMonkey%20Basic%20(Free)%20Plan%20Response%20Limits.) or per the terms of your negotiated contract.

SurveyMonkey is a controller for the account-level data provided by its Creators and panelists from Contribute and Rewards.  

11\. Your rights
----------------

You may wish to exercise a right to obtain information about yourself or to correct, update or delete that information. For more information about these rights you can read about it [here](https://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_US/kb/surveymonkey-gdpr). Some of these rights may be subject to some exceptions or limitations in local law. Please note your rights and choices vary depending upon your location. We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity and we will respond to your request to exercise these rights within a reasonable time (and in all cases within 30 days of receiving a request) subject to the below for specific categories of person.

**11.1** **Apply Applicants**

For SurveyMonkey Apply users please see [information on how to exercise your rights here](https://help.smapply.io/hc/en-us/articles/360003749013-SurveyMonkey-Apply-Data-Privacy).

* **11\. 2 Creator**
    
    Where you hold an account with any SurveyMonkey service, you are entitled to a copy of all Personal Data which we hold in relation to you. You also may be entitled to request that we restrict how we use your data or object to some aspect of our treatment of your data. You can access a lot of your data in your own account when you log in. If you want to exercise your rights, please contact us [here](https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/contact/?l=en&form=datarequest).
    
    Depending on your plan type, SurveyMonkey also enables you to export your own response data from our system in a variety of formats so that you can back it up or use it with other applications. Alternatively, for assistance in exporting you can contact us.
    
* **11.3 Respondent**
    
    Where you have responded to a survey, form, questionnaire or application sent to you by a Creator using a SurveyMonkey service, you will need to reach out directly to that individual or organization to discuss managing, deleting, accessing, restricting access to or otherwise withdrawing consent for use of the information which you provided to them in your responses. SurveyMonkey does not control your response data and, accordingly, is not in a position to directly handle these requests in relation to that data. If you are having difficulties finding this Creator or if you have any other questions after reading this Privacy Notice, you can [contact us](https://help.surveymonkey.com/contact?l=en&form=datarequest) [through](https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/contact/?l=en&form=datarequest) [our support team](https://help.surveymonkey.com/contact?l=en&form=datarequest) and we will try our best to help you.
    
* **11.4 Panelist**
    
    If you have created a Rewards or Contribute account with us, you can request a copy of your Personal Data, delete your Personal Data, or correct it. 
    
* **11.5 Visitor**
    
    Where you have visited our website and you want to exercise any of the above rights please contact our support team [here](https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/contact/?l=en&form=datarequest). Alternatively, if your request is for the right to be forgotten as it relates only to our use of cookies you can achieve this by clearing the cookies in your browser settings. See our Help Center article describing how to do this [here](https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/account/opt-out/).
    
* **11.6 Authorized Agent**
    
    If you are a third party organization acting on behalf of a data subject (or class of data subjects) to exercise data subject rights, we do work with you. In this case:
    
    * We ask you to follow our process outlined in this Privacy Notice for security reasons so that we can independently verify the Creator (if it is a Creator) making any requests to exercise their rights.
    * Where applicable, we directly interact with a Creator’s registered email address, because we authenticate users with username and unique password and not with other identifying information (e.g., photo ID or similar).
    
    **Please do not share other forms of personal identification for data subjects with us when submitting requests.**
    

**11.7 **Other rights and choices****

* For rights and choices specific to US consumers, please refer to our [Region Specific Privacy Notice](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/region-specific-privacy-statement/).

TechFacts are published on an anonymous basis – that is, no Respondent Personal Information displayed in a TechFact unless your Respondents authorize the use of their name and company affiliation. You are able to see the individual respondent’s identity in your account and, if you give a SurveyMonkey employee permission to view that response, then SurveyMonkey will also see this. However, we never publish or disseminate this information (unless you explicitly ask us to do so).

We assign a unique identification number to each TechFact. The ID will appear on each copy of the TechFact. Our site is designed so that visitors may look up and view TechFacts without the collection of any personal information (except for such visitor's internet protocol (IP) address).
