The end page is part of the SurveyMonkey website. We may include our own [research surveys](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/survey-research-privacy-notice/?usecase=ggooppvv-usecasequery%2525253Ctestexample.com%2525252F%2525253E%2525253Cdiv%2525252Fid%2525253Dsavik%2525253E%2525253C%2525252Fdiv%2525253E) and polling on this end page.

    * To enforce our agreements where applicable;
    * To investigate security issues;
    * To prevent or address potentially unlawful activities; and

    **(a) Contact information.**
    
    * We only use contact information to respond to an inquiry on behalf of a Customer if you, as a Respondent, contact us.
    
    **(b) Cookies.**
    
    * We use required cookies to ensure the operation of a Creator’s survey, form, application, or other SurveyMonkey product. These cookies are used to ensure that all aspects of the survey operate appropriately and optimally. For more information please read our [Cookies section below](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/privacy/?usecase=ggooppvv-usecasequery%2525253Ctestexample.com%2525252F%2525253E%2525253Cdiv%2525252Fid%2525253Dsavik%2525253E%2525253C%2525252Fdiv%2525253E#cookies) and our [Respondent Cookies Notice](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/survey-page-cookies/?usecase=ggooppvv-usecasequery%2525253Ctestexample.com%2525252F%2525253E%2525253Cdiv%2525252Fid%2525253Dsavik%2525253E%2525253C%2525252Fdiv%2525253E).
    * Examples: We use page tags to allow the email sender (for a survey or form for example) to measure the performance of email messaging and to learn how to improve email deliverability and open rates. We also use cookies to ensure a respondent can only take a survey once (where the Creator has set this function) and to track completion rates of surveys.
    * After completion of a survey, in most cases, you will be redirected to our website and treated as a website visitor where other cookies may be used so you should read our Website Visitor section if this is of interest to you.
    
    **(c) Device and browser data.**
    
    * We use device data both to troubleshoot problems with our service and to make improvements to it. 
    * We use your device and browser data to provide our services to the Creator. For example: your IP address is used to ensure that you do not complete the same survey, form, application or questionnaire twice if the creator has included settings to avoid this (ballot stuffing).
    
    **(d) Inferred geographic location.**
    
    * We also may infer your geographic location based on your IP address. This allows Creators to filter responses by inferred geographic location. Note: we do not collect precise (GPS) location. 
    
    **(e) Event data.**
    
    * We use event data for many different business purposes including the following:
        * To create and improve services, features, content or make recommendations;
        * To track behavior at the aggregate/de-identified level to identify and understand trends in the various interactions with our services; and
        * To fix bugs and troubleshoot product functionality.
    
    **(f) Third parties and integration data.**
    
    * We will collect and use information from third parties and integration partners to facilitate Creators in sending surveys/forms/applications/questionnaires to you.
    
    **(g) Survey response data.**
    
    * SurveyMonkey may use first party machine learning or third party artificial intelligence tools on data around the type of survey the Creator has sent you, the question type, survey responses (at an aggregated and de-identified/pseudonymized level only where possible), and device and event data associated with responses to  fulfill our contract with Creators and provide Creators with useful and relevant insights from the data they have collected using our services. Specifically, we use machine learning on survey data to help Creators by:
        * identifying trends in their responses; 
        * ongoing training of models to optimize responses; 
        * making product recommendations and providing guidance on which products and services work best in different scenarios
        * Extracting and analyzing usage patterns, for example, we might identify when respondents prefer multiple choice versus open text questions and make predictive response suggestions when certain question types are selected. We might also use this data to help improve analysis of responses;
        * undertaking personalization for survey Creators; 
        * improving user experience (for example, by collecting and using device and browser information from Respondents to improve how our survey service operates on those devices and in those browsers or by altering questions to match the responses being provided by a Respondent); and
        * identify insightful data trends (which do not disclose Personal Data) and make recommendations to Creators based on those trends.
    * A Creator has some controls over how we use responses and may have opted-out of applying machine learning to responses where it is [linked to a specific product feature](https://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_US/kb/Automatic-Insights) in some cases. 
    
    3.2.2 **Legitimate Interest**s
    
    We process your personal information in the following categories of data for legitimate interests pursued by us. We have undertaken to ensure that we place clear limitations on each of these uses so that your privacy is respected and only the information necessary to achieve these legitimate aims is used.
    
    **(a) Usage information.**
    
    * We use information about how you use our services to improve our services for you and all users and to make recommendations to our customers about usage of our services.

4\. How we share or disclose Personal Data
------------------------------------------

**4.1 Information you share**

Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember that when you share information publicly, it can be indexable by search engines. Our services provide you with different options on sharing and deleting your content but we cannot delete content from search engines so you need to be careful about information you make public.

**4.2 Information we share**

We do not share your information or data with third parties outside SurveyMonkey except in the following limited circumstances:

**(a)** If you are a Creator that is part of a SurveyMonkey Enterprise or team plan, your account information and data will be shared with the primary administrator(s) and your survey data may also be visible to other members in your team with whom you share your surveys or with whom you collaborate. Your administrator(s) will be able to view your account data, change your passwords, suspend, transfer or terminate your account or restrict your settings. Please refer to your organization’s internal policies if you have questions about this.

**(b)** If you are the primary administrator of a SurveyMonkey team plan, the team name and the domain of the email address on your account may be shared with an individual who has been invited to preview a survey created by one of the members of your team in order to facilitate their request to join the team. You can learn more about how to adjust Team Discovery settings [here.](https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/teams/team-discovery/)

**(c)** If you are part of a SurveyMonkey Enterprise or team plan, your plan’s administrator(s) can transfer your survey questions and responses to, or share them with, other members in your team, including your plan’s administrator(s) themselves.  Your plan’s administrator(s) can also delete your survey questions and responses.  Your plan’s administrator(s) may also have the ability to make changes to any aspects of your survey questions and analysis.  Please refer to your organization’s internal policies if you have questions about this.

**(d)** If your organization has purchased a SurveyMonkey Enterprise plan and you are using an email address on a domain owned by your employer or organization linked to your individual account, you may be asked to migrate to the SurveyMonkey Enterprise Account and your email address, name and account data will subsequently be visible to the primary administrator(s) for that account once you have been migrated. You may be notified in advance of this migration and given an opportunity to change the email address linked to your account if you are not using your account for business purposes.

**(e)** To help us provide certain aspects of our services we use our affiliates and trusted key partners – in particular, we engage third parties to:

* facilitate our collectors for sending surveys by email or text to Respondents. For email delivery, we use [SparkPost](https://www.sparkpost.com/policies/privacy/) and for text/SMS services we use [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/legal/privacy). We share the relevant contact information for respondents (email address or phone number as applicable) with these third parties.
* facilitate Creators in making [payments](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/list-of-payment-processors/?usecase=ggooppvv-usecasequery%2525253Ctestexample.com%2525252F%2525253E%2525253Cdiv%2525252Fid%2525253Dsavik%2525253E%2525253C%2525252Fdiv%2525253E).
* to facilitate the delivery of certain features, for example if you use the “Create a survey using AI” we will send your survey prompts to our AI vendor. We recommend that you do not include Personal Data in these prompts but if you do they will be shared with the AI vendor. 
* to detect fraud (to include, for example, performing identify checks or verify malicious IPs).
* deliver and help us track our marketing and advertising content.
* help us track website conversion success metrics.
* manage our sales and customer support services to you, including for resolving any disputes.
* We enter into confidentiality and data processing terms with partners to ensure they comply with high levels of confidentiality and best practices in privacy and security standards and we regularly review these standards and practices. You can find more information in our [Subprocessor Statement](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/subprocessor-list/?usecase=ggooppvv-usecasequery%2525253Ctestexample.com%2525252F%2525253E%2525253Cdiv%2525252Fid%2525253Dsavik%2525253E%2525253C%2525252Fdiv%2525253E&ut_source=legal&ut_source2=privacy&ut_source3=inline).

**(f)** On your instructions, we share your information or data if you choose to use an integration in conjunction with SurveyMonkey services, to the extent necessary to facilitate that use. See further information [here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/apps/?usecase=ggooppvv-usecasequery%2525253Ctestexample.com%2525252F%2525253E%2525253Cdiv%2525252Fid%2525253Dsavik%2525253E%2525253C%2525252Fdiv%2525253E&ut_source=legal&ut_source2=privacy&ut_source3=inline) on our API partners.

* To enforce applicable policies, including investigation of potential violations;
* To detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues;

* To facilitate a sale, merger or change in control of all or any part of our company or business or in preparation for any of these events.

5\. Data retention

If you are a Creator, we generally do not delete the data in your account as long as your account is active – you are responsible for and control the time periods for which you retain this data. You can read about this [here](https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/policy/surveymonkey-data/) for account use. Here are some exceptions:

10\. Who is my data controller?
-------------------------------

If you have provided survey responses, filled out a form, submitted an application, or provided website feedback to a Creator using SurveyMonkey services, that Creator is the controller of your data, and SurveyMonkey is the processor of that data. 

For SurveyMonkey Enterprise account holders, your organization’s primary administrator controls some basic account level information which you input when setting up your account like name, email address, and profile photo.  

If you have provided survey responses, filled out a form, submitted an application, or provided website feedback directly to SurveyMonkey or at SurveyMonkey's request through a third party, then SurveyMonkey is the controller and our use of that data is described by this Notice and in our [SurveyMonkey Research Privacy Notice](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/survey-research-privacy-notice/?usecase=ggooppvv-usecasequery%2525253Ctestexample.com%2525252F%2525253E%2525253Cdiv%2525252Fid%2525253Dsavik%2525253E%2525253C%2525252Fdiv%2525253E&ut_source=legal&ut_source2=privacy&ut_source3=inline). 

If you are a Creator and have received more responses than your plan allows (“overage data”), SurveyMonkey is the controller over the overage data until you change your plan type, or the overage data is deleted in accordance with section 12.4 of our [Terms of Use](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/terms-of-use/?usecase=ggooppvv-usecasequery%2525253Ctestexample.com%2525252F%2525253E%2525253Cdiv%2525252Fid%2525253Dsavik%2525253E%2525253C%2525252Fdiv%2525253E#12.4%20SurveyMonkey%20Basic%20(Free)%20Plan%20Response%20Limits.) or per the terms of your negotiated contract.

SurveyMonkey is a controller for the account-level data provided by its Creators and panelists from Contribute and Rewards. More information can be found in section 13.5 of this Privacy Notice.

* **11.6 Authorized Agent**
    
    If you are a third party organization acting on behalf of a data subject (or class of data subjects) to exercise data subject rights, we do work with you. In this case:
    
    * We ask you to follow our process outlined in this Privacy Notice for security reasons so that we can independently verify the Creator (if it is a Creator) making any requests to exercise their rights.
    * Where applicable, we directly interact with a Creator’s registered email address, because we authenticate users with username and unique password and not with other identifying information (e.g., photo ID or similar).
    
    **Please do not share other forms of personal identification for data subjects with us when submitting requests.**
