This Privacy Notice applies to all the products, services, websites and apps offered by Momentive Inc., Momentive Europe UC, Momentive Brasil Internet Eireli, Momentive Netherlands B.V., and other Momentive affiliates (collectively “Momentive”), except where otherwise noted. We refer to those products, services, websites, and apps collectively as the “services” in this notice. Unless otherwise noted in your contract, our services are provided by Momentive Inc. inside of the United States, by Momentive Brasil Internet Eireli inside of Brazil, and by Momentive Europe UC everywhere else.

Personal Data means information relating to a living individual who is, or can be, reasonably identified from information, either alone or in conjunction with other information (a "**Data Subject**").

If you want to identify your data controller please see the “[Who is my data controller?](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/privacy/?ut_source=legal&ut_source2=privacy&ut_source3=inline#who-is-my-data-controller)” section below.

2\. Information we collect
--------------------------

### 2.1 Who are “you”?

**We refer to “you” a lot in this Privacy Notice. To better understand what information is most relevant to you, see the following useful definitions.**

**Creators:** You hold an account within a Momentive service and you either directly create surveys, forms, applications, or questionnaires or you are collaborating on, commenting on, or reviewing surveys, forms, applications, or questionnaires within an account.

**Respondents:** You have received a survey, form, application, or questionnaire powered by a Momentive service.

**Panelists:** You have signed up and agreed to take surveys sent to you by Momentive on behalf of creators. We deal with panelists in an entirely separate section of our Privacy Notice, [which you can read here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/privacy-information-specific-to-other-services?ut_source=legal&ut_source2=privacy&ut_source3=inline).

**Visitors:** You are just visiting one of our websites because you are curious, or you have heard about us from our marketing and sales channels!

### 2.2 Information we collect about you.

* Contact Information (for example name or email address).  
    You might provide us with your contact information, whether through use of our services, a form on our website, an interaction with our sales or customer support team, or a response to one of Momentive’s own surveys or forms.
* Usage information.  
    We collect usage information about you whenever you interact with our websites and services. This includes which webpages you visit, what you click on, when you perform those actions, what language preference you have, what you buy and so on.
* Device and browser data.  
    We collect information from the device and application you use to access our services. Device data mainly means your IP address, operating system version, device type, device ID/MAC address, system and performance information, and browser type. If you are on a mobile device we also collect the UUID for that device.
* Information from page tags.  
    We use first party and third party cookies and tracking services that employ cookies and page tags (also known as [web beacons](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/cookies/)) to collect data about visitors to our websites. This data includes usage and user statistics. Emails sent by Momentive or by users through our services also include page tags that allow the sender to collect information about who opened those emails and clicked on links in them. We provide more information on cookies [below](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/privacy/#cookies) and in our [Cookies Notice.](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/cookies/?ut_source=legal&ut_source2=privacy&ut_source3=inline)
* Log Data.  
    Like most websites today, our web servers keep log files that record data each time a device accesses those servers. The log files contain data about the nature of each access, including originating IP addresses, internet service providers, the files viewed on our site (e.g. HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system versions, device type and timestamps.
* Referral information.  
    If you arrive at a Momentive website from an external source (such as a link on another website or in an email), we record information about the source that referred you to us.
* Information from third parties and integration partners.  
    We collect your personal information from third parties where, for example, you give permission to those third parties to share your information with us, where such information is publicly available online or through your device/browser data.

If you are a Creator, we may also collect:

Account Information

* Registration information.  
    You need a Momentive account before you can use Momentive services. When you register for an account, we collect your first and last name, username, password and email address. If you choose to register by using a third party account (such as your Google or Facebook account), please see “Information from third parties” below.
* Billing information.  
    If you make a payment to Momentive, we require you to provide your billing details, a name, address, email address and financial information corresponding to your selected method of payment (e.g. a credit card number and expiration date or a bank account number). If you provide a billing address, we will regard that as the location of the account holder to determine the Momentive entity with whom you contract and the sales tax, if applicable, to be applied to your purchase.
* Account settings.  
    You can set various preferences and personal details on pages like your [account settings page](https://www.surveymonkey.com/user/account/?ut_source=legal&ut_source2=privacy&ut_source3=inline) (or on your account settings page for our other products as applicable). These may include, for example, your default language, time zone and communication preferences (e.g. opting in or out of receiving marketing communications from Momentive).

When you use our services, we may also collect the following data on your behalf for certain services:

* Address book information.  
    We may allow you to import email addresses and other contact information into an [Address](https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/send/importing-email-lists/) [Book](https://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_US/kb/What-is-the-address-book) so you can easily invite people to take your surveys or fill in your form via our collectors. We do not use this data for our own purposes or to contact anyone, except at your direction.
* Survey/form/application data.  
    We store your survey/form/application data (questions and responses) for you and provide analysis tools for you to use with respect to this data.
* Profile information.  
    When you sign up for our services you are asked to provide us with information about yourself and to give us more detailed insights into who you are. If you are in a SurveyMonkey Enterprise account this may include providing your photo so your administrator(s) and colleagues can identify you.

3\. How we use the information we collect
-----------------------------------------

* **3.1 Creator**
    
    We process personal data about you where:
    
    * **You have consented;**
    * **We need to** **f**ulfill our contractual responsibility to deliver the services to you; **or**
    * We have a legitimate interest to:
        * improve the service experience; and
        * develop new products and service features.
    
    In each of the instances where we describe how we use your data in this Privacy Notice, we have identified which of these grounds for processing we are relying upon.
    
    You have consented to us using certain types of tracking and third party cookies on our websites. In particular:
    
    * Cookies and Similar technology.
    
    We or third party data and advertising platforms that we work with may use or combine multiple technologies, such as cookies, page tags, mobile identifiers and IP addresses to infer users’ common identities across different services and multiple devices such as tablets, browsers, and mobile phones. We may do so, for instance, to tailor ads to users, to enable us to determine the success of our advertising campaigns and to improve upon them. These third party data and advertising platforms may sometimes use data that we provide to them in order to improve their technologies and their ability to match common devices to users. We also may use this technology to allow a Creator to measure the performance of their email messaging and to learn how to improve email deliverability and open rates. You can withdraw your consent at any time.
    
    More details: The above data and techniques are used for personalized marketing, analytics, and related purposes. To learn more about interest-based advertising and how to opt-out of it, please see our [Cookies Notice](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/cookies/?ut_source=legal&ut_source2=privacy&ut_source3=inline) in Section 6. We use this data to personalize online marketing campaigns to be relevant to you and your interests in our services. By clearing your cookies in your browser settings, you will no longer see personalized messages in this way but you continue to see ads over the internet that are not based on the information you provided to Momentive. Depending on your geographic location you can also withdraw your consent using our in-product cookie management tools.
    
    We process your personal information in the following categories of data for legitimate interests pursued by us, which are described in detail in this Privacy Notice. We have undertaken to ensure that we place clear limitations on each of these uses so that your privacy is respected and only the information necessary to achieve these legitimate aims is used. Our primary goal is to improve upon and make sure our services and messaging are relevant for all our users, while also ensuring that personal information of all users is respected and protected.
    
    * Contact Information.
    
    We use contact information to respond to your inquiries, send you information as part of the services, and send you marketing information (for as long as you do not opt-out).
    
    More details: We use your email address to send you marketing (newsletters), unless you indicate a preference to opt-out and for general updates on your account. You can opt out of marketing communications at any time by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link in them and changing the relevant setting on your [My Account](https://www.surveymonkey.com/user/account/?ut_source=legal&ut_source2=privacy&ut_source3=inline) page.
    
    * How you use our services.
    
    We use information about how you use our services to improve our services for you and all users and to make recommendations to you and your organization about our other services.
    
    More details: We collect information about the types of surveys/forms/applications you create (e.g. HR surveys), the types of plans you purchase and your account transactional behavior to build a profile about you so as to help direct you and your organization to other relevant features and services we offer and to optimize user experience, for example by making recommendations to you or your organization.
    
    We may also use usage information such as levels and nature of activity in your account and number of responses you are receiving to personalize the features and services we highlight for you and your organization in our Sites, improve user experience and to make recommendations to you and your organization about our services through our sales and marketing efforts. 
    
    * Device and browser data.
    
    We use device data both to troubleshoot problems with our service and to make improvements to it. We also infer your geographic location based on your IP address.
    
    More details: We collect this to help us improve your service experience through a specific device/browser by optimizing how the website looks in a particular browser, how your screen brightness affects your experience and to ensure the service operates optimally and as it should on different devices and browsers.
    
    * Log data.
    
    We use log data for many different business purposes to include:
    
    * To monitor abuse and troubleshoot.
    * To create new services, features, content or make recommendations.
    * To track behavior at the aggregate/anonymous level to identify and understand trends in the various interactions with our services.
    * To fix bugs and troubleshoot product functionality.
    * To investigate security issues.
    
    More details: Your IP address is used to determine where an unknown/unauthorized access may have occurred in your account (abuse monitoring).
    
    * Referral information.
    
    We use referral information to track the success of our integrations and referral processes.
    
    * Third parties and integrations.
    
    We collect and use information from third parties and integration partners, where applicable to one of our services, to:
    
    * Ensure you can sign-up to our service from a third party integration like Facebook/LinkedIn/Microsoft/Google/SSO;
    * To personalize our services for you; and
    * Ensure you can use our service in conjunction with other services.
    
    See further information [here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/apps/?ut_source=legal&ut_source2=privacy&ut_source3=inline) on our API partners – for other Momentive services see below or on the website for that service.
    
    * Service and Marketing uses.
    
    * **Profiling.** We combine information about you from third party sources with information we hold about you to create a user profile, which will help us to make our sales and marketing efforts more relevant to you and to personalize and improve your service experience.
    * **Machine learning.** We use machine learning techniques on certain data in order to provide users with useful statistics and more relevant insights from the data they have collected using our services and to optimize our marketing campaigns and for fraud detection. For example, if you have used open text questions in a survey, our machine learning may provide you with useful insights into the trends in responses to that question in our Analyze survey tool.
    * To manage our services we will also internally use your information and data, for the following limited purposes:
    
    * To enforce our agreements where applicable;
    * To prevent or address potentially unlawful activities; and
    * To screen for and prevent undesirable or abusive activity. For example, we have automated systems that screen content for phishing activities, spam, and fraud.
    
    * Legal uses.
    
    To respond to legal requests or prevent fraud, we may need to use and disclose information or data we hold about you. If we receive a subpoena or other legal request, we may need to inspect the data we hold to determine how to respond.
    
    We collect and use the following on the basis that we have to use this information in order to fulfill our contract with you:
    
    * Your Account Information.
    
    We need to use your account information to run your account, provide you with services, bill you for our services, provide you with customer support, and contact you or your organization about your service or account. We may also use billing information in aggregate to determine billing and payment trends and, as needed, to adjust or manage pricing at the individual level or across all service users. We occasionally send you communications of a transactional nature (e.g. service-related announcements, billing-related matters, changes to our services or policies, a welcome email when you first register). You cannot opt out of these communications since they are required to provide our services to you.
    
    * Your Profile.
    
    We process other aspects of your account information (like the personal information you provide about your job, your job title, and your marketing preferences) as well as information obtained from public sources, for legitimate interests like providing you with a personalized experience and relevant and useful marketing information as well as to make other product, feature and service recommendations to you and your organization to optimize the use of the services we offer. If you are part of a SurveyMonkey Enterprise account, we also provide an opportunity for you to upload a photo so that your administrator(s) and colleagues can identify you.
    
    You can object to us using your information as described above but in some cases, our ability to fully and properly provide our services to you may be impacted if you do not want us to collect or use the above data. **Furthermore, if you are a SurveyMonkey Enterprise account holder, your organization controls some of the data which you include in your profile and they can also edit or remove that information through the primary administrator(s) of that account.**
    
    In relation to Survey Data
    
    * Your Content.
    
    We also use survey questions and responses on an aggregated or deidentified basis as described in this Privacy Notice. We will never sell individual response data or identify/contact individual respondents except on your request or where required by law. Feature descriptions will identify where this is feature linked. See our “[Respondent](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/privacy/#three-two-respondent)” section.
    
    If you are part of a SurveyMonkey Enterprise plan, your plan’s administrator(s) can transfer your survey questions and responses to, or share them with, other members in your team, including your plan’s administrator(s) themselves.  Your plan’s administrator(s) can also delete your survey questions and responses.  Your plan’s administrator(s) may also have the ability to make changes to any aspects of your survey questions and analysis.  Please refer to your organization’s internal policies if you have questions about this. 
    
    Finally, if you use our survey tool, depending on the package you are on and the settings you have selected, your Respondents may reach the standard [survey end page](https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/create/survey-end-page/) on completion of a survey. The end page is part of the Momentive website. We may include our own [research surveys](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/survey-research-privacy-notice/) and polling on this end page. These surveys are optional for any Respondent to take or skip.
    
* **3.2 Respondent**
    
    We process your personal information in the following categories of data for legitimate interests pursued by us, which are described in detail in this Privacy Notice. We have undertaken to ensure that we place clear limitations on each of these uses so that your privacy is respected and only the information necessary to achieve these legitimate aims is used. Our primary goal is to improve upon and make sure our services and messaging are relevant for all our users, while also ensuring that personal information of all users is respected and protected.
    
    * Cookies (to include page tags).
    
    We collect information using cookies when you take a survey. These cookies are used to ensure that the full functionality of our survey service is operational, to ensure the survey operates appropriately and optimally. For more information please read our [Cookies section below](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/privacy/#cookies) and our [Respondent Cookies Notice](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/survey-page-cookies/?ut_source=legal&ut_source2=privacy&ut_source3=inline).
