--------------------------------------------

### What do we mean by 'Personal Data'?

References in this Privacy Notice to data, personal information, or information, are all references to Personal Data. Personal Data means information relating to a living individual (a "Data Subject") who is, or can be, reasonably identified from the information, either alone or in conjunction with other information.

### What do we collect data about?

We group consumers or businesses into the following categories:

* **Creator**: the business or consumer that holds an account within a SurveyMonkey service that either directly creates surveys, forms, applications, or questionnaires or that can collaborate, commenting, or review surveys, forms, applications, or questionnaires within an account.
* **Respondent**: the individual that receives a survey, form, application, or questionnaire powered by a SurveyMonkey service.
* **Panelist**: the individual that uses Contribute or Rewards to take surveys sent by SurveyMonkey on behalf of Creators, or an individual that receives surveys through a third party panel provider. Privacy information specific to panelists can be found in our [Contribute Privacy Notice](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/surveymonkey-contribute-privacy-notice/), [Rewards Privacy Notice](https://www.surveymonkey.com/rewards/privacy_statement/?ut_source=legal&ut_source2=privacy-information-specific-to-other-services&ut_source3=inline), and [Third Party Panel Privacy Notice](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/third-party-panelist-privacy-notice/).
* **Visitor**: you are just visiting one of our websites because you are curious,  have been invited to review a survey as a guest, or you have heard about us from our marketing and sales channels!

### Types of Personal Data We Collect

* Contact information.

* Cookie information.
    * We use first party and third party cookies and tracking services that employ cookies and page tags (also known as [web beacons](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/cookies/)) to collect data about visitors to our websites. This data includes usage and user statistics. Emails sent by SurveyMonkey or by users through our services also include page tags that allow the sender to collect information about who opened those emails and clicked on links in them. We provide more information on cookies in our [Cookies Notice.](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/cookies/)

* Device and browser data.
    * We collect information from the device and application you use to access our services. Device data mainly means your IP address, operating system version, device type, device ID/MAC address, system and performance information, and browser type. If you are on a mobile device we also collect the UUID for that device. We also infer your geographic location based on your IP address.

The log files contain data about the nature of each access, including originating IP addresses, internet service providers, the files viewed on our site (e.g. HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system versions, device type and timestamps.
* Referral information.
    * If you arrive at a SurveyMonkey website from an external source (such as a link on another website or in an email) or have been invited to review a survey as a guest, we record information about the source that referred you to us.
* Integration data.
    * We collect information from third parties with whom SurveyMonkey enables integrations in order to allow you to use both services.

    * You can set various preferences and personal details on pages like your [account settings page](https://www.surveymonkey.com/user/account/?ut_source=legal&ut_source2=privacy&ut_source3=inline) (or on your account settings page for our other products as applicable). These may include, for example, your default language, time zone and communication preferences (e.g. opting in or out of receiving marketing communications from SurveyMonkey).

    * We may allow you to import email addresses and other contact information into an [Address](https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/send/importing-email-lists/) [Book](https://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_US/kb/What-is-the-address-book) so you can easily invite people to take your surveys or fill in your form via our collectors. We do not use this data for our own purposes or to contact anyone, except at your direction.
* Survey/form/application data.
    * We store your survey/form/application data (questions and responses) for you and provide analysis tools for you to use with respect to this data.
* First party profile information.
    * When you sign up for our services you are asked to provide us with information about yourself and to give us more detailed insights into who you are. If you are in a SurveyMonkey Enterprise account this may include providing your photo so your administrator(s) and colleagues can identify you.

You have a choice as regards whether or not to use some of these features. For further information see our Respondent Section.
    * **Aggregated or de-identified survey questions and responses.**
        * We use aggregated or de-identified information to provide users with useful benchmarking statistics and more relevant insights from the data they have collected using our services.
        * We also use this data to enforce our agreements, where applicable.
    
    **Legitimate interests**
    
    We process your personal information in the following categories of data for legitimate interests pursued by us. We have undertaken to ensure that we place clear limitations on each of these uses so that your privacy is respected and only the information necessary to achieve these legitimate aims is used.

    * **Usage information.**
        * We use information about how you use our services to improve our services for you and all users and to make recommendations to you and your organization about our other services.
        * For example: We collect information about the types of surveys/forms/applications you create (e.g., HR surveys), the types of plans you purchase and your account transactional behavior to build a profile about you so as to help direct you and your organization to other relevant features and services we offer and to optimize user experience, for example by making recommendations to you or your organization.
        * We may also use usage information such as levels and nature of activity in your account and number of responses you are receiving to personalize the features and services we highlight for you and your organization in our Sites, improve user experience and to make recommendations to you and your organization about our services through our sales and marketing efforts.
    * **Event data.**
        * We use events contained in log data for many different business purposes to include:

        * We collect and use information from third parties and integration partners, where applicable to one of our services, to personalize our services for you.
    * **First party information.**
        * We process other aspects of your account information (like the personal information you provide about your job, your job title, and your marketing preferences) as well as information obtained from public sources, to provide you with a personalized experience and relevant and useful marketing information as well as to make other product, feature and service recommendations to you and your organization to optimize the use of the services we offer (where permitted by law).
        * You can object to us using your information as described above but in some cases, our ability to fully and properly provide our services to you may be impacted if you do not want us to collect or use the above data. Furthermore, if you are a SurveyMonkey Enterprise account holder, your organization controls some of the data which you include in your profile and they can also edit or remove that information through the primary administrator(s) of that account.
    * **Third party information.**
        * We combine information about you from third party sources (such as LinkedIn and ZoomInfo) with information we hold about you to create a user profile, which will help us to make our sales and marketing efforts more relevant to you and to personalize and improve your service experience.

        * We use referral information to track the success of our integrations and referral processes.
    * **End page data.**
        * If you use our survey tool, depending on the package you are on and the settings you have selected, your Respondents may reach the standard [survey end page](https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/create/survey-end-page/) on completion of a survey. The end page is part of the SurveyMonkey website. We may include our own [research surveys](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/survey-research-privacy-notice/?ut_source=legal&ut_source2=privacy&ut_source3=inline) and polling on this end page. These surveys are optional for any Respondent to take or skip. 
    * **De-identified Survey Data.**
        * We use machine learning techniques on aggregated or de-identified survey questions and responses to understand usage and improve our services.
    
    **Legal Obligation.**
    
    To respond to legal requests, we may need to use and disclose information we hold about you. If we receive a subpoena or other legal request, we may need to inspect the data we hold to determine how to respond.  
      
    We may also use usage data, event data, and aggregated or (where possible) de-identified survey questions and responses:
    
    * To enforce our agreements where applicable;
    * To investigate security issues;
    * To prevent or address potentially unlawful activities; and
    * To screen for and prevent undesirable or abusive activity. For example, we have automated systems that screen content for phishing activities, spam, and fraud under our [Acceptable Uses Policy](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/acceptable-uses-policy/).
    
* **3.2 Respondent**
    
    We process Personal Data about you as a Respondent where:
    
    * We need to fulfill our contractual responsibility to deliver the services to the Creator of the survey;
    * We have a legitimate interest; and
    * We have a legal obligation.
    
    **Contract**
    
    * **Contact Information**
        * We only use contact information to respond to an inquiry on behalf of a Customer if you, as a Respondent, contact us. 
    * **Cookies.**
        * We use essential cookies to ensure the functionality of a Creator’s survey, form, application, or other SurveyMonkey product. These cookies are used to ensure that the full functionality of our survey service is operational, to ensure the survey operates appropriately and optimally. For more information please read our [Cookies section below](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/privacy/#cookies) and our [Respondent Cookies Notice](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/survey-page-cookies/).
        * Examples: We use page tags to allow the email sender (for a survey or form for example) to measure the performance of email messaging and to learn how to improve email deliverability and open rates. We also use cookies to ensure a respondent can only take a survey once (where the Creator has set this function) and to track completion rates of surveys.
        * After completion of a survey, in most cases, you will be redirected to our website and treated as a website visitor where other cookies may be used so you should read our Website Visitor section if this is of interest to you.
    * **Device and browser data.**
        * We use device data both to troubleshoot problems with our service and to make improvements to it.
        * We use your device and browser data to provide our services to the Creator. For example: your IP address is used to ensure that you do not complete the same survey, form, application or questionnaire twice if the creator has included settings to avoid this (ballot stuffing).
    * **Inferred geographic location.**
        * We also may infer your geographic location based on your IP address. This allows Creators to filter responses by inferred geographic location. Note: we do not collect precise (GPS) location.
    * **Event data.**
        * We use event data for many different business purposes including the following:
            * To create and improve services, features, content or make recommendations;
            * To track behavior at the aggregate/de-identified level to identify and understand trends in the various interactions with our services; and
            * To fix bugs and troubleshoot product functionality.
    * **Third parties and integration data.**
        * We will collect and use information from third parties and integration partners to facilitate Creators in sending surveys/forms/applications/questionnaires to you.
    * **Survey response data.**
        * SurveyMonkey may use first party machine learning or third party artificial intelligence tools on data around the type of survey the Creator has sent you, the question type, survey responses (at an aggregated and de-identified/pseudonymized level only), and device and event data associated with responses to  fulfill our contract with Creators and provide Creators with useful and relevant insights from the data they have collected using our services. Specifically, we use machine learning on survey data to help Creators by:
            * identifying trends in their responses;
            * ongoing training of models to optimize responses;
            * making product recommendations and providing guidance on which products and services work best in different scenarios (For an example of this check out how [SurveyMonkey Genius works here](https://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_US/kb/SurveyMonkey-Genius));
            * Extracting and analyzing usage patterns, for example, we might identify when respondents prefer multiple choice versus open text questions and make predictive response suggestions when certain question types are selected. We might also use this data to help improve analysis of responses;
            * undertaking personalization for survey Creators;
            * improving user experience (for example, by collecting and using device and browser information from Respondents to improve how our survey service operates on those devices and in those browsers or by altering questions to match the responses being provided by a Respondent); and
            * identify insightful data trends (which do not disclose Personal Data) and make recommendations to Creators based on those trends.
        * A Creator has some controls over how we use responses and may have opted-out of applying machine learning to responses where it is [linked to a specific product feature in some cases](https://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_US/kb/Automatic-Insights).
    
    **Legitimate Interest**
    
    We process your personal information in the following categories of data for legitimate interests pursued by us. We have undertaken to ensure that we place clear limitations on each of these uses so that your privacy is respected and only the information necessary to achieve these legitimate aims is used.
    
    * **Usage information.**
        * We use information about how you use our services to improve our services for you and all users and to make recommendations to our customers about usage of our services.
        * For example: We collect information about the types of questions you answer. This data will be aggregated and/or de-identified where possible, so we can examine patterns in terms of respondent preferences when submitting responses. We collect and use all this data to help us improve our product so that questions are easier to answer and to help improve the completion rates on surveys/forms.
        * We will also use information such as the type of survey, form, questionnaire or application that you answered to personalize products we show you on completion of a survey and to understand trends in our service adoption. See more about [Customizing Survey End Page here](https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/create/survey-end-page/)).
    * **Responses (in aggregated and/or de-identified form).**
        * To build new product features.
    * **Inferred geographic location.**
        * We may infer your geographic location based on your IP address to produce aggregated data around Respondent location trends.

        * To enforce our agreements where applicable;
        * To investigate security issues;
        * To prevent or address potentially unlawful activities; and
        * To screen for and prevent undesirable or abusive activity. For example, we have automated systems that screen content for phishing activities, spam, and fraud under our [Acceptable Uses Policy](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/acceptable-uses-policy/).

        * Where permitted by law, we combine information about you from third party sources with information we hold about you to create a user profile, which will help us to make our sales and marketing efforts more relevant to you and to personalize and improve our marketing/sales campaigns and website experience.
    * **Usage information.**
        * We use information about how you have interacted with our websites to improve our website services for you and all users. Some examples relevant to you:
            * Examples: We collect information about the webpages you have visited and your activity on our sites at an aggregate level. We collect this information so that we can track the most visited and most useful parts of our website to identify what are our most popular services.
    * **Event data.**
        * We use event data for many different business purposes including the following:
            * To monitor abuse and troubleshoot;
            * To track your preferences and create new services, features, content or make recommendations personalized for you;
            * To track behavior at the aggregate/de-identified level to identify and understand trends in the various interactions with our services; and
            * To fix bugs and troubleshoot product functionality.
    * **Customer Support information.**
        * We may use information submitted through our Customer Support portal, such as name, email, and message text to train machine learning models to better predict and answer Customer Support question types.
    * Referral information.
        * We use referral information to track the success of our integrations and referral processes. For example: If you clicked on an advertisement for one of our brands, presented by one of our partners on the web, which brought you to one of our websites, we will record this information to help us track the success of advertising campaigns.
    
    Legal obligation.
    
    * To respond to legal requests, we may need to disclose information we hold about you. If we receive a subpoena or other legal request, we may need to inspect the data we hold to determine how to respond.
    * We may also use event data:
        * To enforce our agreements where applicable;
        * To prevent potentially illegal activities; and
        * To screen for and prevent undesirable or abusive activity. For example, we have automated systems that screen content for phishing activities, spam, and fraud under our [Acceptable Uses Policy](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/acceptable-uses-policy/).
    

4\. How we share or disclose Personal Data
------------------------------------------

**Information you share**

Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember that when you share information publicly, it can be indexable by search engines. Our services provide you with different options on sharing and deleting your content but we cannot delete content from search engines so you need to be careful about information you make public.

**Information we share**

We do not share your information or data with third parties outside SurveyMonkey except in the following limited circumstances:

* If you are a Creator that is part of a SurveyMonkey team plan or SurveyMonkey Enterprise plan, your account information and data will be shared with the primary administrator(s) and your survey data may also be visible to other members in your team with whom you share your surveys or with whom you collaborate. Your administrator(s) will be able to view your account data, change your passwords, suspend, transfer or terminate your account or restrict your settings. Please refer to your organization’s internal policies if you have questions about this.
* If you are part of a SurveyMonkey Enterprise plan, your plan’s administrator(s) can transfer your survey questions and responses to, or share them with, other members in your team, including your plan’s administrator(s) themselves.  Your plan’s administrator(s) can also delete your survey questions and responses.  Your plan’s administrator(s) may also have the ability to make changes to any aspects of your survey questions and analysis.  Please refer to your organization’s internal policies if you have questions about this.
* If your organization has purchased a SurveyMonkey Enterprise account and you are using an email address on a domain owned by your employer or organization linked to your individual account, you may be asked to migrate to the SurveyMonkey Enterprise Account and your email address, name and account data will subsequently be visible to the primary administrator(s) for that account once you have been migrated. You may be notified in advance of this migration and given an opportunity to change the email address linked to your account if you are not using your account for business purposes.
* To help us provide certain aspects of our services we use our affiliates and trusted key partners – in particular, we engage third parties to:
    * facilitate our collectors for sending surveys by email or text to Respondents. For email delivery, we use [SparkPost](https://www.sparkpost.com/policies/privacy/) and for text/SMS services we use [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/legal/privacy). We share the relevant contact information for respondents (email address or phone number as applicable) with these third parties.
    * facilitate Creators in making [payments](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/list-of-payment-processors/).
    * to facilitate the delivery of certain features, for example if you use the “Create a survey using AI” we will send your survey prompts to our AI vendor. We recommend that you do not include Personal Data in these prompts but if you do they will be shared with the AI vendor.
    * to detect fraud (to include, for example, performing identify checks or verify malicious IPs).
    * deliver and help us track our marketing and advertising content.
    * help us track website conversion success metrics.
    * manage our sales and customer support services to you, including for resolving any disputes.

We enter into confidentiality and data processing terms with partners to ensure they comply with high levels of confidentiality and best practices in privacy and security standards and we regularly review these standards and practices. You can find more information in our [Subprocessor Statement](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/subprocessor-list/?ut_source=legal&ut_source2=privacy&ut_source3=inline).

5\. Data Retention
------------------

If you are a Creator, we generally do not delete the data in your account as long as your account is active – you are responsible for and control the time periods for which you retain this data. You can read about this [here](https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/policy/surveymonkey-data/) for account use. Here are some exceptions: 

* If you are a SurveyMonkey Basic (free) user on our platforms and you have not engaged with the service actively for some time, we reserve the right to delete your account and data in accordance with our data retention policy. 

* If you have exceeded your response limit as a SurveyMonkey Basic (free) account holder, we will delete the overages if you do not upgrade within a fixed timeframe. 

We also encourage Creators to actively review their data retention practices in their account and take care to retain data only as long as is strictly necessary. 

We also describe the expiry periods for cookies on our websites in our [Cookies Notice](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/cookies/?ut_source=legal&ut_source2=privacy&ut_source3=inline). 

6\. Personalized marketing and cookies
--------------------------------------

We and our partners use cookies and similar technologies on our websites. For more information see our [Cookies Notice](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/cookies/?ut_source=legal&ut_source2=privacy&ut_source3=inline). For information about cookies used in our surveys please see [Cookies used on Survey Pages](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/survey-page-cookies/). If you are a customer of SurveyMonkey and separately use cookies or similar technologies in conjunction with any of our products and services, then you yourself will be responsible for complying with any laws related to the use of those technologies and this Privacy Notice is not applicable to that use by you.

You can also choose to remove or disable cookies via your [browser settings](https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/account/opt-out/) and, depending on your geographic location you can withdraw consent to non-essential cookies using the in-product cookie preferences tool.

You can opt-out from direct marketing in your account and we provide opt-out options in all direct marketing emails. Finally, if you do not wish to see personalized marketing content on the web related to our service you can clear the cookies in your browser settings. See our Help Center article on how to do this [here](https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/account/opt-out/). 

7\. Security
------------

We have a security statement related to our self-serve businesses (Momentive, SurveyMonkey and Wufoo) available to view [here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/security/). For information about security related to our other business lines you can speak to a sales representative by completing the form [here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/enterprise/?form_autoload=&ut_source=legal&ut_source2=privacy&ut_source3=inline).

8\. Minors
----------

Our services are not intended for and may not be used by minors. “Minors” are individuals under the age of 16 (or under a higher age as provided in certain countries or territories). SurveyMonkey does not knowingly collect Personal Data from Minors or allow them to register. If it comes to our attention that we have collected Personal Data from a Minor, we may delete this information without notice. If you have reason to believe that this has occurred, please contact customer support.

9\. Data Transfers
------------------

Your information and data may be processed in and transferred or disclosed in the United States and countries in which our affiliates are located and in which our service providers are located or have servers. You can view a list of these locations in our [EU Data Transfer Statement](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/subprocessor-list/). We ensure that the recipient of your Personal Data offers an adequate level of protection, for instance by entering into the appropriate back-to-back agreements with standard contractual clauses or other transfer mechanisms as approved by the European Commission or relevant data protection authority.

We have also provided a [help article](https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/policy/data-processing-agreements-eu/) which answers some additional questions about data transfers to the US.

EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles.

SurveyMonkey Inc. has self-certified its compliance under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension and the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles. SurveyMonkey is committed to subjecting all personal information received from the European Union (EU) member countries, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the Framework’s applicable Principles. To learn more about the DPF, see [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s](https://www.privacyshield.gov/).

SurveyMonkey also complies with the onward transfer liability provisions of the DPF.

When SurveyMonkey receives personal information under the DPF and then transfers it to a third-party service provider acting as agent on SurveyMonkey's behalf, SurveyMonkey has certain liability under the DPF if both (i) the agent processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the DPF and (ii) SurveyMonkey is responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. In certain situations, SurveyMonkey may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

With respect to Personal Data received or transferred pursuant to the DPF, SurveyMonkey is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Please contact SurveyMonkey as described in Section 11 below if you have any concerns or complaints of any nature. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider, (free of charge) at [https://www.jamsadr.com/dpf-dispute-resolution](https://www.jamsadr.com/dpf-dispute-resolution).

Under certain conditions, more fully described on the DPF website [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/How-to-Submit-a-Complaint-Relating-to-a-Participating-Organization-s-Compliance-with-the-DPF-Principles-dpf](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/How-to-Submit-a-Complaint-Relating-to-a-Participating-Organization-s-Compliance-with-the-DPF-Principles-dpf), you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.

10\. Who is my data controller?
-------------------------------

If you have provided survey responses, filled out a form, submitted an application, or provided website feedback to a Creator using SurveyMonkey services, that Creator is the controller of your data, and SurveyMonkey is the processor of that data. 

For SurveyMonkey Enterprise account holders, your organization’s primary administrator controls some basic account level information which you input when setting up your account like name, email address and profile photo.  

If you have provided survey responses, filled out a form, submitted an application, or provided website feedback directly to SurveyMonkey, then SurveyMonkey is the controller and our use of that data is described in our [SurveyMonkey Research Privacy Notice](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/survey-research-privacy-notice/?ut_source=legal&ut_source2=privacy&ut_source3=inline). 

If you are a Creator and have received more responses than your plan allows (“overage data”), SurveyMonkey is the controller over the overage data until you change your plan type, or the overage data is deleted in accordance with section 12.4 of our [Terms of Use](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/terms-of-use/#12.4%20SurveyMonkey%20Basic%20(Free)%20Plan%20Response%20Limits.) or per the terms of your negotiated contract.

SurveyMonkey is a controller for the account-level data provided by its Creators and panelists from Contribute and Rewards.  

11\. Your rights
----------------

You may wish to exercise a right to obtain information about yourself or to correct, update or delete that information. For more information about these rights you can read about it [here](https://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_US/kb/surveymonkey-gdpr). Some of these rights may be subject to some exceptions or limitations in local law. Please note your rights and choices vary depending upon your location. We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity and we will respond to your request to exercise these rights within a reasonable time (and in all cases within 30 days of receiving a request) subject to the below for specific categories of person.

Apply Applicants

For SurveyMonkey Apply users please see [information on how to exercise your rights here](https://help.smapply.io/hc/en-us/articles/360003749013-SurveyMonkey-Apply-Data-Privacy).

* **Creator**
    
    Where you hold an account with any SurveyMonkey service, you are entitled to a copy of all Personal Data which we hold in relation to you. You also may be entitled to request that we restrict how we use your data or object to some aspect of our treatment of your data. You can access a lot of your data in your own account when you log in. If you want to exercise your rights, please contact us [here](https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/contact/?l=en&form=datarequest).
    
    Depending on your plan type, SurveyMonkey also enables you to export your own response data from our system in a variety of formats so that you can back it up or use it with other applications. Alternatively, for assistance in exporting you can contact us.
    
* **Respondent**
    
    Where you have responded to a survey, form, questionnaire or application sent to you by a Creator using a SurveyMonkey service, you will need to reach out directly to that individual or organization to discuss managing, deleting, accessing, restricting access to or otherwise withdrawing consent for use of the information which you provided to them in your responses. SurveyMonkey does not control your response data and, accordingly, is not in a position to directly handle these requests in relation to that data. If you are having difficulties finding this Creator or if you have any other questions after reading this Privacy Notice, you can [contact us](https://help.surveymonkey.com/contact?l=en&form=datarequest) [through](https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/contact/?l=en&form=datarequest) [our support team](https://help.surveymonkey.com/contact?l=en&form=datarequest) and we will try our best to help you.
    
* **Panelist**
    
    If you have created a Rewards or Contribute account with us, you can request a copy of your Personal Data, delete your Personal Data, or correct it. 
    
* **Visitor**
    
    Where you have visited our website and you want to exercise any of the above rights please contact our support team [here](https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/contact/?l=en&form=datarequest). Alternatively, if your request is for the right to be forgotten as it relates only to our use of cookies you can achieve this by clearing the cookies in your browser settings. See our Help Center article describing how to do this [here](https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/account/opt-out/).
    
* **Authorized Agent**
    
    If you are a third party organization acting on behalf of a data subject (or class of data subjects) to exercise data subject rights, we do work with you. In this case:
    
    * We ask you to follow our process outlined in this Privacy Notice for security reasons so that we can independently verify the Creator (if it is a Creator) making any requests to exercise their rights.
    * Where applicable, we directly interact with a Creator’s registered email address, because we authenticate users with username and unique password and not with other identifying information (e.g., photo ID or similar).
    
    **Please do not share other forms of personal identification for data subjects with us when submitting requests.**
    

Other rights and choices

* For rights and choices specific to US consumers, please refer to our [Region Specific Privacy Notice](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/region-specific-privacy-statement/).
