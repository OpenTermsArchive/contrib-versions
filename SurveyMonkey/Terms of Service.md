LAST UPDATED: August 16, 2021

Introduction
------------

These Terms of Use (“TOU”) apply to your access and use of Momentive's products, services, websites, and apps that you purchase or sign up for on Momentive's websites and which are branded as “Momentive”, “SurveyMonkey”, “Wufoo” or “GetFeedback” (collectively the “**Service(s)**”). These TOU do not apply to Services which are available solely through our [enterprise sales](https://www.surveymonkey.com/enterprise/?form_autoload=&ut_source=pricing_page&ut_source2=terms-of-use&ut_source3=inline) channel.

Additional [service-specific terms](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/which-terms-apply/?ut_source=legal&ut_source2=terms-of-use&ut_source3=inline) apply to some Services (“**Service-Specific Terms**”). Certain [country-specific terms](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/country-specific-terms?ut_source=legal&ut_source2=terms-of-use&ut_source3=inline) may also apply to you if you are located outside the United States (“**Country-Specific Terms**”). We refer to the Service-Specific Terms and Country-Specific Terms collectively as “Additional Terms” and the combination of these TOU and any applicable Additional Terms collectively as these “**Terms**.”

You agree to these Terms by clicking to accept these Terms, executing a document that references them, or using the Services.

If you will be using the Services on behalf of an organization, you agree to these Terms on behalf of that organization and you represent that you have the authority to do so. In such case, “you” and “your” will refer to that organization.

1\. Fees and Payments
---------------------

### 1.1 Fees for Services.

You agree to pay to Momentive any fees for each Service you purchase or use (including any overage fees), in accordance with the pricing and payment terms presented to you for that Service. Where applicable, you will be billed using the billing method you select through your account management page. If you have elected to pay the fees by credit card, you represent and warrant that the credit card information you provide is correct and you will promptly notify Momentive of any changes to such information. Fees paid by you are non-refundable, except as provided in these Terms or when required by law.

### 1.2 Subscriptions.

Some of our Services are billed on a subscription basis (we call these “Subscriptions”). This means that you will be billed in advance on a recurring, periodic basis (each period is called a “billing cycle”). Billing cycles are typically monthly or annual, depending on what subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription. Your Subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle unless you cancel auto-renewal through your online account management page, or b**y** [**contacting our customer support team**](https://help.surveymonkey.com/?l=en). **YOU MAY CANCEL AUTO-RENEWAL ON YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AT ANY TIME, IN WHICH CASE YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL CONTINUE UNTIL THE END OF THAT BILLING CYCLE BEFORE TERMINATING.**

### 1.3 Taxes.

Our prices listed do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature such as value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, “**Taxes**”) unless otherwise indicated. You are responsible for paying Taxes associated with your purchase and keeping your billing information up to date.

(a) United States Sales Tax. If we have a legal obligation to pay or collect sales tax for which you are responsible, we will calculate the sales tax based upon the billing information we have about you and charge you that amount (which, if your billing information is incomplete or inaccurate, may be the highest prevailing rate then in effect), unless you timely provide us with a valid tax exemption certificate acceptable to the appropriate taxing authority.

To be timely, you must provide us with a tax exemption certificate before your initial purchase or upgrade, or, if you miss that mark, within 90 days after such purchase or upgrade, unless your billing information is in Alabama, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, or South Carolina in which case within 60 days; or if in Hawaii, Mississippi, or New Mexico within 45 days.

If you provide us with a tax exemption certificate, you represent and warrant that it accurately reflects your tax status and that you will keep such document current and accurate.

If we have collected sales tax from you and subsequently determine in our sole discretion that your tax exemption certificate is valid, we will refund the sales tax collected based on applicable state tax laws.

(b) Non-United States Sales Tax. If applicable, we will charge you VAT, GST or any other sales, consumption or use taxes that arise in connection with your purchases of Momentive Services unless you provide us with a tax identification number that entitles you to an exemption, a valid tax exemption certificate or other documentary proof issued by an appropriate taxing authority that tax should not be charged. If you are located in a jurisdiction with multiple sales, consumption or use taxes, we may charge you the highest prevailing rate if your billing information is incomplete or inaccurate.

If you are required by law to withhold any Taxes from your payments to Momentive, you must provide Momentive with an official tax receipt or other appropriate documentation to support such payments.

### 1.4 Price Changes.

Momentive may change the fees charged to you for the Services at any time, provided that, for Subscriptions, the change will become effective only at the end of the then-current billing cycle of your Subscription. Momentive will provide you with advance notice of any change in fees.

### 1.5 Overage Fees.

Unless otherwise stated, any overage fees incurred by you will be billed in arrears. Overage fees which remain unpaid for 30 days after being billed are considered overdue. Failure to pay overage fees when due may result in the applicable Service being limited, suspended, or terminated (subject to applicable legal requirements), which may result in a loss of your data associated with that Service subject to applicable law.

2\. Privacy
-----------

### 2.1 Privacy.

In the course of using the Services, you may submit content to Momentive (including your personal data and the personal data of others) or third parties may submit content to you through the Services (all of the above will be referred to as your “Content”). We know that by giving us your Content, you are trusting us to treat it appropriately. Momentive’s [Privacy Notice](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/privacy/?ut_source=legal&ut_source2=terms-of-use&ut_source3=inline), together with any Service-specific privacy notices or statements (collectively, “Momentive privacy notices”), detail how we treat your Content and we agree to adhere to those Momentive privacy notices. You in turn agree that Momentive may use and share your Content in accordance with the Momentive privacy notices and applicable data protection laws. You also agree that you are responsible for notifying these third parties about the Momentive privacy notices. Our [Data Processing Agreement](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/data-processing-agreement/?ut_source=legal&ut_source2=terms-of-use&ut_source3=inline) also apply to and are supplemental to these Terms. Where there is a conflict between the Data Processing Agreement and these Terms, the Data Processing Agreement will prevail except with respect to Exclusion and Limitation of Liability where these Terms will prevail.

### 2.2 Confidentiality.

Momentive will treat your Content as confidential information and only use and disclose it in accordance with these Terms (including the Momentive privacy notices). However, your Content is not regarded as confidential information if such Content: (a) is or becomes public (other than through breach of these Terms by Momentive); (b) was lawfully known to Momentive before receiving it from you; (c) is received by Momentive from a third party without knowledge of breach of any obligation owed to you; (d) is shared in the context of your account being identified by you as a business owned account or migrated to an organization’s Enterprise account, if your account is registered using a work email address within that organization; or (e) was independently developed by Momentive without reference to your Content. Momentive may disclose your Content when required by law or legal process, but only after Momentive, if permitted by law, uses commercially reasonable efforts to notify you to give you the opportunity to challenge the requirement to disclose.

### 2.3 Security.

Momentive will store and process your Content in a manner consistent with industry security standards. Momentive has implemented appropriate technical, organizational, and administrative systems, policies, and procedures.

If Momentive becomes aware of any unauthorized or unlawful access to, or acquisition, alteration, use, disclosure, or destruction of, personal data related to your account (“**Security Incident**”), Momentive will take reasonable steps to notify you without undue delay, but in any event within 72 hours of becoming aware of the Security Incident impacting your account. Momentive will also reasonably cooperate with you with respect to any investigations relating to a Security Incident, any required notices, and providing information reasonably requested by you and available to us in relation to any Security Incident, where such information is not already available to you in your account or online through updates provided by Momentive.

3\. Your Content
----------------

### 3.1 You Retain Ownership of Your Content.

You retain ownership of all of your intellectual property rights in your Content. Momentive does not claim ownership over any of your Content. These Terms do not grant us any licenses or rights to your Content except for the limited license described in these Terms.

### 3.2 Limited License to Your Content.

You grant Momentive a worldwide, royalty free license to use, reproduce, distribute, modify, adapt, create derivative works, make publicly available, and otherwise exploit your Content, but only for the limited purposes of providing and improving the Services and as permitted by the Momentive privacy notices. This license for such limited purposes continues even after you stop using our Services, with respect to aggregate and de-identified data derived from your Content and any residual backup copies of your Content made in the ordinary course of Momentive's business (subject to our retention policies). This license also extends to any trusted third parties we work with to the extent necessary to provide and improve the Services.

### 3.3 **Representations and Warranties**.

You represent and warrant that: (a) you own or control the appropriate rights in and to your Content, including any intellectual property owned by third parties; and (b) you will not submit, upload, or otherwise make available via the Services, any Content or materials that are in breach of our [Acceptable Uses Policy](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/acceptable-uses-policy/?ut_source=legal&ut_source2=terms-of-use&ut_source3=inline).

### **3.4** Responsibility for Your Content.

The Services may display content not owned by Momentive but by others.  The entity that makes such content available is responsible for it.  You are responsible for your Content, and you must ensure that you have all the rights and permissions needed to use that Content in connection with the Services.  Momentive is not responsible for any actions you take with respect to your Content, including sharing it publicly. Subject to applicable law, Momentive is not liable for your Content, any other third-party content or materials, or any loss or damage resulting from your use of, or reliance on, such Content or other third-party content or materials. 

You acknowledge that, to ensure compliance with legal obligations, Momentive may be required to review certain of your Content submitted to the Services to determine whether it is illegal or whether it violates these Terms (such as when unlawful content is reported to us). We may also modify, prevent access to, delete, or refuse to display your Content that we believe violates the law or these Terms. In the event your Content includes third-party brands, logos or other source identifiers, we may require you to submit a statement of non-affiliation before you may use such Content in connection with the Services. However, Momentive otherwise has no obligation to monitor or review any content submitted to the Services.

4\. IP Claims
-------------

### 4.1 DMCA Notices or Equivalents.

Momentive responds to notices of alleged copyright infringement in accordance with the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) or equivalent applicable laws and regulations. If you believe that your work has been exploited in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, you may [notify our agent for claims of copyright infringement](https://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_US/kb/Who-is-your-designated-DMCA-agent).

### 4.2 Other IP Claims.

If you believe a Momentive user is infringing upon your intellectual property rights, you may [report it through our online form](https://smforms.wufoo.com/forms/contact-surveymonkey-abuse/). Claims of copyright infringement should follow the process outlined in these Terms, or any equivalent process available under local law.

5\. Momentive IP
----------------

Neither these Terms nor your use of the Services grants you ownership in the Services or the content you access through the Services (other than your Content). Except as permitted by our [Brand and Trademark Use Policy](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/brandassets/), these Terms do not grant you any right to use Momentive’s trademarks or other brand elements.

If you submit any feedback or suggestions to us regarding our Services, we may use and share them for any purpose without any compensation or obligation to you.

6\. Third Party Resources
-------------------------

Momentive may publish links in its Services to internet websites maintained by third parties. Momentive does not represent that it has reviewed such third party websites and is not responsible for them or any content appearing on them. Trademarks displayed in conjunction with the Services are the property of their respective owners.

7\. Account Management
----------------------

### **7**.1 Keep Your Password Secure.

If you have been issued an account by Momentive in connection with your use of the Services, you are responsible for safeguarding your password and any other credentials used to access that account. You, and not Momentive, are responsible for any activity occurring in your account (other than activity that Momentive is directly responsible for which is not performed in accordance with your instructions), whether or not you authorized that activity. If you become aware of any unauthorized access to your account, you should notify Momentive immediately. Accounts may not be shared and may only be used by one individual per account.

### 7.2 Keep Your Email and Account Details Accurate.

Momentive occasionally sends notices to the email address registered with your account. You must keep your email address and, where applicable, your contact details and payment details associated with your account current and accurate.

### **7**.3 Remember to Backup.

You are responsible for maintaining, protecting, and making backups of your Content. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Momentive will not be liable for any failure to store, or for loss or corruption of, your Content.

### **7**.4 Account Inactivity.

Momentive may terminate your account and delete any Content contained in it if there is no account activity (such as a log in event or payment) for over 12 months. However, where appropriate, we will attempt to warn you by email before terminating your account to provide you with an opportunity to log in to your account so that it remains active.

8\. User Requirements
---------------------

### 8.1 Legal Status.

If you are an individual, you may only use the Services if you have the power to form a contract with Momentive. If you do not have the power to form a contract, you may not use the Services. If you are not an individual, you warrant that you are validly formed and existing under the laws of your jurisdiction of formation, that you have full power and authority to enter into these Terms, and that you have duly authorized your agent to bind you to these Terms.

### **8**.2 Minors.

“**Minors**” are individuals under the age of 13 (or under a higher age as provided in certain countries and territories). None of the Services are intended for use by Minors. If you are a Minor in your place of residence, you may not use the Services. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you are not a Minor.

### 8.3 Embargoes.

You may only use the Services if you are not barred under any applicable laws from doing so. If you are located in a country embargoed by United States or other applicable law from receiving the Services or you are on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Denied Persons List or Entity List or the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals, you are not permitted to purchase any paid Services from Momentive. You will ensure that: (a) your end users do not use the Services in violation of any export restriction or embargo by the United States; and (b) you do not provide access to the Services to persons or entities on any of the above lists.

9\. Acceptable Uses Policy
--------------------------

You agree to comply with the [Acceptable Uses Policy](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/acceptable-uses-policy/?ut_source=legal&ut_source2=terms-of-use&ut_source3=inline).

10\. PCI Compliance
-------------------

### 10.1 PCI Standards.

If you use the Services to accept payment card transactions, you must comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS) to the extent they are applicable to your business (the “PCI Standards”). Momentive provides tools to simplify your compliance with the PCI Standards, but you must ensure that your business is compliant and the specific steps you will need to take to comply with the PCI Standards will depend on your implementation of the Services.

### 10.2 Cardholder Data.

Momentive is responsible for the security of Cardholder Data that is collected, transmitted, stored, or processed by us on your behalf. “Cardholder Data” is defined as a cardholder’s primary account number, and where a full unmasked card number is present, any of the cardholder name, expiration date, and/or service code. Momentive has developed strict security features to protect Cardholder Data, and as such this data may only be used in anticipated ways and stored in appropriate places. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE PROHIBITED FROM COLLECTING OR ENTERING CARDHOLDER DATA INTO ANY FORM OR DATA ENTRY FIELDS IN THE SERVICES, EXCEPT INTO THOSE FIELDS INTENDED SOLELY FOR THAT PURPOSE (i.e. where Momentive explicitly enables such data to be entered into such fields). Appropriate fields are clearly marked with labels such as ‘Card number’ or by having a credit card icon precede them. Similarly, excluding payment forms, you must never collect or enter any “**Sensitive Authentication Data**”, as defined by the PCI Standards (including CVC or CVV2) into any fields in the Services. You assume all responsibility for any Cardholder Data entered into the Services in violation of these terms.

11\. Suspension and Termination of Services
-------------------------------------------

### 11.1 By You.

You can terminate your Subscription and delete your account at any time through your account management page. Such termination and deletion will result in the deactivation or disablement of your account and access to it, and the deletion of content you collected through use of the Services. Terminations are confirmed immediately, and you will not be charged again for that Subscription unless you purchase a new one. If you terminate a Subscription in the middle of a billing cycle, you will not receive a refund unless you are terminating these Terms for any of the following reasons: (a) we have materially breached these Terms and failed to cure that breach within 30 days after you have so notified us in writing; (b) a refund is required by law; or (c) we, in our sole discretion, determine a refund is appropriate. For clarity, we will not grant a refund where you have used our Services, collected responses, and/or downloaded your responses unless the termination is due to our material, uncured breach or a refund is required by law.

### 11.2 By Momentive.

**(a)** For Convenience. Momentive may terminate your Subscription effective at the end of a billing cycle by providing at least 30 days’ prior written notice to you without refund for any prior period. Additionally, Momentive may terminate your Subscription at any time during the billing cycle by providing at least 90 days’ written notice to you and will provide a pro rata refund for any period of time you did not use in that billing cycle.

**(b)** For Cause. Momentive may suspend performance or terminate your Subscription for any of the following reasons: (a) you have materially breached these Terms and failed to cure that breach within 30 days after Momentive has so notified you in writing; (b) you cease your business operations or become subject to insolvency proceedings and the proceedings are not dismissed within 90 days; or (c) you fail to pay fees for 30 days past the due date. Additionally, Momentive may limit, suspend, or terminate the Services to you: (i) if you fail to comply with these Terms, (ii) if you use the Services in a way that causes legal liability to us or disrupts others’ use of the Services; or (iii) if we are investigating suspected misconduct by you. Also, if we limit, suspend, or terminate the Services you receive, depending upon the reason, we will endeavor to give you advance notice and an opportunity to obtain a copy of your Content from that Service. However, there may be time sensitive situations where Momentive may decide that we need to take immediate action without notice. Momentive will use commercially reasonable efforts to narrow the scope and duration of any limitation or suspension under this Section as is needed to resolve the issue that prompted such action. Momentive has no obligation to retain your Content upon termination of the applicable Service.

12\. Changes and Updates
------------------------

### 12.1 Changes to Terms.

Momentive may change these Terms at any time for a variety of reasons, such as to reflect changes in applicable law or updates to Services, and to account for new Services or functionality. The most current version will always be posted on the Momentive website. If an amendment is material, as determined in Momentive’s sole discretion, Momentive will notify you by email. Notice of amendments may also be posted upon your login to your account. Except as otherwise specified by us, changes will be effective no sooner than the day they are publicly posted. If you do not want to agree to any changes made to the terms for a Service, you should stop using that Service, because (unless otherwise stated in law) by continuing to use the Services you indicate your agreement to be bound by the updated terms.

### 12.2 Changes to Services.

Momentive constantly changes and improves the Services. Momentive may add, alter, or remove functionality from a Service it provides to you at any time without prior notice. Momentive may also limit, suspend, or discontinue a Service provided to you at its discretion. If Momentive discontinues a Service, we will give you reasonable advance notice to provide you with an opportunity to obtain a copy of your Content from that Service. Momentive may remove content from the Services it provides you at any time in our sole discretion, although we will endeavor to notify you before we do that if it materially impacts you and if practicable under the circumstances.

### 12.3 Downgrades.

Downgrading your account plan may cause the loss of Content, features, functionality, or capacity of your account.

### **12.4 SurveyMonkey Basic (Free) Plan Response Limits**.

Any responses over your SurveyMonkey Basic (free) plan's response limits will not be viewable, and each response over the limit will be deleted 60 days after it is received, unless you upgrade to a SurveyMonkey paid plan to view and keep access to all responses before they are deleted. We encourage you to go to [My Surveys](https://www.surveymonkey.com/home/?ut_source=legal&ut_source2=terms-of-use&ut_source3=inline) to see which surveys have extra responses over your plan's response limit, in case you want to upgrade to a paid plan to view and keep them.

13\. Disclaimers, Limitations of Liability and Indemnification
--------------------------------------------------------------

### 13.1 Disclaimers.

While it is in Momentive’s interest to provide you with a great experience when using the Services, there are certain things we do not promise about them. We try to keep our online Services up, but they may be unavailable from time to time for various reasons. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THESE TERMS AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE SERVICES AND ANY GUIDANCE OR RECOMMENDATIONS THEREIN ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND MOMENTIVE DOES NOT MAKE WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING THOSE OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OR ANY REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING AVAILABILITY, RELIABILITY, OR ACCURACY OF THE SERVICES.

TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF MOMENTIVE (INCLUDING ITS AFFILIATES AND ITS AND THEIR OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, AND LICENSORS) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES AND THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED THE LESSER OF: (A) THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO MOMENTIVE FOR USE OF THE SERVICES AT ISSUE DURING THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY; AND (B) US$200.00.

IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE ABOVE TYPES OF EXCLUSIONS (SECTION 13.2) AND/OR LIMITATIONS (SECTION 13.3) ARE NOT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ARE RESPONSIBLE TO YOU ONLY FOR YOUR LOSSES AND DAMAGES THAT ARE A REASONABLY FORESEEABLE RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO USE ALL REASONABLE SKILL AND CARE OR THAT DIRECTLY RESULT FROM A MATERIAL BREACH OF THESE TERMS.

### 13.4 Consumers.

While our Services are most often used for business, we acknowledge that the laws of certain jurisdictions provide legal rights to consumers that may not be overridden by contract or waived by those consumers. If you are such a consumer using our Services for non-business reasons, nothing in these Terms limits any of those consumer rights.

### 13.5 Indemnification.

If you are a business, you will indemnify and hold harmless Momentive (including its affiliates and its and their officers, agents, and employees) from all liabilities, damages, and costs (including settlement costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of a third party claim regarding or in connection with your or your end users’ use of the Services or breach of these Terms, to the extent that such liabilities, damages and costs were caused by you or your end users.

In the course of using the Wufoo website, you may create certain templates, graphics or form documents (collectively, the “**Form Content**”) and load or post such documents into the Wufoo form gallery (“**Form Gallery**”) for other users. By making such Form Content available on the Form Gallery, you grant to Momentive a worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual, royalty-free, transferable and sub-licensable, non-exclusive right to use, copy, modify, distribute, display, perform, create derivative works and exploit that Form Content in connection with Momentive’s operation of Wufoo.
*   Termination. Momentive may terminate any free Wufoo accounts that do not receive a form submission for 6 months or where the accounts are not accessed for 6 months.
*   Use of API. You may access your Wufoo account data via Wufoo’s application programming interface (“**API**”) and Momentive hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license (without the right to sublicense) to use the API solely as necessary to develop, test, operate and support your software application or website using certain data and content from the Wufoo website (“**Application**”), and to distribute or allow access to your integration of the API within your Application to end users of your Application. Any use of the API, including use of the API through a third party product or service that accesses Wufoo, is bound by these Terms, plus the following specific items:

**(a)** Abuse of the API or excessively frequent requests to Wufoo via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your access to the API. Momentive, in its sole discretion, will determine if your usage constitutes abuse or excessive usage of the API. Momentive will endeavor to warn the account owner via email prior to suspension. While Momentive strives to have the API available without interruption, Momentive cannot guarantee any uptime for the API.

**(b)** You agree not to use the API in any way that is unlawful or harms Momentive, its service providers, your end users, or any other person.

**(c)** Momentive may modify, restrict or discontinue, at any time, temporarily or permanently, your access to the API (or any part thereof) with or without notice.

**(d)** You agree to assist Momentive, at its request, to verify compliance with these Wufoo Terms by providing us with information about your Application, including providing us with access to it and/or other materials related to your use of the API.

**(e)** The API is currently provided for free, but Momentive reserves the right to charge for use of the API in the future. If Momentive charges a fee for use of the API, you do not have any obligation to continue using it.
