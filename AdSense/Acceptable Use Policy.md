[](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1282103?hl=en&ref_topic=1250104)[Next: Google Publisher Restrictions](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9335567?hl=en&ref_topic=1250104)

Google helps to enable a free and open web by helping publishers monetize their content and advertisers reach prospective customers with useful, relevant products and services. Maintaining trust in the ads ecosystem requires setting limits on what we will monetize.

When you monetize your content with Google ad code you are required to adhere to the following policies. By content we mean anything present on your page or app - including other advertisements and links to other sites or apps. Failure to comply with these policies may result in Google blocking ads from appearing against your content, or suspending or terminating your account.

These restrictions apply in addition to any other policies governing your use of Google publisher products.

Privacy related policies
------------------------

### Privacy disclosures

Publishers must:

*   have and abide by a privacy policy that clearly discloses any data collection, sharing and usage that takes place on any site, app, email publication or other property as a consequence of your use of Google products. The privacy policy must disclose to users that third parties may be placing and reading cookies on your users' browsers, or using web beacons to collect information as a result of ad serving on your website.
    
    To comply with this disclosure obligation with respect to Google’s use of data, you have the option to display a prominent link to [How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/).
    

### Cookies on Google domains

Publishers must:

*   not set a cookie on Google's domains or modify, intercept or delete cookies set on Google's domains.

### Identifying users

Publishers must:

*   not use device fingerprints or locally shared objects (e.g., Flash cookies, Browser Helper Objects, HTML5 local storage) other than HTTP cookies, or user-resettable mobile device identifiers designed for use in advertising
*   not pass any information to Google data that Google could use or recognize as personally identifiable information; or that permanently identifies a particular device (such as a mobile phone's unique device identifier if such an identifier cannot be reset).
*   not use our services to identify users or facilitate the merging of personally identifiable information with information previously collected as non-personally identifiable information without robust notice of, and the user's prior affirmative (i.e., opt-in) consent to, that identification or merger. Irrespective of users' consent, you must not attempt to disaggregate data that Google reports in aggregate.
    
    For more information, please refer to [Guidance for complying with the Identifying Users Policy](https://support.google.com/adsense/topic/6162392).
    
*   comply with the [EU user consent policy](http://www.google.com/about/company/user-consent-policy.html).

### Use of device and location data

If publishers collect, process, or disclose information that identifies or can be used to infer an end user's precise geographic location, such as sourced from GPS, wifi or cell tower data then,

Publishers must:

*   disclose to the user, via an interstitial or just-in-time notice, the purposes for which their data may be used (including, ad personalization, analytics, and attribution, as applicable), including that the data may be shared with partners;

### Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)

Google relies on the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for transfers of online advertising and measurement personal data out of the European Economic Area, the UK, or Switzerland. For [Processor Services](https://privacy.google.com/businesses/adsservices/), the [Google Ads Data Processing Terms](https://privacy.google.com/businesses/processorterms/) include the [SCCs for transfers of personal data to processors established in third countries](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32010D0087). For Controller Services, the [Google Ads Controller-Controller Data Protection Terms](https://privacy.google.com/businesses/controllerterms/) include the [SCCs for transfers of personal data to controllers established in third countries](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32004D0915). Where there is a relevant transfer of personal data, the SCCs incorporated into partner’s contract with Google apply.

If partner processes personal data that originated in the European Economic Area, UK, or Switzerland and that is made available by Google in connection with partner's use of Google Ad Manager, then:

*   partner must only use that personal data in a manner consistent with the consent provided by the data subject to whom it relates;
*   partner must provide a level of protection for that personal data that is at least equivalent to that required under the SCCs; and
*   if partner determines that it cannot comply with the above requirements, partner must notify Google in writing, and either cease processing the personal data or take reasonable and appropriate steps to remedy such non-compliance.

### Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)

If you implement any Google advertising service on a site or section of a site that is covered by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), you must:

*   notify Google of those sites or sections of sites covered by COPPA using the [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/coppa), tag the ad request using the [AdMob SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admob/android/targeting) , or tag your site, app, or ad request for child-directed treatment;

    *   past or current activity by users known by you to be under the age of 13 years or
    *   past or current activity on sites directed at users under the age of 13 years.
