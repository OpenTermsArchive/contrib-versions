Google Publisher Policies
=========================

[](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1282103?hl=en&ref_topic=1250104)[Next: Google Publisher Restrictions](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/10437795?hl=en&ref_topic=1250104)

**(March 23, 2022)** Due to the war in Ukraine, we will pause monetization of content that exploits, dismisses, or condones the war.

**(March 10, 2022)** Given the recent suspension of Google advertising systems in Russia, we’ll be pausing the creation of new Russian accounts on AdSense, AdMob, and Google Ad Manager. Additionally, we will pause ads on Google properties and networks globally for advertisers based in Russia.

**(March 3, 2022)** Due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, we will be temporarily pausing ads from serving to users located in Russia.

**(February 26, 2022)** In light of the war in Ukraine, we are pausing Google’s monetization of Russian Federation state-funded media. 

**We will continue to actively monitor the situation and make adjustments as necessary.**

We are in the process of migrating and consolidating all of the Google Publisher Policies and Google Publisher Restrictions to the new [Publisher Policies Help Center](https://support.google.com/publisherpolicies). For now, you can still view all the policies in the [AdMob](https://support.google.com/admob/), [AdSense](https://support.google.com/adsense/), and [Ad Manager](https://support.google.com/admanager/) Help Centers, as well as the new Help Center. 

When you monetize your content with Google ad code you are required to adhere to the following policies. Failure to comply with these policies may result in Google blocking ads from appearing against your content, or suspending or terminating your account.

These policies apply in addition to any other policies governing your use of Google publisher products.

Google helps to enable a free and open web by helping publishers monetize their content and advertisers reach prospective customers with useful, relevant products and services. Maintaining trust in the ads ecosystem requires setting limits on what we will monetize.

Google Publisher Policies are organized into the following categories:

*   [Content policies](#content) 
*   [Behavioral policies](#behavioral) 
*   [Privacy-related policies](#privacy)
*   [Requirements and other standards](#standards) 

Learn more about the commonly used policy terms and what they mean in the [glossary](https://support.google.com/publisherpolicies/table/10563033).
