SPECIFIC TERMS

1.  **THE AMAZON DEMAND PROGRAM SPECIFIC TERMS**
    
    Amazon Demand is a Program that allows you to place Programmatic Ads and non-Programmatic Ads on the Sites in order to earn advertising fees paid by us for Ads provided by us or on behalf of third party advertisers who participate in Amazon Ads (collectively, “**Amazon Demand**”). “**Amazon Ads**” is an Amazon service that allows third party advertisers to reach Amazon users on Sites which is currently described [here](https://advertising.amazon.com/solutions/products/amazon-dsp). “**Programmatic Ads**” means Ads placed through our ad integration that enables the purchase of advertising inventory on Sites. For the avoidance of doubt, Programmatic Ads does not include real time buying through ad exchanges or other intermediaries.
    
    1.  **Terms Applicable to Programmatic or Non-Programmatic Ads**
        1.  **Ad Placement and Positioning**
            
            1.  **Compliance with Ad Requirements.** Unless we request otherwise in writing, Ads will run solely on Sites that are approved by us in advance in writing.
                
            2.  **No Pop-ups; Video Ads.** You will not deliver any Ad on or within any pop-up or pop-under windows. The sound of video Ads may be end user-initiated on click but may not be otherwise muted by the video player or by you. You will comply with the [Video Policy](https://ams.amazon.com/webpublisher/apsmanaged/apsprogrampolicy.html#2) with respect to all Ads that appear or play on Your Properties.
                
        2.  **Removal of Ads; Modification of Ads.** You reserve the right to reject or remove any Ads that do not comply with your generally applied policies or any applicable Laws. You will remove non-Programmatic Ads from the Site within 24 hours of our request. You will not edit or modify the Ads in any way.
            
        3.  **Payment.** We will not pay you for Ineligible Events (as determined in our sole discretion) and if we identify Ineligible Events after we have paid you, we reserve the right to adjust future payments accordingly. Payments will be made in USD, local currency or any other currency agreed in advance between the Parties. The exchange rate (if applicable) will be based on the data supplied to us by Bloomberg (or a similarly reputable provider if we decide to change it) in the form of average monthly exchange rate for a given month. If applicable, we may deduct any currency conversion fees paid in connection with currency exchange. "**Ineligible Events**" means (i) impressions generated through automated or other invalid means (ii) Ads that are not properly displayed or played by you or (iii) Ads placed in violation of the [Editorial Adjacency Policy](https://ams.amazon.com/webpublisher/apsmanaged/apsprogrampolicy.html#1).
            
        4.  **Indemnification.** We agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless you and your Affiliates and Representatives from Losses resulting from any Claims brought by a third party and resulting from any Ad (excluding Custom Content) to the extent used by you in accordance with these Amazon Demand Program Specific Terms.
            
        5.  **Use and Disclosure of Collected Data by You.** You will not use or disclose Collected Data for any other purpose than to perform your obligations under these Amazon Demand Program Specific Terms; provided, further, that your disclosure of Collected Data is limited to your service providers who are bound by confidentiality, non-use and disclosure obligations at least as restrictive as those imposed on you in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, you will not (i) use Collected Data to (x) retarget a user or append data to a user’s non-public profile or (y) improve Ad targeting and performance on behalf of any other advertiser or on your behalf or (ii) disclose Collected Data to any third party. Notwithstanding the above, you may disclose Collected Data to third parties on an Aggregated and Anonymous basis, provided that such third parties are bound by confidentiality, non-use and disclosure obligations at least as restrictive as those imposed on you in this Agreement. Collected Data is Amazon’s Confidential Information. “**Aggregated and Anonymous**” means a form in which Collected Data is combined with data from numerous other advertisers, provided that Collected Data will not exceed 10% of the total amount of that combined data and such combined data precludes identification, directly or indirectly, of us, end users, our advertisers, brand, product, context, or category. “**Collected Data**” means all data collected, received, provided, derived or otherwise used by us in the performance of this Agreement, including (i) ad response data (such as Ad content, Ad category and the fact that we delivered an Ad to a specific user), (ii) bid price for any Ad, (iii) Performance Data, (iv) the URL, domain or content of the destination page of any Ads; (v) campaign details associated with us (such as ad pricing information or Ad targeting information), but excluding Site Data. 
            
        6.  **Serving and Tracking.** If both Parties are tracking delivery, the controlling measurement used for calculating advertising fees will be our ad server. We will provide you with placement-level activity reports on a monthly basis. If the difference between the controlling measurement and the other measurement exceeds 10% over the month and the controlling measurement is lower, the Parties will try to resolve the discrepancy in good faith. If this is unsuccessful, we reserve the right to pay you based on our ad server’s reported data.
            
        7.  **Taxes.** You may charge and we will pay applicable national, state or local sales or use taxes or value added taxes that you are legally obligated to charge (“**Taxes**”), provided that such Taxes are stated on the original tax invoice that you provide to us and your tax invoice states such Taxes separately and meet the requirements for a valid tax invoice. We may provide you with an exemption certificate or equivalent information acceptable to the relevant taxing authority, in which case, you will not charge and or collect the Taxes covered by such certificate. We may deduct or withhold any taxes that we may be legally obligated to deduct or withhold from any amounts payable to you under these Amazon Demand Program Specific Terms, and payment to you as reduced by such deductions or withholdings will constitute full payment and settlement to you of amounts payable under these Amazon Demand Program Specific Terms. Throughout the term of these Amazon Demand Program Specific Terms, you will provide us with any forms, documents, or certifications as may be required by us to satisfy any information reporting or withholding tax obligations with respect to any payments under these Amazon Demand Program Specific Terms.
            
    2.  **Terms Applicable to Programmatic Ads**
        1.  **Ad Integration.** You will enable our ad integration mechanism on your Sites pursuant to the applicable Program Materials in order to send us ad requests. If, following an ad request, we determine that we will respond, we will send an ad response that will include a price point within the range we established.
            
        2.  **Payment for Advertising Fees.** We will make payment within 60 days from the end of the calendar month during which the advertising fees were earned.
            
        3.  **Campaign Details.** Campaign details will be agreed upon via email between the Parties. However, the Parties may decide to enter into an IO to cover the campaign details. In such case, Section 3(a) of the Terms Applicable to Non-Programmatic Ads will apply.
            
    3.  **Terms Applicable to Non-Programmatic Ads**
        1.  **Insertion Orders.** The Parties will set forth campaign details on an IO. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms of any IO and these Amazon Demand Program Specific Terms, the terms of the IO will prevail. “IO” means a mutually agreed insertion order between the Parties under which you will deliver Ads on Sites.
            
        2.  **Compliance with Ad Requirements; Compliance with Editorial Adjacency Policy.** You will comply with all Ad placement requirements and restrictions, and you will create a reasonably balanced delivery schedule. If Ads are damaged or otherwise unacceptable, you will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify us within 2 days of receipt. Should any Ad appear or play any Site in violation of the [Editorial Adjacency Policy](https://ams.amazon.com/webpublisher/apsmanaged/apsprogrampolicy.html#1), you will, within 24 hours of the earlier of notice or discovery of the violation, remove the Ad or otherwise correct the violation. If the violation of [Editorial Adjacency Policy](https://ams.amazon.com/webpublisher/apsmanaged/apsprogrampolicy.html#1) results in under-delivery, section 3(k) of the Terms Applicable to Non-Programmatic Ads will apply.
            
        3.  **Changes to Site.** You will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide us at least 10 days prior notice of any material changes to the Sites including changes to the size or the placement of an Ad.
            
        4.  **Technical Specifications; Ad Rotation.** You will submit to us final technical specifications within two 2 days of the start of a campaign. Changes by you to the specifications of a campaign that has already started will allow us to suspend delivery of the affected Ad in order for (i) us to send a revised Ad; (ii) you to change the Ad at your cost, and with final creative approval by us; or (iii) us to accept a comparable replacement. Such suspension will not impact the end date of the campaign. We will have the right to rotate Ads without prior notice to you.
            
        5.  **Indemnification.** You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless us and our Representatives from Losses resulting from any Claims brought by a third party and resulting from Custom Content (defined below) provided by you that (i) violates any applicable Law; or (ii) is defamatory or obscene. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you will not be liable for any Losses resulting from Claims to the extent that such Claims result from your customization of Ads based upon detailed specifications provided by us.
            
        6.  **Advertising Fees; Invoices**
            
            1.  **Cost Type.** The IO will set forth the cost type agreed to by the Parties. Cost type may include: flat fee, cost per thousand (“**CPM**”), cost per click (“**CPC**”), cost per engagement (“CPE”) and cost per completed view (“**CPCV**”). In the event the campaign includes CPM placement, we will pay you the CPM rate agreed to by the Parties in the IO for each thousand impressions you serve during the campaign. In the event the campaign includes CPC placement, we will pay you the CPC rate agreed to by the Parties in the IO each time that a user clicks on an impression you serve during the campaign. In the event the campaign includes CPE placement, we will pay you the CPE rate agreed to by the Parties in the IO each time that a user engages with an experience (as set forth in the IO) you serve during the campaign.
