##### Arbitration & Waiver of Class Action

For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000, either party may elect to resolve the dispute in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. In the event a party elects arbitration, they shall initiate such arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution (“ADR”) provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (1) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (2) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (3) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Any dispute resolution proceedings, whether in arbitration or court, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class or representative action or as a named or unnamed member in a class, consolidated, representative or private attorney general legal action.

* * *

##### Law & Jurisdiction

These Terms of Service shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of California without giving effect to any conflicts of laws principles that require the application of the law of a different jurisdiction. You agree that any claim or dispute you may have against Mix must be resolved by a court located in San Francisco County, California, except as otherwise agreed by the parties or as in the arbitration option. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within San Francisco County, California for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.

* * *

##### Other Provisions

These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and Mix with respect your use of the Services and supersede and replace all prior or contemporaneous communications or agreements, written or oral, including any prior versions of the Terms of Service. These Terms of Service do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights on any person or entity. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision or portion of these Terms of Service to be unenforceable, the remainder of the Terms of Service will continue in full force and effect. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms of Service will be effective only if in writing and signed by Mix. The provisions of these Terms of Service that by their nature are continuing will survive any termination.
