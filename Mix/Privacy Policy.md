If you personalize your Mix account, we will also collect any information you provide, such as your full name, your photo or avatar and any optional information you decide to supply about yourself and your interests. We will first seek your specific permission before we gain any access to your contacts should you wish to enable sharing through the Services.

##### Does Mix Use Cookies or Other Tracking Methods?

On the Mix Site, Mix and Third Parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on our Services may use cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and other technologies (**"Technologies"**) to automatically collect information through the Services. We use Technologies that are essentially small data files placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other devices (referred to collectively as a **"device"**) that allow us to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our Sites, Services, applications, messaging, and tools, and to recognize you across devices.

* **Cookies.** Cookies are small text files placed in visitors' computer browsers to store their preferences. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, the Site may not work properly.
    
* **Pixel Tags/Web Beacons.** A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded on the Site that collects information about users' engagement on that web page. The use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement.
    
* **Social Media Widgets.** Our Site includes social media features such as the Facebook "Like" button and LinkedIn (that might include widgets such as the share this button or other interactive mini-programs). These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. These social media features are either hosted by a Third Party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
    
    The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt out of receiving targeted ads from data partners and other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can access these and learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy by visiting the [Network Advertising Initiative](https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp),[the Digital Advertising Alliance](https://www.aboutads.info/choices/),[the European Digital Advertising Alliance](https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/), and [the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada](https://youradchoices.ca/choices/).
    
    Please note, you must opt out separately on each browser and on each device.
    
* **Analytics.** We may also use Google Analytics and Google Analytics Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting to collect information regarding visitor behavior and visitor demographics on some of our Services, and to develop website content. This analytics data is not tied to any Personal Information. For more information about Google Analytics, please visit [https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/). You can opt out of Google's collection and Processing of data generated by your use of the Services by going to [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).
    

Our uses of such Technologies fall into the following general categories:

* **Operationally Necessary.** We may use Technologies that are necessary to the operation of our Site, Services, applications, and tools.

* **Performance Related.** We may use cookies, web beacons, or other similar technologies to assess the performance of our Site, Services, applications, and tools, including as part of our analytic practices to help us understand how our visitors use our Sites, determine if you have interacted with our messaging, determine whether you have viewed an item or link, or to improve our Site content, Services, applications, or tools;

**Your Options:** Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies and tracking pixels. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being set. Instructions to remove persistent cookies can be found through outside resources. Mobile devices may contain settings that allow you to disable tracking, analytics and/or location data. Be aware, however, that if you choose to disable cookies or opt out of tracking or disengage similar features on your mobile device, some areas of the Services may not be optimized for your use, you may not be able to access any or all of the functionality of the Services, and your experience using the Services will be limited.

Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information.

**Service Providers.** We may employ Third Party companies and individuals to facilitate our Services, to provide the Services on our behalf, to perform maintenance and research services, or to assist us in analyzing how our Services are used (such as infrastructure providers, database management, web or mobile analytics and improvement of the Services' features).

**Business Transfers & Affiliates.** Mix may share Personal Information with our business partners, and affiliates for our and our affiliates' internal business purposes or to provide you with a product or service that you have requested. Mix may also provide Personal Information to business partners with whom we may jointly offer products or services, or whose products or services we believe may be of interest to you. In such cases, our business partner's name will appear, along with Mix. Mix requires our affiliates and business partners to agree in writing to maintain the confidentiality and security of Personal Information they maintain on our behalf and not to use it for any purpose other than the purpose for which Mix provided them.

If Mix or the assets of Mix are acquired by another company, or if Mix is involved in financing due diligence processes or transition of service to another service provider, then we may transfer your information, including Personal Information, in connection with that acquisition or sale or transaction and Mix will direct the recipient of this information to assume the rights and obligations described in this Privacy Policy.

**Marketing -- Interest-Based Advertising and Third Party Marketing.** Through our Services, we may allow Third-Party advertising partners to set tracking tools (e.g., cookies) to collect information regarding your activities (e.g., your IP address, page(s) visited, time of day). We may also share such de-identified information as well as selected Personal Information (such as demographic information) we have collected with Third-Party advertising partners. These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you when you visit non-Mix related websites within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as "interest-based advertising" or "online behavioral advertising. We may allow access to other data collected by the Site to facilitate transmittal of information that may be useful, relevant, valuable or otherwise of interest to you.

* * *

##### How Do I Opt Out?

**General.** You have the right to opt out of certain uses and disclosures of your Personal Information. Where you have consented to Mix's Processing of your Personal Information, you may withdraw that consent at any time and opt-out to further Processing by contacting us [here](mailto:support@mix.com). Even if you opt-out, we may still collect and use non-Personal Information regarding your activities on our Sites and/or information from the advertisements on Third-Party websites for non-interest based advertising purposes, such as to determine the effectiveness of the advertisements.

**Email.** If you receive an unwanted email from us, you can use the unsubscribe link found at the bottom of the email to opt-out of receiving future emails. We will process your request within a reasonable time after receipt. Note that you will continue to receive transaction-related emails regarding products or services you have requested. We may also send you certain non-promotional communications regarding Mix and our Services and you will not be able to opt out of those communications (e.g., communications regarding updates to our Terms or this Privacy Policy).

**Mobile Devices.** Mix may occasionally send you push notifications through our mobile applications and other notices that may be of interest to you. You may at any time opt-out from receiving these types of communications by changing the settings on your mobile device. Mix may also collect location-based information if you use our mobile applications. You may opt-out of this collection by changing the settings on your mobile device.

**"Do Not Track."** Do Not Track (**"DNT"**) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. Please note that we do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers.

**Cookies and Interest-Based Advertising.** As noted above, you may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. Please note that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. However, on many mobile devices, application users may opt out of certain mobile ads via their device settings.

The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt-out of receiving targeted ads from our data partners and our other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can access these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at [https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt\_out.asp](https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) or [www.youronlinechoices.eu](https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) and [www.aboutads.info/‌choices/](https://www.aboutads.info/choices/). You can also choose not to be included in Google Analytics [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

To be clear, whether you are using our opt-out or an online industry opt-out, these cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt-out on each device. Advertisements on Third-Party websites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this Privacy Policy may have been directed to you based on anonymous, non-Personal Information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt-out of the advertising partners' use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes.

* **Request Correction** of your Personal Information where it is inaccurate or incomplete. In some cases, we may provide self-service tools that enable you to update your Personal Information;
* **Request Deletion** of your Personal Information; 
* **Request to Opt-Out of Certain Processing Activities** including, as applicable, if we process your Personal Information for "targeted advertising" (as "targeted advertising" is defined by applicable privacy laws), if we "sell" your Personal Information (as "sell" is defined by applicable privacy laws), or if we engage in "profiling" in furtherance of certain "decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects" concerning you (as such terms are defined by applicable privacy laws). For clarity, Mix does not currently engage in "targeted advertising," "selling" or "profiling."; and
* **Appeal our Decision** to decline to Process your request.
