The Services may contain names, logos, text, images, audio/visual works, icons and scripts owned or licensed by We Heart It (**“We Heart It Content”**). We Heart It is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between you and We Heart It, We Heart It owns and retains all rights in We Heart It Content and the Services. However, we do not claim any ownership in the Content you or our other users Post.

_Your Limited Right to Access and Use the Services._ We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable right to access and use the Services for lawful purposes in accordance with these Terms of Service for the term and subject to the restrictions set out in the respective Services descriptions.

_User Content License and ReHearting of User Posted Content._ When you Post Content through our Services (including User Contributions and/or any Content you have Hearted), you give We Heart It, its affiliates and its third-party providers and partners a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable right and license to use, host, store, cache, reproduce, publish, display (publicly or otherwise), perform (publicly or otherwise), distribute, transmit, modify, adapt (including, without limitation, in order to conform it to the requirements of any networks, devices, services, or media through which the Services are available), copy and create derivative works of such Content (either alone or as part of a collective work).

_Survival of User Content License._ Because of the social nature of Content shared through our Services, when you Post something publicly on or through the Services, others may choose to add descriptive commentary and tags to your Content and/or to ReHeart your Content, making your Content part of a social conversation that cannot later be erased without retroactively censoring the speech of others and/or removing Content from another user’s profile. You may adjust your privacy settings to make certain portions of your profile private, but the content that you post will still be available through our Services, and others may choose to add descriptive commentary and tags to your Content and/or to ReHeart your Content. As such, and in order to maintain the integrity of the Services, you agree that the rights that you have granted under the User Content License will continue to survive in perpetuity even if you stop using the Services or your account is otherwise terminated.

_Persistence of User-Licensed Content._ Upon termination of your Account or upon your deletion of any Content from the Services, We Heart It shall make reasonable efforts to disassociate such Content from your User Account; however, you acknowledge and agree that:

(i) caching of, copies of, or references to such Content may not be immediately removed

(ii) such removed Content may persist in backups for a reasonable period of time and

(iii) such removed Content may continue to be publicly available (and stored on our or third party servers) through the accounts of other users, if the same has been ReHearted.

Virtual Items shall be due for payment immediately after confirmation of the order. Virtual Items have a period of validity as described in the Services. You agree that the virtual value of any Virtual Item does not correspond or equate to any real-life monetary value, credit balance, or currency.

If there is a conflict between the provisions of this Part C of the Terms of Service and the provisions of Part A or Part B of the Terms of Service, the provisions of this Part C of the Terms of Service shall take precedence.

**I. Indemnification**

You hereby agree to defend, indemnify and hold us, our business partners, third-party suppliers and providers, licensors, officers, directors, employees, distributors and agents (collectively, the **“Indemnified Parties”**) harmless from and against any damages, losses, liabilities, settlements, and expenses (including without limitation costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred by the Indemnified Parties) in connection with any claim or action that:

(i) arises from any alleged breach by you of these Terms of Service or any representations, warranties and/or covenants contained herein

(ii) arises from the Content or effects of any messages you Post using our Services, or

(iii) otherwise arises from or relates to your use of our Services.

In addition, you acknowledge and agree that the Indemnified Parties have the right to seek damages from you when you use our Services for unlawful purposes, in an unlawful manner, and/or in a manner inconsistent with these Terms of Service. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree that these damages may include, without limitation, direct, indirect, special, incidental, cover, reliance and/or consequential damages.

**II. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution**

In order to expedite the resolution of disputes and control related costs, you and We Heart It agree that any legal or equitable claim relating to these Terms of Service (referred to as a **“Claim”**) will be resolved as set forth in this Governing Law and Dispute Resolution Section.

_Informal Resolution and Written Notice of Claim._ You and We Heart It agree that we will first try to resolve any Claim informally by giving informal written notice prior to initiating any formal proceeding (including litigation or other legal proceeding). Accordingly, neither of us may start a formal proceeding for at least thirty (30) days after one of us notifies the other of a Claim in writing (**“Notice of Claim”**). If We Heart It has a Claim against you, we will send our Notice of Claim to your email address. If you believe you have a Claim against us, You will send your Notice of Claim to [\[email protected\]](https://weheartit.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) with “Notice of Claim” clearly indicated in the subject line.

_Arbitration._ **Please read this carefully. It affects your rights.** We Heart It and you (such references include our respective predecessors in interest, successors and assigns) agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service between We Heart It and you. The arbitration shall be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Terms of Service, and shall be administered by the AAA. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this arbitration clause, but the arbitrator is bound by these Terms of Service. Except as otherwise provided for herein, We Heart It will pay all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought is improper or not warranted, as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), then the payment of all such fees shall be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse We Heart It for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator grants relief to you that is equal to or greater than the value of your demand, We Heart It shall reimburse you for your reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses incurred for the arbitration. **You agree that, by entering into these Terms of Service, you and We Heart It are waiving the right to a trial by jury. You and We Heart It agree that YOU AND We Heart It MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.** Further, you agree that the arbitrator may not consolidate proceedings or more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding, and that if this specific proviso is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration clause shall be null and void.

_Formal Resolution._ If we cannot resolve a Claim informally, you and We Heart It each agree to submit to personal jurisdiction in New York and agree that any and all Claims either of us asserts shall be exclusively brought in the appropriate state or federal court in the Southern District of the State of New York, provided that neither you nor We Heart It shall be precluded from filing a Claim in small claims court, regardless of whether such small claims court is located in New York, for disputes within the jurisdiction of a small claims court.

_Governing Law and Jurisdictional Issues._ **These Terms of Service are governed in all respects by the substantive laws of the State of New York and of the United States of America.** The UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly disclaimed. Those who choose to access our Services from other locations do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.
