An identifiable natural person is a person who can be identified, directly or indirectly.  Personal Information includes data such as your name and email address, but is not limited to this information and may vary based on the Services you are using. Personal Information may also include data like your IP address, information about your usage of our Services, financial or transactional details, user identifiers, your location, or other application specific information When you contact our customer support services, this may include a record of that correspondence and associated contact information.

**_Personal Information That You Provide_**

_Registering and Paying for the Services._ Where applicable, you may sign up to use the Services directly via the Site or Application or via certain third party social networking sites (each, a “Social Networking Site”). If you decide to create an account to use the Services via a Social Networking Site, we may extract the Personal Information you have provided to such Social Networking Site (such as your “real” name, email address and other information you make available via the Social Networking Site) from the account you have with such Social Networking Site and use that Personal Information to create your We Heart It account, or an account for a We Heart It Service; the Personal Information we extract may depend on the privacy settings you have with the Social Networking Site. We use this Personal Information with your consent. 

  

If you choose to purchase any Services or any virtual goods as part of your use of the Services, to the extent available, we or our third party service providers may collect Personal Information from you to facilitate your payment for such virtual goods. We use this Personal Information to perform our contract with you to provide the Services to you. 

  

We use other Personal Information that you provide in connection with your registration and/or use of the Services (e.g., your name, user name, password, time of registration, birthday, gender, zip code (on its own) and individual preferences) in order to provide our Services and your user account to you. If you participate in a contest, we may use any Personal Information included in your submission. We may also use any Personal Information that you include in any inquiry that you send to us. We use the aforementioned Personal Information to perform our contract with you to provide the Services to you. 

  

_Optional Push Notifications._ If you wish to receive push notifications on your cell phone, we may use your user ID, the content of the push notifications we send to you and your user preferences that trigger the push notification. We use this Personal Information with your consent. You can always opt-out for the future.

  

_Email and Marketing Communications._ If you wish to receive personalized email newsletters, we may use your name, email address and the content of the marketing communications we send to you. We send you our personalized email newsletters on the basis of your consent or our legitimate interests to send you information about similar Services to those that you have previously used or purchased. We may personalize our marketing communications based on the information you provide to us, your preferences, your interactions with the Services, information obtained from third parties, and your search and booking history. You can always opt out for the future. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update your “user preferences” information. (See “**Your Rights**,” below.) Please note that where you opt-out of receiving email newsletters, we may still send you certain communications relating to your use of the Services, such as service announcements, notices regarding the Service and administrative messages. 

  

_Information from Your Device You Permit Us to Access as Part of the Services._ With your consent, we may access Personal Information from your device, such as your specific or general location, calendar, or photo library in order to provide Services you have requested. For example, if you are using a weather app and would like to receive weather updates for your current location, you may need to enable access to your location. Similarly, if you are using a calendar app and would like to use the app to manage your calendar, you may need to enable access to your calendar for that purpose. Or if you are using a photo editing app, you may need to enable access to your photos if order for the app to modify your photos. We will not seek to access the category of information described in this paragraph without your consent, and we will not ask for your consent unless it is useful or necessary to provide the Services you have requested. 

  

_Secure Data._ Some services are encrypted and collect data that we are not capable of decrypting under any circumstances. For these services, this includes all or select information stored in your accounts and is associated with your login credentials and your device. We have no way of accessing or providing decrypted Secure data, and we never receive copies of unencrypted Secure data. Your secure data is your property.

You are responsible for maintaining your credentials and managing access to your secure data, as outlined in Section XI. 

  

**_Personal Information We Collect Automatically_**

Our Services may require additional information or permissions from your device in order to function effectively.  

_Log Data_. When you use the Services, whether as a registered user or a non-registered user, for example in accessing our Services through a Social Networking Site, (any of these, a **“We Heart It User”**), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or application (**“Log Data”**).

This Log Data may include Personal Information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type or the website or application you were visiting before you came to the Service, pages of the websites or application involved in the Service that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for, access times and dates, operating system, software version, and statistical information related to your use of the Services. We use the Log Data to monitor and analyze use of the Services, to technically administer and maintain the Services, to provide the Services to you, to improve and increase the functionality and user-friendliness of our Services, and for security purposes. For example, some of the Log Data is collected so that when you use our Services again, it will recognize you and will make your continued use of the Services easier (e.g. by storing your game progress or remembering that you are logged into the Services). We also use the Log Data to verify that visitors to the Service meet the criteria required to process their requests. We use the Log Data to perform our contract with you to provide the functioning Services to you.

**_Third-Party Advertisers._** 

Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information; Advertisers. We may share aggregated information that does not include Personal Information and we may otherwise disclose Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes.

  

In particular, we share Non-Identifying Information (including the advertising identifier currently associated with your device) and Log Data and other aggregated information with third party advertising and technology companies. The data we share with them may include data about your device, approximate location, and use of our Applications, including IP address, device identifiers and information, Application usage data, and purchase data as well as information you provide to us when using our Applications such as game progress and certain technical information. Such information may be used to send you targeted advertisements for products and services that are relevant to your interests. In some cases these third parties will also use the data that they collect for their own purposes, such as aggregating your data with other data they hold in order to inform advertising related services provided to other clients. These third parties may place a Cookie on your browser, or use a web beacon, to collect information about your use of our website so that they can provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interest. That advertising may appear across the Services, or on other websites, apps and services. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting a Cookie from the websites you visit. On your mobile device, you can manage your privacy preferences in app settings, and you may be able to reset some identifiers by taking the following steps (for iOS: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074 and for Android: https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en). If you do not accept Cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the website or all functionality of our Services, and advertising will no longer be targeted to your interests.

  

For example, we may collect and share the advertising identifier associated with your device (such as the Apple IDFA and Android Advertising ID) with advertisers. An advertising identifier is an alphanumeric string that can be used to identify your device so that advertisers can serve relevant ads to you. We use the Apple IDFA only as permitted by Apple, and we use the Android Advertising ID only as permitted by Google. An advertising identifier is assigned, and ad tracking is turned on, by default on your mobile device. You may limit the use of or reset your advertising device ID using the privacy settings on your mobile device; in some instances you may need to reset the operating system to reset the advertising device ID. We do not associate any of your personal information with your advertising device ID without your consent (which may be given by you in our terms of use for an Application).

**Notice of California Privacy Rights**

  

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits customers of We Heart It who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us as described in **Section XIII**. 

  

At this time, we do not respond to Do Not Track browser settings or signals. For information about Do Not Track, please visit www.allaboutdnt.com. 

Some browsers and browser extensions support the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) (https://globalprivacycontrol.org/), which can send a signal to websites you visit that signals your intention to opt out of certain types of data processing. Where required by law, when we detect such a signal, we will make reasonable efforts to respect your choices indicated by a GPC setting.

  

Under California law, California residents have the right to request:

  

* the deletion or correction of the Personal Information we have about them
* additional information about whether and how we have collected, used, disclosed, and sold Personal Information about them
* the specific pieces of Personal Information we have about them

California residents also have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment if they exercise the rights list above. As noted above, we do not knowingly use or share sensitive categories of data about individual users (in California, “Sensitive Personal Information”) other than as needed to perform specific services you have requested.

**Submitting Privacy Rights Requests (Open to Eligible Residents of Some U.S. States)**

  

Some U.S. states (such as California, Colorado and Virginia) have privacy laws that grant residents the right to make requests regarding how their personal information is collected, use, and shared and to request access to certain information collected about them. We seek to comply with applicable law and to respect the wishes of our users. 

  

When you make a request, we may require that you provide information and follow procedures so that we can verify the request and your jurisdiction before responding to it. The verification steps we take may differ depending on the request you make and the requirements of state law. We will attempt to match the information that you provide in your request to information we already have on file to verify your identity. If we are able to verify your request, we will process it. If we cannot verify your request, we may ask you for additional information to help us verify your request.

  

Eligible users will be required to submit their first and last name and email address and may also be asked to provide other information so that we can verify the request. Please provide as much of the requested information as possible to help us verify the request. We will only use the information received in a request for the purposes of responding to the request.

  

Where permitted by law, eligible users may use an authorized agent to make privacy rights requests. We require the authorized agent to provide proof of the user’s written permission that shows the authorized agent has the authority to submit a request. An authorized agent must follow the process described below to make a request, and we will additionally require the authorized agent to verify his/her own identity.

1. **Security**

We Heart It is concerned with safeguarding your Personal Information.

We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored “personal data” (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email, mail, telephone, or conspicuous posting on our website in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.  We reserve the right to choose which method we use to contact you about such an event.

1. **International Transfer**
