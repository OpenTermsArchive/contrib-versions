**Who we are**

Save for CNN Live, the platform is operated or operated by Cable News Network, Inc. ("CNN, Inc."). CNN Live is provided to you by Turner Broadcasting System Europe Limited. ("Turner"). CNN, Inc. and Turner are referred to as "we", "us", "our", "CNN" in these Terms of Use.

You accept and agree to be bound by these Terms of Use when you use any part of the Platform, including when you view or access content or videos on any part of the Platform. If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, you should not access or use the Platform.

**1\. Eligibility to Subscribe:**

To be eligible to subscribe to the Subscription Services (each subscription shall be referred to as a "Subscription"), you must meet the following criteria (the "Eligibility Criteria"):

(A) for CNN Live, you must reside within the United Kingdom, ("UK"); and

(B) for all Subscription Services, you must be at least 18 years old, or older if the legal age of majority in your state or territory is older than 18.

Individuals under the age of 18, or the applicable age of majority, may access or use the Subscription Services only under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian with a Subscription for the relevant service (each authorized individual shall be referred to in these Terms as an "Authorized User").

**2\. Privacy**

Our [CNN Privacy Policy](http://www.cnn.com/privacy) explains how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use the Platforms. Please read these Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy carefully.

**3\. Changes**

(A) **Changes to these Terms of Use.**

(i) **Platform Terms:** CNN may modify these Terms of Use as they apply to your use of any paid or free part of the Platforms. CNN may add or remove terms at any time, and such changes will be effective immediately upon posting to the Platform. Your use of the Platform after such posting shall be deemed to constitute acceptance by you of such modifications, additions or deletions.

(ii) **CNN Live Terms:** CNN may also change these Terms of Use as they apply to CNN Live to: (1) reflect changes to your Subscription Service, including where we change the way we structure your Subscription Service or expand the scope of your Subscription Service by adding additional features, functionality or content; (2) to improve or re-structure the Terms, including to make them clearer or easier to understand; or (3) for legal, regulatory or security reasons, including to comply with mandatory changes in consumer protection laws.

(iii) If you have a Subscription to CNN Live and the Terms of Use change, you will have the opportunity to review the new terms before they take effect. If any change will disadvantage you, we will try to give you at least 30 days' notice in advance and explain how to let us know if you refuse to accept the new terms.

(1) If you refuse to accept the new terms, the latest version of the Terms of Use that you previously accepted will continue to apply to your use of CNN Live until the end of your Subscription period.

(2) If you do not tell us that you refuse to accept any such changes before they take place, we will take that as your acceptance of the changes.

(iv) The most up to date version of the Terms of Use will always be available on the Platform.

For further information on changes to any Subscription service, please see sub-paragraphs (B) and (C) below.

(B) **Changes to the Platform.** At various times, CNN may choose to make available updates, bug fixes, or other changes or enhancements to the Platform (collectively, "Service Updates").

(i) Service Updates may be: (1) automatic, such as in connection with general website changes and additional features or updates to data required by the Platform; (2) at your election, in which instance you will receive information and instructions for how to authorize optional Service Updates; or (3) mandatory, in which case you will be required to consent to the Service Update or install or upgrade a third-party plug-in if you wish to maintain access to the Platform. Please note that the Platform may be unavailable during a Service Update.

(ii) If you access the Platform through a mobile or connected device, such changes may also be communicated through updated versions of the Platform software, which you consent to receive without further notice.

(iii) If any change materially limits the availability of the Platform, then in addition to posting the revised document on the Platform, we'll also communicate such a limit directly to you via the email address associated with your CNN Account. Therefore, it is important that you keep your CNN Account information up to date. Your continued use of the Platform after the changes come into effect and, in the case of any Subscription, your failure to cancel the same before it renews or within any relevant notice period, will mean you agree to the changes. For more information on changes relating to CNN Live, see sub-paragraph (C) below.

(C) **Changes to CNN Live.** CNN may make minor changes to CNN Live from time to time to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements, implement technical adjustments and improvements (for example to address a security threat, improve your customer experience, or alter the design, branding and layout of CNN Live). If we make significant changes to CNN Live to your disadvantage, including the availability of your Subscription, CNN will notify you in advance and you may contact CNN to end your Subscription before the changes take effect and receive a refund for any Subscription Fees for services paid but not received.

(D) **Subscription Price Changes.** We may change the price of a Subscription. If you have signed up for a Subscription to CNN Live, we will give you at least 30 days' prior notice of price changes. If you do not want to continue your Subscription at the new price, you can cancel your Subscription before the start of the next subscription period. Your continuous use of your Subscription at the new price shall be taken as your consent to a price change.

**4\. Registration**

This includes pay-per-click services, web "robots" and any other current or future technologies. You also agree not to direct any third party to use these services, technologies or automated systems on your behalf.

• You agree not to use any technology, service or automated system to post more User Content than an individual could upload in a given period of time. You also agree not to direct any third party to use these services, technologies or automated systems on your behalf.

Any conduct that in CNN's sole discretion restricts or inhibits anyone else from using or enjoying The Platform will not be permitted. CNN reserves the right in its sole discretion to remove or edit User Content by you and to terminate Your Account for any reason.

There may also be risks of dealing with underage persons, people acting under false pretense, international trade issues and foreign nationals. By using Interactive Areas, you assume all associated risks.

**(C) Monitoring.**

(i) CNN shall have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor User Content posted or uploaded to The Platform to determine compliance with these Terms of Use and any operating rules established by CNN and to satisfy any law, regulation or authorized government request. Although CNN has no obligation to monitor, screen, edit or remove any of the User Content posted or uploaded to The Platform, CNN reserves the right, and has absolute discretion, to screen, edit, refuse to post or remove without notice any User Content posted or uploaded to The Platform at any time and for any reason, and you are solely responsible for creating backup copies of and replacing any User Content posted to The Platform at your sole cost and expense. In addition, CNN may share personally identifiable information in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or where we believe it is necessary, or as otherwise required or permitted by law. See [CNN Privacy Policy](http://www.cnn.com/privacy).

(ii) The decision by CNN to monitor and/or modify User Content does not constitute nor shall it be deemed to constitute any responsibility or liability in any manner on the part of CNN in connection with or arising from use by you of Interactive Areas on The Platform.

(D) License to User Content. By submitting User Content to The Platform, you automatically grant CNN the royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive right and license, but not the obligation, to use, publish, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, translate, create derivative works from, incorporate into other works, distribute, sub-license and otherwise exploit such User Content (in whole or in part) worldwide in any form, media or technology now known or hereafter developed for the full term of any copyright that may exist in such User Content, without payment to you or to any third parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event CNN licenses your User Content as stand-alone content outside of CNN's programming to third parties unaffiliated with CNN, CNN will pay you a percentage of the license fees it actually receives according to rates determined by CNN's licensing division, ImageSource. You represent and warrant to CNN that you have the full legal right, power and authority to grant to CNN the license provided for herein, that you own or control the complete exhibition and other rights to the User Content you submitted for the purposes contemplated in this license and that neither the User Content nor the exercise of the rights granted herein shall violate these Terms of Use, or infringe upon any rights, including the right of privacy or right of publicity, constitute a libel or slander against, or violate any common law or any other right of, or cause injury to, any person or entity. You further grant CNN the right, but not the obligation, to pursue at law any person or entity that violates your or CNN's rights in the User Content by a breach of these Terms of Use.

(E) Moral Rights. If it is determined that you retain moral rights (including rights of attribution or integrity) in the User Content, you hereby declare that (a) you do not require that any personally identifying information be used in connection with the User Content, or any derivative works of or upgrades or updates thereto; (b) you have no objection to the publication, use, modification, deletion and exploitation of the User Content by CNN or its licensees, successors and assigns; (c) you forever waive and agree not to claim or assert any entitlement to any and all moral rights of an author in any of the User Content; and (d) you forever release CNN, and its licensees, successors and assigns, from any claims that you could otherwise assert against CNN by virtue of any such moral rights. You also permit any other user to access, view, store or reproduce the User Content for that user's personal use.

(F) No Obligation. User Content submitted by you will be considered non-confidential and CNN is under no obligation to treat such User Content as proprietary information except pursuant to the [CNN Privacy Policy](http://www.cnn.com/privacy). Without limiting the foregoing, CNN reserves the right to use any User Content as it deems appropriate, including, without limitation, deleting, editing, modifying, rejecting, or refusing to post it. CNN is under no obligation to edit, delete or otherwise modify User Content once it has been submitted to CNN. CNN shall have no duty to attribute authorship of User Content to you, and shall not be obligated to enforce any form of attribution by third parties.

**8\. Copyright Ownership**

Content on the Platform (including the Subscription Services) is either owned by or licensed to CNN, and is subject to our (or our licensor's) copyright, trade mark rights, and other intellectual property rights.

(A) CNN is a distributor (and not a publisher or creator) of content supplied by third parties and users. Any opinions, advice, statements, services, offers, or other information or content expressed or made available by third parties, including information providers or users of the Platform, are those of the respective author(s) or distributor(s) and not of CNN. Neither CNN nor any third-party provider of information guarantees the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any content, nor its merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose.

CNN may, in its sole discretion, and at any time, with or without notice, suspend, disable or terminate your Subscription, and/or access to all or any part of the Platform at any time, with or without prior notice, if you infringe our (or any of our licensor's) intellectual property rights, if you seriously breach these Terms of Use, or if your Subscription or use of your Subscription is (in our view) likely to have a detrimental impact on any third party, without liability. If we disable your Subscription: (i) you agree that you will not create a subscription using another Account, or otherwise try to access the Platform without our permission; and (ii)the license granted to you herein shall automatically terminate and you must cease all use of the Platform.

You understand that some of the Content may be protected by security technology. You agree not to circumvent, disable, disassemble, alter, degrade, deactivate, or otherwise tamper with any of the security technology related to, or delivered with, such Content for any reason, or to attempt or assist another person to do so.

**11\. Payment & Billing**

(A) **Payment.** By creating an Account with CNN and providing us with your valid payment details, such as your debit card information ("Payment Method"), you agree to pay CNN the applicable subscription fee and any applicable taxes and service fees on a designated cycle, as described to you on sign-up (collectively, the "Subscription Fee").

**(B) Billing Cycle**

(i) For Subscriptions obtained through CNN, your billing will be processed by CNN or one of our authorized payment processors ("Payment Service"). Unless Section 13 ("Free Trials, Student Discount, and Promotional Offers") applies, the first Subscription Fee will be charged to your Payment Method on the date you receive confirmation of your purchase. Thereafter, the Subscription Fee will be billed on an ongoing, regular basis at the start of each new monthly or annual billing period (as applicable, depending on your Subscription) unless you cancel your Subscription in advance of renewal. Please note that billing cycles may vary. Note that the timing of your billing may change (i.e., in the event of a problem with your Payment Method, such as an expired credit card). You should confirm the applicable billing policies prior to establishing your Subscription. You can check your Subscription billing and payment details by \[insert details\].

(ii) If you access or purchase a Subscription through a third party (other than CNN) (a "Subscription Provider"), your billing will be processed by such Subscription Provider or its authorized vendor(s). Separate terms and conditions with that Subscription Provider will apply in addition to these Terms of Use. Please refer to Section 24 for information on Subscription Provider terms.

**(C) Unpaid Amounts.** CNN reserves the right to retry or permit the Payment Service to retry billing your Payment Method after failed attempts (e.g., if your Payment Method is rejected).

(i) We also reserve the right to pursue or permit the Payment Service or another third party to pursue any amounts you fail to pay in connection with your Subscription and suspend access to your Subscription until we (or the relevant third party) have obtained a valid payment method.

(ii) Except as specified in Annex 1 (Dispute Resolution), you will remain liable for all such amounts and all costs incurred in connection with the collection of these amounts, including, without limitation, bank overdraft fees, collection agency fees, reasonable attorneys' fees, and arbitration costs.

**(D) Updating Payment Method.** You may update your Payment Method with CNN at any time by contacting Customer Support who will be happy to assist. To change your Payment Method with a Subscription Provider, you will need to contact the Subscription Provider.

(i) If at any time CNN or your Subscription Provider is unable to charge your Payment Method for the Subscription Fee due to insufficient funds, expired or invalid account details, or otherwise, you remain responsible for the cost of such Subscription Fee.

(ii) A change in your Payment Method may result in changes to your prior billing cycle. It is your responsibility to update and maintain the Payment Method associated with your Subscription Fee. In the event your Payment Method is unable to cover the Subscription Fee, each of Subscription Provider and CNN reserve the right to suspend your access to the Platform, until such time as the Payment Method has been updated and the Subscription Fee is duly paid.

**12\. Cancellation of your Subscription**

(A) YOU MAY CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AT ANY TIME. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOU MUST CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE IT RENEWS IN ORDER TO AVOID BEING CHARGED THE SUBSCRIPTION FEE FOR THE NEXT BILLING CYCLE.

(B) If you cancel your Subscription, the cancellation will become effective at the end of the then-current Subscription period. In such a circumstance, you will continue to have access to your Subscription until the end of then-current Subscription period. If your Subscription is directly with CNN, you will need to cancel your Subscription through CNN by accessing your 'Settings' page in your Account or by contacting Customer Support, who can help you cancel your Subscription or answer any questions you have about cancellations.

(C) If you obtained your Subscription through a Subscription Provider, you will need to cancel your Subscription directly with such Subscription Provider.

(D) To the extent permissible by applicable law and without affecting your statutory rights, REFUNDS WILL NOT BE PROVIDED FOR ANY SUBSCRIPTION. WE DO NOT PROVIDE CREDIT, REFUNDS, OR PRORATED BILLING FOR SUBSCRIPTIONS THAT ARE CANCELLED. As explained above, in the event of cancellation, you will continue to have access to the Subscription Service until the end of the then-current Subscription period.

(E) If you purchased your Subscription through a Subscription Provider, that third party may offer refunds, discounts or other consideration in select circumstances. Please check the terms of your agreement with each Subscription Provider.

(F) Withdrawal rights for Subscriptions. If you are a resident in the UK, you have a legal right to a "cooling off" period, which allows the consumers to withdraw from your Subscription agreement within 14 days of purchase. However, when you purchased a Subscription from CNN, you also requested immediate access to the Subscription Content and confirmed that you will lose your statutory right to withdraw and receive a refund.

**13\. Free Trials, Student Discount, and Promotional Offers**

**(A) Free Trials.** A Subscription Service may be made available to you on a free trial basis for a limited time ("Trial Subscription"). The specific duration of the Trial Subscription will be specified in the applicable offer at sign-up. Trial Subscriptions are limited to new subscribers, unless otherwise specified. Your status as a new subscriber will be determined by CNN or the applicable Subscription Provider, in their sole discretion. These Terms apply to any Trial Subscription, unless otherwise specified.

(B) At the time of signing up for a Trial Subscription, you must provide a valid Payment Method in order to use the relevant Subscription Service during the Trial Subscription period. Your Payment Method will not be charged during the Trial Subscription period.

(C) UNLESS YOU CANCEL THE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE RENEWAL DATE, UPON THE EXPIRATION OF THE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION THE SUBSCRIPTION FEE FOR THE RELEVANT SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE WILL BE CHARGED TO YOUR PAYMENT METHOD.

(D) If we offer you a Trial Subscription or other promotion (e.g. a promotional price) for your Subscription, the specific terms of the promotion will be disclosed during your sign-up or in other materials describing the particular promotion. In the case of promotional pricing, after your promotion period ends, the Payment Service will begin billing your Payment Method for your Subscription at the regular Subscription Fee unless you duly cancel before the promotion period ends.

(E) You will not receive notice from CNN that your Trial Subscription is about to end unless required by applicable law.

(F) To find additional details about your Trial Subscription, including the date the Trial Subscription ends, please visit the "Billing Information" screen in your "Settings" tab on the Platform for the latest information contained in our records, or, if you have subscribed through a Subscription Provider, contact your Subscription Provider directly.

(G) Promotional Offers. No refunds, adjustments or price protection will be applied to your Subscription Fee in the event of a new/subsequent discount or promotional offering after you sign-up for the Platform. New customers may take advantage of any "new customer" promotion only once. Requirements for a special promotion will be stated at the time each offer is presented.

(H) You agree not to register multiple times for the same promotional offer using multiple names, addresses, email addresses or other means. Any such action shall constitute a violation of these Terms and may result in the termination of your Account.

(A) THE PLATFORM CONTAINS CONTENT THAT MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR ALL AGES OR VIEWERS.

(B) MOST ENTERTAINMENT CONTENT IS RATED ACCORDING TO GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED BY THE MOTION PICTURE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA, TELEVISION PARENTAL GUIDELINES OR THE BRITISH BOARD OF FILM CLASSIFICATION IN THE UK (AS APPLICABLE).

(A) You may not copy, reproduce, distribute, transfer, sell, license, publish, enter into a database, display, perform publicly, modify, create derivative works, upload, edit, post, link to, frame, transmit, rent, lease, lend or sublicense or in any way exploit any part of the Platform, or attempt to interfere with the operation of the Platform in any way, except that you may access and display material and all other Content displayed on the Platform for non-commercial, personal, entertainment use for a limited time only as strictly authorized herein.

The Content on the Subscription Services will vary from time to time and CNN does not make any promises with respect to the availability or accessibility of any particular items of Content at any time.

(B) Please note that some Content may specify an access window in which you will be able to view the Content. The access window will typically range between four (4) to eight (8) weeks, although because these windows may vary, you should pay close attention to the description provided with the Content. During the applicable access window, you will be able to view the Content as many times as you want, BUT ONCE THE ACCESS WINDOW FOR A PARTICULAR CONTENT ITEM TERMINATES, YOU WILL NO LONGER HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACCESS THAT PIECE OF CONTENT. It is your responsibility to monitor the access window for each piece of Content available via the Platform, and CNN and its partners and affiliates accept no liability for any access windows or the expiration thereof.

(E) You should be sure to read the detailed description of each piece of Content to determine options for viewing or accessing that Content. While we do our best to keep the Content descriptions up-to-date, CNN does not warrant that such descriptions will always be complete, current, or accurate.

(F) No transfer of ownership to any portion of the Content shall be made as a result of any access you are granted to the Platform as a result of your Subscription or Account.

(G) CNN uses various technologies to provide you with an optimal viewing experience. That said, quality of Content, including resolution, may be affected by the format of the Content, your location, the speed and bandwidth of your internet service, and the devices used, among other factors. HD, Ultra HD and 4K Ultra HD availability, if and as applicable, for certain Content depends on your internet service and device capabilities. Not all Content is available in all formats. The time it takes you to begin playing Content will vary based on a number of factors, including your location, internet bandwidth, the number of devices simultaneously connecting to the same network, the Content you have selected, and the configuration of the device you are using. As a result, CNN is unable to make any promises about the Content in these respects.

**Annex 1: Dispute Resolution.**

**The provisions of this Annex 1 shall only apply to you if you are based in the Service Area.**

Summary:

Our customer-service department can resolve most customer concerns quickly and to the customer's satisfaction. Please contact CNN at [cnn.com/feedback**.**](https://www.cnn.com/feedback) **In the unlikely event that you're not satisfied with customer service's solution (or if CNN has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.**

Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Unless expressly limited by this Dispute Resolution provision, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. **Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.** For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $75,000, we will pay all costs of the arbitration. Moreover, in arbitration you are entitled to recover attorneys' fees from us to at least the same extent as you would be in court.

In addition, under certain circumstances (as explained below), we will pay you more than the amount of the arbitrator's award and will pay your attorney (if any) twice his or her reasonable attorneys' fees if the arbitrator awards you an amount that is greater than what we have offered you to settle the dispute.

**Arbitration Agreement**

**(1) Claims Subject to Arbitration:** CNN and you agree to arbitrate **all disputes and claims** between us, except for claims arising from bodily injury or that pertain to enforcing, protecting, or the validity of your or our intellectual property rights (or the intellectual property rights of any of our licensors, affiliates and partners). This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:

• claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other statutory or common-law legal theory;

• claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);

• claims for mental or emotional distress or injury not arising out of physical bodily injury;

• claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and

• claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.

References to "CNN," "you," and "us" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, licensees, licensors, and providers of content as of the time your or our claim arises; our respective predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns (including AT&T and its affiliates); and all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of Services under this or prior Agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an action in small claims court seeking only individualized relief, so long as the action remains in that court and is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction. This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. **You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.** This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.

**(2) Pre-Arbitration Notice of Disputes:** A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice to CNN should be sent by certified mail to: General Counsel, WarnerMedia News & Sports, 1 CNN Center, Atlanta, GA 30303 ("Notice Address"). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand").

If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by us or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or us is entitled. You may download a form to initiate arbitration at: adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer\_Demand\_for\_Arbitration\_Form\_1.pdf.

**(3) Arbitration Procedure:** The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules ("AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this arbitration provision, and will be administered by the AAA. (If the AAA is unavailable, another arbitration provider shall be selected by the parties or by the court.) The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by requesting them in writing at the Notice Address. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision or whether a dispute can or must be brought in arbitration are for the court to decide. The arbitrator may consider but shall not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations involving different customers. Unless we and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. Except as provided in subsection (6) below, the arbitrator can award the same damages and individualized relief that a court can award under applicable law.

**(4) Arbitration Fees:** After we receive notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, we will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $75,000 in value. (The filing fee currently is $200 but is subject to change by the arbitration provider. If you are unable to pay this fee, we will pay it directly upon receiving a written request at the Notice Address.) We will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies we previously paid that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek relief valued at greater than $75,000 (either to you or to us), the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.

**(5) Alternative Payment and Attorney Premium:** If you initiated arbitration in accordance with the notice requirements above in subsection (2) and the arbitrator issues an award in your favor that is greater than the value of our last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, then we will:

• pay you the amount of the award or $10,000 ("the alternative payment"), whichever is greater; and

• pay your attorney, if any, twice the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration ("the attorney premium").

If we did not make a written offer to settle the dispute before an arbitrator was selected, you and your attorney will be entitled to receive the alternative payment and the attorney premium, respectively, if the arbitrator awards you any relief on the merits. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits. In assessing whether an award that includes attorneys' fees or expenses is greater than the value of our last written settlement offer, the calculation shall include only the portion of the award representing attorneys' fees or expenses that you reasonably incurred pursuing the arbitration through the date of our settlement offer.

The right to the attorney premium supplements any right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law. Thus, if you would be entitled to a larger amount under the applicable law, this provision does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding you that amount. However, you may not recover both the attorney premium and a duplicative award of attorneys' fees or costs. Although under some laws we may have a right to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses if we prevail in an arbitration, we agree that we will not seek such an award.

**(6) Requirement of Individual Arbitration**: The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. **YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING.** Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, class, or private attorney general proceeding. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, any of these prohibitions on non-individualized declaratory or injunctive relief; class, representative, and private attorney general claims; and consolidation are found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or with respect to a particular request for relief (such as a request for injunctive relief sought with respect to a particular claim), then that claim or request for relief shall be severed , and all other claims and requests for relief shall be arbitrated.

**(7) Future Changes to Arbitration Provision:** Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if we make any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the arbitration Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.
