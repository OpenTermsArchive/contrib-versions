A WarnerMedia Company 
======================

Updated: 4/8/2022

  

This Privacy Policy explains what personal information WarnerMedia companies ("we", "us", or "our") collect, use, share and otherwise process about individuals (“you”) interacting with our Offerings (“**Information**”). Also, this Privacy Policy does not apply to Digital Services that are online services targeted at children. You can learn more about affiliated companies by visiting our [controller and affiliate site](https://www.warnermediaprivacy.com/policycenter/b2c/affiliateslist/) ([https://www.warnermediaprivacy.com/policycenter/b2c/affiliateslist/](https://www.warnermediaprivacy.com/policycenter/b2c/affiliateslist/)).

  

Our family of companies is made up of a number of different legal entities and business units. In this Privacy Policy, the Controller or Controllers (“**Controller**”) of your Information means the company that decides the purposes for which it is processed and how it is processed. Which company is the Controller in relation to the processing of your Information will depend on which Offering you are using; it will often be the company responsible for providing that Offering, as may be set out in our terms and conditions.

  

In some circumstances, more than one Controller may be responsible for processing your Information, for example, where Information is shared with other companies for a purpose set out in this Privacy Policy. Please navigate to our [Controller List](https://www.warnermediaprivacy.com/policycenter/b2c/controllerslist) for more details. If you still have questions about the relevant Controller, please contact us using one of the methods set out below.

  

Under the laws of some countries outside the European Economic Area, we may need your consent to our processing of your Information set forth in this Privacy Policy. Subject to any indications you may give us to the contrary, such as opting out or not opting in if asked, and where permitted by law, by providing Information or otherwise interacting with our Offerings, you consent to our use of Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

SCOPE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY
----------------------------

Please read this policy carefully. It explains the types of Information we may collect about you, the purposes for and methods by which we collect it, and (where applicable) the lawful basis on which we do so, as well as information about data retention, your rights and how to contact us. This Privacy Policy covers both our online and offline data processing activities, including Information that we collect through our various Offerings such as those set out below: 

  

**Digital Services:**

*   Our websites, including activities run through our websites, such as surveys, research studies, focus group tests, promotions, competitions and prize-draws, purchases within our services, calls to action for user-generated content (“UGC”) and subscribing for newsletters;
*   Mobile apps, including activities run through our apps, such as those listed for our websites;
*   Subscription services or other streaming services offered by us to consumers and services where you receive our audio-visual content through our websites, mobile apps and/or via a service provided by a third party, such as an internet service provider, pay TV platform or mobile phone operator;
*   Console games;
*   Our fan pages/channels/accounts on third party social networks (e.g. official pages on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter).

  

**Offline Services:**

*   Studio tours;

*   Events you attend as a consumer or guest (as opposed to in a business capacity) such as film premieres, marketing and influencer events, focus group or user tests and private events held at our premises or studios under hire.

  

Please note that we may combine Information that we collect via one source (e.g. a website) with Information we collect via another source (e.g. a mobile app), including with Information possibly collected by a one of our companies or a third party (as further described below). Please also note our Offline Services may involve you interacting with our Digital Services and vice-versa, for example, where you book a studio tour or your participation to a marketing event through a one of our websites. Certain Offerings (for example, some branded theme parks, online stores, and in-app purchases) are not operated by us but by a third party licensee or the app store; any processing of your personal information by such a licensee or app store is not subject to this Privacy Policy, so please check carefully whether the relevant terms and conditions refer to additional companies.

The Social Media Site will record that you have done this, and this Information may be linked to targeting/advertising activities, including building custom audiences. 

**Advertising cookies or similar technologies**: Some of our Digital Services may use a third-party advertising network, or an affiliated company, to deliver targeted advertising. They may also have the capability to limit the number of times you see an advertisement and track your browsing or usage across our Digital Services and Social Media Sites.  

**Managing cookies and other technologies.** For Digital Services in some jurisdictions, including the EEA, you may learn more information about our use of cookies and other technologies, and provide or withdraw consents, or set your cookie preferences and in some cases object legitimate interest purposes for processing your personal information, by clicking Manage Cookies+ or otherwise adjusting cookie preferences. These settings are accessible on a site or app specific basis, at any time through the ‘Manage Cookies+’ link or a similar link located on webpages or in application settings. You may also use your app/browser settings to set your cookie preferences. 

  

For many Digital Services in the EEA, we participate in the IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework, which is described in more detail by navigating to the [IAB’s website](https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/), and complies with its specifications and policies on applicable websites and apps. OneTrust operates the consent management platform with the identification number 28.

If you would like to update these preferences, you can (i) log in to an account you may have created with us to adjust your settings (where the feature is available) or (ii) otherwise submit a request by navigating to our [Individual Rights Request Portal](https://www.warnermediaprivacy.com/policycenter/Individualrights/). You can also follow the ’unsubscribe’ instructions provided in any marketing email you receive.

  

**Ad choices.** On our own or working with affiliates or third parties, we may present advertisements and engage in data collection, reporting, ad response measurement, and site analytics on our Digital Services and on third party websites across the Internet and applications over time. We, our affiliates, or third parties may use cookies, web beacons, pixels, SDKs, or similar technologies to perform this activity. They obtain information about applications you use, websites you visit, and other information from across your devices and browsers and across websites, services, and apps over time, in order to help serve advertising that will be more relevant to your interests on and off our Digital Services and across your devices and browsers. This type of advertising is known as ‘interest-based advertising’. We, our affiliates, or third parties may also use this information to associate your different browsers and devices together for interest-based advertising and for other purposes like research, analytics, internal operations, fraud prevention, and enhancing consumer experiences.

  

In addition to managing your preferences through our consent management platform, for more information about interest-based advertising on your desktop or mobile browser, and to opt out of this type of advertising by third parties that participate in self-regulatory programs by visiting the [Your Online Choices website](https://www.youronlinechoices.com/) if in the EEA, which is hosted by and can be visited at the [European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance](https://www.edaa.eu/) (EDAA) website; if in Argentina to the [Alianza de Publicidad Digital de Argentina](http://tupublicidaddigital.org/) (APDA); if in Canada, by visiting the [Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada](https://youradchoices.ca/) (DAAC) website and if in the United States, by navigating to the [Digital Advertising Alliance of the US](https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/) (DAA) website. To learn more about interest-based advertising on mobile apps and to opt out of this type of advertising by third parties that participate in the DAA’s AppChoices tool, please visit the [Ad choice link](https://youradchoices.com/control) to download the version of AppChoices for your device. Please note that any opt-out choice you exercise through these programs will apply to interest-based advertising by the third parties you select but will still allow the collection of Information for other purposes, including research, analytics, and internal operations. You can therefore continue to receive advertising, but that advertising may be less relevant to your interests.

  

Important things to note about cookie-based web browser opt outs (such as those utilized by the EDAA, APDA and DAAC):

*   **Blocked cookies:** The opt out cookie may not work if your browser is configured to block third-party cookies.
*   **Deleting or protecting opt outs:** If you delete your cookies, you will need to opt out again. There are browser plugins to help you preserve your opt out cookies.
*   **Only this browser:** The opt out only applies to the browser profile in which you set it. For example, if you set the opt out while using Firefox, but then use Chrome, the opt out will not be active in Chrome. To opt out in Chrome, you will need to repeat the opt out process. This is because the cookies cannot be read between different browsers or browser profiles.

  

**The opt out does not block or delete cookies:** It also does not prevent the use of cookies or other technologies for purposes other than selecting ads based on your interests as inferred by your online behavior. If you opt out, data may still be collected about your web browsing activities and you will still see advertising. Ads may be selected, for example, based on the content of the web page in which they are shown. If you wish to block or delete cookies altogether, you can use web browser settings to do so.

  

You may have more options depending on your mobile device and operating system. For example, most device operating systems (e.g., iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices) provide their own instructions on how to limit or prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems to learn more about these features and how they apply to tailored in-app advertisements.

You may also limit the collection of precise location information from websites through browser settings.

INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER
----------------------

We operate internationally, and some of the processes involved in our use of your Information will require your Information to be stored or processed in countries outside the country where you are located, including countries where the level of legal protection for your Information may be different and where you may have fewer legal rights in relation to it. In particular, your Information may be transferred to, and processed in the United States, where some of our systems are located.

  

Please see our [Affiliates Table](https://www.warnermediaprivacy.com/policycenter/b2c/affiliateslist) for examples of the countries where your Information may be transferred.

  

However, whenever we transfer your Information outside of a country or region, such as the European Economic Area, we will make sure that we take steps necessary to comply with applicable legal requirements. Therefore, where required, we will ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place by using appropriate contractual mechanisms, such as the EU Standard Contractual Clauses, or by relying upon the service providers participating in an approved international data transfer mechanism, including the adoption of Binding Corporate Rules. For further information about the documents we use to protect your Information when it is transferred outside of your country or region, please submit a request through our [Individual Rights Request Portal.](https://www.warnermediaprivacy.com/policycenter/Individualrights/)
