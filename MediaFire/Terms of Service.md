Account Safeguards
------------------

To access or benefit from the Services or features on MediaFire, you may have to create a MediaFire account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your access information and are responsible for all activities that occur utilizing your information. You should only access your MediaFire account from a trusted network. MediaFire is not liable for any losses you might suffer due to unauthorized access to your account. However, you may be held liable for losses incurred by MediaFire or others due to your failure to maintain the confidentiality of your access information.

MediaFire & Services
--------------------

MediaFire does not endorse any Content, including, but not limited to, its accuracy, completeness, appropriateness or legality, stored on or distributed through the Services and MediaFire expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with Content. Content is yours, not ours.

MediaFire Content may contain links to external sites; however, MediaFire is not responsible for any availability of or the content on or through any external site.

MediaFire is not a backup service and does not operate like one. While we work hard to store your data safely and securely, you should keep your data safely stored in more than one location or service and not singularly on MediaFire. MediaFire bears no responsibility for maintaining your data indefinitely. You bear full responsibility and sole liability for any corrupted, lost or irrecoverable data. You understand and agree that MediaFire reserves the right to delete, move, archive (including account information) or edit any Content that it may determine violates the Agreement and/or Privacy Policy or is otherwise unacceptable and may terminate your access to the Services, without prior notice and at its sole discretion.

When MediaFire removes or disables Content for policy violations, the user who posted the Content may receive a strike. The user is notified of the violation. Repeated policy violations may result in account termination. MediaFire reserves the right to determine what is harmful to its users, operations, or reputation including any activities that restrict or inhibit any other user from using and enjoying the Services. Complaints about violators of our policies should be submitted to our abuse department. Each complaint will be investigated and appropriate action will be taken.

MediaFire premium accounts file transactions below a minimum of 100KB will be registered as 100KB transactions. Additionally, premium accounts are limited to initiating no more than 1 million (1,000,000) transfers per month. Non-premium accounts have no transfer limits. MediaFire may limit the size of a file.

MediaFire reserves the right to terminate your access to any and/or all parts of the Services at any time for any reason without prior notice or liability. The terms of the Agreement and Privacy Policy shall survive any termination of your access to the Services.

MediaFire may change, suspend or discontinue all or any aspect of the Services at any time, including the availability of any feature, database, or Content, without prior notice or liability.

_Which means: You are solely responsible for your Content. Important data should be stored in more than one place. When receiving Content from a 3rd party, always exercise caution._

Software, Applications, Modifications & License
-----------------------------------------------

MediaFire Services may include special applications, application programming interfaces, installable software, or developer resources you can download and install on your desktop, mobile phone or other devices with Internet capability to enhance your ability to interact and benefit from the Services (“Software”). This Software may require periodic modifications/updates, which may occur automatically or require you to initiate them. The Software is a copyrighted work of MediaFire and is governed by the terms of this Agreement. MediaFire grants you a “Limited License” to use the Software solely to interact with the Services.

When you download and/or use the Software, you accept this Limited License. MediaFire grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-transferable, worldwide, royalty-free limited license to use the Software on any device you own or control. This Limited License is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by MediaFire, in the manner permitted by this Agreement. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, trade, redistribute, assign or sublicense your rights to use the Software, grant a security interest in or over your rights to use the Software, or otherwise transfer any part of your rights to use the Software. You may not, or permit anyone else to, copy (except as expressly permitted by this license), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Software, any updates, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open sourced components included with the Software). Any attempt to do so is a violation of the rights of MediaFire and its licensors. If you breach this restriction, you may be subject to prosecution and damages. The terms of the Limited License will govern any upgrades provided by MediaFire that replace and/or supplement the original Software, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license, in which case the terms of that license will govern.

Nothing in this Agreement grants you any right, title, or interest in the Services, Software or Content (other than your own) or to use any MediaFire trademark, logo, domain name (or any derivative thereof), branding or features.

_Which means: MediaFire will offer you the ability to download and use new applications from time to time and may update the software periodically. MediaFire owns all its software and applications, regardless of who provided input or may make modifications to it, and only you may use it under this licensing agreement._

DMCA: Digital Millennium Copyright Act
--------------------------------------

_Which means: Go to the Copyright page for legal guidelines, contact us, and we’ll respond ASAP._

MediaFire Trial & Premium Accounts - Payment, Renewal and Cancellation
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Terms of Payment are an integral, material part of these Terms of Service, and are incorporated into these Terms of Service by reference. [Visit our Terms of Payment for more information](https://www.mediafire.com/policies/terms_of_payment.php)

Bandwidth
---------

Business services offer "Rollover Bandwidth". Unused bandwidth in each billing period will become available in subsequent billing periods, without time limitations for usage. If you upgrade your plan, you will be billed immediately for the new plan and any unused bandwidth from your previous plan will be rolled over into your new plan. Additional increments of bandwidth may be purchased for immediate use, which qualifies as Rollover Bandwidth. This one time purchase is not a recurring charge and will not affect the pricing of your Subscription service. You may view your billing history from your My Account page.

Pro services will be allocated 1TB of total storage, and a minimum of 1TB of bandwidth every 30 days, based on your initial subscription date. Additional increments of bandwidth may be purchased. If you have less than 1TB available at the beginning of the next 30 day period, your bandwidth will be automatically increased to 1TB. If your account is in excess of 1TB, bandwidth will not be added or deducted.

Bandwidth in a premium account is consumed by anyone, including you, who download your file(s). From your My Account page, you may view stats about your bandwidth usage.

Processing
----------

MediaFire reserves the right to fix any processing errors it discovers, which may result in adjustments to your account.

GDPR
----

MediaFire will process personal data in accordance with the GDPR. You have the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict, and object to the processing of your personal data. For more information on your rights and how to exercise them, please refer to our GDPR Policy.

As-Is Services
--------------

YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES SHALL BE AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, MEDIAFIRE DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

NEITHER MEDIAFIRE NOR ANY PROVIDER OF ANY THIRD PARTY CONTENT WARRANTS THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE OR MAKES ANY WARRANTY OF THE RESULTS TO BE OBTAINED FROM USE OF THE SERVICES OR CONTENT. BOTH THE SERVICES AND CONTENT ARE DISTRIBUTED ON AN "AS IS, AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. NEITHER MEDIAFIRE NOR ANY THIRD PARTY MAKES ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES OR CONTENT OR ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES SOLD THROUGH THE SERVICES.

NEITHER MEDIAFIRE NOR ANY THIRD PARTY WARRANT THAT ANY FILES AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOADING THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL BE FREE OF VIRUSES OR SIMILAR CONTAMINATION OR DESTRUCTIVE FEATURES. YOU AGREE THAT YOU ASSUME ALL RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES AND THE ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS OF THE CONTENT. MEDIAFIRE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR CONTENT OR FOR ANY VIOLATION OF ITS AGREEMENT.

FOR CLARITY, MEDIAFIRE ASSUMES NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY (I) ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR INACCURACIES OF CONTENT, (II) PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE, OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER, RESULTING FROM YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF OUR SERVICES, (III) ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF OUR SECURE SERVERS AND/OR ANY AND ALL PERSONAL INFORMATION AND/OR FINANCIAL INFORMATION STORED THEREIN, (IV) ANY INTERRUPTION OR CESSATION OF TRANSMISSION TO OR FROM OUR SERVICES, (V) ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJANS, OR THE LIKE WHICH MAY BE TRANSMITTED TO OR THROUGH OUR SERVICES BY ANY THIRD PARTY, AND/OR (VI) ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN ANY CONTENT OR FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF ANY CONTENT POSTED, EMAILED, TRANSMITTED, OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE VIA THE SERVICES. MEDIAFIRE DOES NOT WARRANT, ENDORSE, GUARANTEE, OR ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE ADVERTISED OR OFFERED BY A THIRD PARTY THROUGH THE SERVICES OR ANY HYPERLINKED SERVICES OR FEATURED IN ANY BANNER OR OTHER ADVERTISING, AND MEDIAFIRE WILL NOT BE A PARTY TO OR IN ANY WAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING ANY TRANSACTION BETWEEN YOU AND THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. AS WITH THE PURCHASE OF A PRODUCT OR SERVICE THROUGH ANY MEDIUM OR IN ANY ENVIRONMENT, YOU SHOULD USE YOUR BEST JUDGMENT AND EXERCISE CAUTION.

_Which means: Standard contract capitalized language. Internet services are great but nothing is perfect and we’re not responsible if something goes wrong._

Limitation of Liability
-----------------------

NEITHER MEDIAFIRE NOR ANY THIRD PARTY PROVIDER SHALL BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL MEDIAFIRE'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF THE SERVICES EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU TO MEDIAFIRE IN THE TWELVE MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM. THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN MEDIAFIRE AND YOU. IN STATES, COUNTRIES OR TERRITORIES NOT ALLOWING EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, MEDIAFIRE AND ANY THIRD PARTY PROVIDER SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT OF THE LAW.

The Services are controlled and offered by MediaFire from its facilities in the United States of America. MediaFire makes no representations that the Services are appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Services from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are responsible for compliance with local law.

_Which means: Also standard contract capitalized language. This clarifies that we limit our responsibility if something goes wrong._

Indemnity
---------

You agree to indemnify, defend and hold MediaFire and its affiliates, and both MediaFire and their respective officers, directors, owners, employees, agents, information providers and licensors harmless from and against any and all claims, liability, losses, damages, obligations, costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by any MediaFire Party in connection with any Content or use of the Services, whether via your password and/or by any other person, whether or not authorized by you. MediaFire reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, and in such case, you agree to cooperate with MediaFire's defense of such claim. This defense and indemnification obligation will survive these Terms of Service and your use of the Services.

_Which means: If we get in trouble because of something you did or should have done, you’ll defend us in court or help us defend ourselves._

Miscellaneous Legal
-------------------

The Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by MediaFire without restriction.

The Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, without reference to principles of choice of law. You and MediaFire each consent to the jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in Montgomery County, Texas ('Courts') with respect to any action, suit, or proceeding arising out of or related to the Agreement or to the Services and/or Content. You agree not to bring any such action, suit, or proceeding in any court other than the Courts, unless required by applicable law.

These Terms of Service, together with the Privacy Policy and any other legal notices published by MediaFire on the Services, the Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all previous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter. If any inconsistency exists between the terms of the Agreement and any additional terms and conditions posted on the Services, such terms shall be interpreted as to eliminate any inconsistency, if possible, and otherwise, the additional terms and conditions shall control. If any provision of the Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, (i) such provision shall be interpreted in such a manner as to preserve, to the maximum extent possible, the intent of the parties, (ii) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and (iii) such decision shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision under other circumstances.

No failure in delay in exercising or enforcing this policy shall constitute a waiver of the Agreement or any other right or remedy. If any provision of the Agreement is deemed unenforceable due to law or change in law, such a provision shall be disregarded and the balance of the Agreement shall remain in effect.

YOU AND MEDIAFIRE AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICES MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ARISES, OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.

_Which means: Standard contract language. All disagreements will be heard in Harris County, Texas, USA within one year._

Please submit reports of any violations to our support department.
