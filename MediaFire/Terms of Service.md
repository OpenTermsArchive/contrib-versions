Account Safeguards
------------------

To access or benefit from the Services or features on MediaFire, you may have to create a MediaFire account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your access information and are responsible for all activities that occur utilizing your information. You should only access your MediaFire account from a trusted network. Although MediaFire will not be liable for any losses you might suffer, you may be liable for the losses of MediaFire or others.

MediaFire & Services
--------------------

MediaFire does not endorse any Content, including, but not limited to, its accuracy, completeness, appropriateness or legality, stored on or distributed through the Services and MediaFire expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with Content. Content is yours, not ours.

MediaFire Content may contain links to external sites; however, MediaFire is not responsible for any availability of or the content on or through any external site.

MediaFire is not a backup service and does not operate like one. While we work hard to store your data safely and securely, you should keep your data safely stored in more than one location or service and not singularly on MediaFire. MediaFire bears no responsibility for maintaining your data indefinitely. You bear full responsibility and sole liability for any corrupted, lost or irrecoverable data. You understand and agree that MediaFire reserves the right to delete, move, archive (including account information) or edit any Content that it may determine violates the Agreement and/or Privacy Policy or is otherwise unacceptable and may terminate your access to the Services, without prior notice and at its sole discretion.

When MediaFire removes or disables Content for policy violations, the user who posted the Content may receive a strike. The user is notified of the violation. Repeated policy violations may result in account termination. MediaFire reserves the right to determine what is harmful to its users, operations, or reputation including any activities that restrict or inhibit any other user from using and enjoying the Services. Complaints about violators of our policies should be submitted to our abuse department. Each complaint will be investigated and appropriate action will be taken.

MediaFire premium accounts file transactions below a minimum of 100KB will be registered as 100KB transactions. Additionally, premium accounts are limited to initiating no more than 1 million (1,000,000) transfers per month. Non-premium accounts have no transfer limits. MediaFire may limit the size of a file.

MediaFire reserves the right to terminate your access to any and/or all parts of the Services at any time for any reason without prior notice or liability. The terms of the Agreement and Privacy Policy shall survive any termination of your access to the Services.

MediaFire may change, suspend or discontinue all or any aspect of the Services at any time, including the availability of any feature, database, or Content, without prior notice or liability.

_Which means: You are solely responsible for your Content. Important data should be stored in more than one place. When receiving Content from a 3rd party, always exercise caution._

Software, Applications, Modifications & License
-----------------------------------------------

MediaFire Services may include special applications, application programming interfaces, installable software, or developer resources you can download and install on your desktop, mobile phone or other devices with Internet capability to enhance your ability to interact and benefit from the Services (“Software”). This Software may require periodic modifications/updates, which may occur automatically or require you to initiate them. The Software is a copyrighted work of MediaFire and is governed by the terms of this Agreement. MediaFire grants you a “Limited License” to use the Software solely to interact with the Services.

When you download and/or use the Software, you accept this Limited License. MediaFire grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-transferable, worldwide, royalty-free limited license to use the Software on any device you own or control. This Limited License is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by MediaFire, in the manner permitted by this Agreement. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, trade, redistribute, assign or sublicense your rights to use the Software, grant a security interest in or over your rights to use the Software, or otherwise transfer any part of your rights to use the Software. You may not, or permit anyone else to, copy (except as expressly permitted by this license), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Software, any updates, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open sourced components included with the Software). Any attempt to do so is a violation of the rights of MediaFire and its licensors. If you breach this restriction, you may be subject to prosecution and damages. The terms of the Limited License will govern any upgrades provided by MediaFire that replace and/or supplement the original Software, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license, in which case the terms of that license will govern.

Nothing in this Agreement grants you any right, title, or interest in the Services, Software or Content (other than your own) or to use any MediaFire trademark, logo, domain name (or any derivative thereof), branding or features.

_Which means: MediaFire will offer you the ability to download and use new applications from time to time and may update the software periodically. MediaFire owns all its software and applications, regardless of who provided input or may make modifications to it, and only you may use it under this licensing agreement._

DMCA: Digital Millennium Copyright Act

If your copyrighted or trademarked works are being distributed through the Services without your permission, please see our Copyright page for information on how to make a claim. Claims will be processed in accordance with United States law.

MediaFire Trial & Premium Accounts - Payment, Renewal and Cancellation
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Terms of Payment are an integral, material part of these Terms of Service, and are incorporated into these Terms of Service by reference. [Visit our Terms of Payment for more information](https://www.mediafire.com/policies/terms_of_payment.php)

Bandwidth
---------

Business services offer "Rollover Bandwidth". Unused bandwidth in each billing period will become available in subsequent billing periods, without time limitations for usage. If you upgrade your plan, you will be billed immediately for the new plan and any unused bandwidth from your previous plan will be rolled over into your new plan. Additional increments of bandwidth may be purchased for immediate use, which qualifies as Rollover Bandwidth. This one time purchase is not a recurring charge and will not affect the pricing of your Subscription service. You may view your billing history from your My Account page.

Pro services will be allocated 1TB of total storage, and a minimum of 1TB of bandwidth every 30 days, based on your initial subscription date. Additional increments of bandwidth may be purchased. If you have less than 1TB available at the beginning of the next 30 day period, your bandwidth will be automatically increased to 1TB. If your account is in excess of 1TB, bandwidth will not be added or deducted.

Bandwidth in a premium account is consumed by anyone, including you, who download your file(s). From your My Account page, you may view stats about your bandwidth usage.

Processing
----------

MediaFire reserves the right to fix any processing errors it discovers, which may result in adjustments to your account.
