**MediaFire’s Privacy Policy and User Notice**
==============================================

Introduction
------------

We do our best to comply with the rapidly changing privacy policies globally. If we are missing something, let us know at [rivacypay@ediafiremay.omcay](ailtomay:rivacypay@ediafiremay.omcay).

MediaFire recognizes and believes that data privacy is essential to all Internet users, and the privacy of your personal information is of the utmost importance to us. We are committed to providing you an experience that is safe, secure, and trustworthy. Part of this commitment means safeguarding and respecting your privacy and your choices.

This Privacy Notice explains what information we collect, how we use it and what choices you have about it, in addition to information on disclosure, retention, and protection of your personal information.

Because we’re a technology company, some of the concepts below are a little technical, but we’ve tried our best to explain things in a simple and clear way. This Privacy Policy gives you an overview of all possible situations in which we could interact together. Of course, all situations may not apply to you.

This Privacy Policy, in conjunction with our Terms of Service, collectively referred to as the "Agreement", governs your use of the MediaFire website, Content, apps, software, products, applications, tools and services provided to you on, from, or through the MediaFire website or platform regardless of how your access or use them (collectively, the "Services"). Where we provide the Services under contract with an organization (for example your employer) that organization controls the information processed by the Services. “User”, “You” and “Your” refers to you, the person accessing this website and accepting MediaFire’s Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions. “We”, “Us”, and “Ourselves” refers to MediaFire. “Party”, “Parties”, or “Us”, refers to both you and ourselves. It doesn’t matter if the words are capitalized or not. If you choose not to accept this Policy, please do not access or use our Services or interact with any other aspect of our business.

All topics are covered in greater detail below.

Overview
--------

We want you to fully understand how we may collect, use, and share data relating to you, our legal basis, your rights and the choices that are available to you.

This Privacy Policy incorporates:
---------------------------------

* Better navigation and user-friendly language. To make the policy easier to understand, we use clear, plain language and examples that illustrate our activities.
* Insights into how we acquire your information and how it is used.
* More control over your information. We provide intelligence on how you can control the information you provide to us. Our policy explains how you can make choices about your information, and the measures we’ve put in place to keep your information secure.
* More about using our products for work. Many users have access to our services through their organizations (e.g., their employers), who control their accounts or use of our Services. The updated policy clarifies our relationship to these users and explains the tools available to administrators of these users.

What is Personal and Non Personal Information?
----------------------------------------------

Personally Identifiable Information, commonly referred to as PII, is information that itself may identify a unique individual or can be linked back to an individual, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an online or device identifier, an identification number, or location data such as your IP address. In relation to your interaction with MediaFire, personal information, for example, may include information you may purposefully provide such as your name and email address during account registration or your address and financial information if you make a purchase. By visiting our website, we automatically collect your IP address. Upon your request and in order for us to download or distribute any Content uploaded by you to MediaFire, your files become published Content and cannot be considered personally identifiable information.

Non-personally identifiable information cannot be used to identify or locate an individual person. Examples are: hashed/anonymized/pseudonymized data, click stream information, browser type, demographics, time and date, which advertisements are clicked or scrolled over and other data of interest.

We will not share personal information about you or any of your Content with any third parties except as described in this Privacy Notice.

Who We Get Information From and How Your Information Is Used
------------------------------------------------------------

Whenever you use any website, mobile application or other internet service, certain information gets created and logged automatically. The same is true when you visit MediaFire.

We use your personal information to fulfill our commitment to you and provide you with our Services. In short, it’s necessary for us to do these things in order to make our Services relevant, interesting and personal to you. We balance our interests with your rights.

How we use the information we collect depends in part on which Services you use, how you use them, and any choices you have made about information you provide.

Below are the specific purposes for which we use the information we collect from and about you.

You give us information yourself voluntarily, when you:

* Create and update an account
    
    In order to use certain features, you need to create an account with us. We ask for the bare minimum amount of necessary information - your name and email address, a user ID selected by you, and a, hopefully, complicated and very secure password. Then we assign you a unique identifying number in our database.
    
    We use this information to authenticate you when you log in and to communicate with you. Communications may be to onboard you to a particular Service to help you become more proficient in using that Service. Or, to send you administrative messages and information, notifications about changes to our Services, and updates to our agreements. Additionally, communications could be about Service features, updates, security alerts, technical notices, support and administrative messages, surveys, offers, promotions, events, and provide other news or information which may interest you or other similar messages.
    
* Make a purchase
    
    If you purchase a subscription or add-ons, you must provide certain payment and billing data to our payment processing partners, including your name, credit card information, billing address, and zip code. We do store purchase history, billing, and payment confirmation information. We’ll email you invoices confirming your purchase
    
* Contact us directly
    
    If you contact us for support or to report a problem or concern (regardless of whether you have created an account), we collect and store your messages, and other data about you like your name, email address, location, operating system, IP address, and any other data you provide or that we collect through automated means (which we cover below). We use this data to respond to you and research your question or concern.
    
* Interact with our ads
    
    Our advertisers gather information when you click on or tap ads or watch videos.
    
    The information is used to show you content that’s relevant, interesting and personal to you and to tailor advertisements across your various devices. Studying ad results helps us make decisions about our customers advertising preferences.
    
* Add names and email addresses to share folders and files
    
    To use these features, you provide names and email addresses in order to enable the functionality of the features.
    
* Add people or designate an administrator or billing representative for a business account
    
    Companies purchase seats on their account for employees or business associates and provide names and email addresses for the person ‘occupying’ each seat purchased. By necessity, each business account will need to provide contact information for their account administrator and, if different, a billing representative. If you are an individual registered user and the domain of the primary email address associated with your account is owned by your employer and was assigned to you as an employee of that organization, and your organization wishes to establish a business account, then certain information concerning past use of your individual account may become accessible to that organization’s administrator or group of users.
    
* Share your information from other companies, such as Facebook, Twitter and Google
    
    You may allow transmission of your personal information from companies like these, which may be controlled in the settings of each website, not by MediaFire. MediaFire does not ask for information about you.
    
* Provide information at an event we sponsor or participate in
    
    Your name, contact, and possibly other information, may be recorded on our servers.
    
* Your administrator integrates our Services with other services you use
    
    To do this, you will need an account.
    
* File a DMCA claim with us
    
    When you file a DMCA claim, you provide information about who you are. All the info will be kept on our servers.
    
* Accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
    
    You must accept our agreements in order to use our Services and we record your clicked acceptance.
    
* Apply for a job
    
    When a person applies for a job with MediaFire thru our website, all information is recorded and maintained on our servers. Applications received in person or by mail will be manually processed and your name and contact information will be entered into forms stored on our servers.
    

Our systems and/or third parties may automatically obtain information:

* Third-party platforms you connect with
    
    An example would be logging into MediaFire from Facebook. We need to ensure it’s you, so information is passed to us. You should review the privacy policies of every website you visit. Websites use cookies to track users and gather information.
    
* Information about your device(s)
    
    Information about your IP address, device make, model, operating system, version, and data connection type, and platform, in addition to other specifications and information will be automatically gleaned during contact with our Services.
    
    We may send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to provide updates and other relevant messages related to our Services. These may include information and in-app messages about, new services, new features, etc.
    
    Devices are discussed in more detail below.
    
* When you upload, download, collaborate, share files or otherwise interact with our Services
    
    These actions also are subject to the next point below – ‘When you interact with our website or mobile app or API’.
    
    You can create content, which may contain information about you, and grant permission for others to see, share, edit, copy and download that content based on settings you or your company administrator (if applicable) select. Some of the collaboration features of the Services display some or all of your profile information to other Service users when you share or interact with specific content. Under certain circumstances, when you share a file, your display name and profile picture may be displayed on that page, and Service users with permission to view the page can view your profile information as well. You can confirm whether certain information is visible from within the Services by contacting us or your administrator (if applicable). Please be aware that any Content posted, including information about you, by you or anyone with access to the Content, that Content may be publicly viewed and indexed by and returned in search results of search engines.
    
* When you interact with our website or mobile app or API
    
    MediaFire is always looking for ways to make our Services smarter and faster, and more innovative and useful to you. We use collective learnings about how people use our Services so we may identify areas for integration and improvement, and feedback provided directly to us to troubleshoot our Services.
    
    To that end, when you interact with us, or really any technology service today, information is gathered to help us fulfill our commitments to you to provide and protect our Services and you. To do that, we need:
    
    **Information about your behavior on MediaFire:** including, login details, date/time of visits, page view data, URL of the Web page you visited before navigating to us, referring/exit pages, click data, features you use, types of advertisements you interact with, duration of your visit, the sizes and names of the files or folders you upload, download, share or access.
    
    We use this information to personalize and improve our Services, by analyzing who we appeal to, activity patterns and trends, develop new products and services, and test and analyze new features by providing features to some users before rolling the feature out to all users. For example, by logging how often people use two different versions of a feature, we can understand which version is better.
    
    **Information about your devices** plus your browser information, browser history, IP address, the Internet Service Provider (ISP) you use, your geolocation and system configuration information is recorded.
    
    This information can help us identify unique users across multiple devices so we can monitor and analyze traffic and trends and track usage and activities in connection with our Services. We use general location information to provide country based advertising (e.g. US-based advertising, if you are in the US). We also perform studies necessary to ensure the safety and integrity of our site and mobile applications, monitor and improve the information security, and to facilitate the Services’ technical functioning, including troubleshooting and resolving issues.
    
    Information may be used as required or permitted by law, or as we, in our sole discretion, otherwise determine to be necessary to ensure the safety and integrity of our users, employees, third parties, the public, or our Services.
    

Other companies give us data:

* We may collect info from third party services we contract with
    
    We work with third-party service providers to provide website and application development, hosting, maintenance, backup, storage, virtual infrastructure, payment processing and fraud detection, analysis and other services for us, which may require them to access or use information about you. We select only well-established and trusted service partners to access information about you to perform services on our behalf.
    
* Information related to your use of third-party services
    
    The information we receive when you link or integrate our Services with a third-party service depends on the settings, permissions and privacy policy controlled by that third-party service. You should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand what data may be disclosed to us or shared with our Services.
    
    Have you ever searched for information on a mailbox and then when you visit other websites you see ads for mailboxes? We contract with advertising companies that will use your previous search history and clicks to provide advertising of specific interest to you. Your interests and interactions with ads are not stored on our servers, but we do benefit from this practice. After all, ads help support our website and the experience should be of interest to you.
    
* When you engage in an online survey initiated by us
    
    From time to time, we may perform research (online and offline) via surveys. We may engage third-party service providers to conduct such surveys on our behalf. All survey responses are voluntary, and the information collected will be used for research and reporting purposes to help us better serve our users, as a whole, by learning more about their needs and the quality of the products and services we provide. The survey responses may be utilized to determine the effectiveness of our Website, various types of communications and/or promotional activities, and innovations in products and other service offerings we might contemplate.
    
* From a social media website
    
    We allow you to use social media sites to create your MediaFire account, sign in to us, or to connect your account with the social media site. Social media sites may give us automatic access to certain personal information retained by them about you (e.g., content viewed by you, content liked by you, and information about the advertisements you have been shown or have clicked on, etc.).
    
    To sign in from a social media website, such as Facebook or Twitter, information is shared between us to authenticate your identity. Those platforms and services make information available to us through their APIs. The information we receive depends on what information you or the platform or service decide to give us. The information we get from those services depends on your settings and their privacy policies, so please check what those are.
    
    If you click on a link provided via a social media plugin, you are voluntarily establishing a connection with that respective social media site. Services, like Facebook, give you the option to post information from your account with them. The social media features on our website, like the Facebook Like Button, may allow the third-party social media provider to collect things, such as, your IP address and which page of our Services you’re visiting, and to set a cookie to enable the feature (e.g. Like Button). Your interactions with these features are governed by the social media’s own privacy policy.
    
    You should be aware that any information you provide on social media websites, community forums and publicly accessible blogs, including profile information associated with the account you use to post the information, may be read, collected, and used by any member of the public who accesses these websites. Your posts and certain profile information may remain even after you terminate your account. We urge you to consider the sensitivity of any information you input into these Services.
