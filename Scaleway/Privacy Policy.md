User data: services purchased, products used, charges, communications, etc.  
Customer relationship data: requests for support, correspondence with customers, etc.

2. How we use your data  
    Scaleway uses your data to perform and manage your contract. This includes managing your Customer account and our contractual relationship, installing, maintaining, providing and managing the service purchased or the product ordered, providing support services, processing your requests, billing the service or product, handling complaints and disputes and debt recovery procedures, which may involve third parties. Scaleway may also use automated analysis of the data you have provided to it in order to prevent possible payment difficulties and, if necessary, ask you for additional supporting documents or an advance on consumption. For more information, Scaleway recommends you to contact its Customer Service.  
    These data are retained for up to 5 years from the end of the contractual relationship and/or for the time imposed by law. Without these data, Scaleway would not be able to provide the services you have purchased.

Scaleway may also use your data in its legitimate interests. Your data will allow Scaleway to assess and improve its services and develop new services, and to implement loyalty, direct marketing, customer satisfaction and promotional campaigns.  
Unless you opt out, you may receive offers from Scaleway or its commercial partners, by post and/or telephone, and emails promoting services similar to those offered by Scaleway. With your express consent, Scaleway may email you commercial information on other different types of services.  
Your data may also be used to protect the security of the network and prevent fraud or as part of a merger, asset sale or transfer of all or part of its business, by transferring your Customer personal data to the one or more third parties involved in the transaction.  
These data will be retained for the time needed to achieve those purposes and for no more than three years after the end of the contractual relationship, as regards direct marketing purposes.

Scaleway may also use your data to respect its legal obligations (including under anti-fraud and money-laundering laws and the legislation on late payments and payment defaults) and/or to reply to requests submitted by public and governmental bodies. These data will be retained for the legal period only.

3. Your preferences regarding the collection and use of your data  
    You may access your data, rectify it, request its erasure, object to processing on legitimate grounds relating to your particular situation and exercise your right to data portability, at any time, via your Account Management Console or by emailing your request at: privacy\[at\]scaleway.com  
    By sending an email to this address, you can also define instructions for the processing of your personal data after your death. According to the nature of your request, a proof of identity may be required.  
    Scaleway is not under any obligation to erase the data needed for the purpose for which it was collected, required to ensure compliance with a statutory obligation and/or to confirm, exercise or defend rights before a court of law.

    If you are not happy with our handling of a complaint, you may contact the French Data Protection Agency (Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés or “CNIL”), in charge of regulating compliance with personal data obligations.
    
4. Security of your data  
    Scaleway takes all steps required to protect the personal data processed and carefully selects all its partners and service providers who may have to access your data.
