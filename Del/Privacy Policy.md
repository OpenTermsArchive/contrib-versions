Delicious Privacy Policy Welcome to Delicious!

Delicious Media, Inc. provides Delicious - the service that enables users to collect and discover web content through our website located at del.icio.us and by using related applications and the Delicious bookmarklet extension for your internet browser. For simplicity, we'll refer to any or all of this as the "Service".

We provide this Privacy Policy so you know what we do regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of the Service. This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the Service. Your use of the Service is your consent to the collection, disclosure, transfer, processing, storage and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.

Our Core Privacy Principles:

We take your privacy very seriously.

We collect your information to provide and improve our Service and increase your enjoyment in using it.

Providing us with your Personal Information is your choice.

What information does Delicious Science collect when we sign up?

You may use certain features of the Service without registering. however, to get access to all the features of the Service you will need to register at which time you will be asked to provide certain information most of which is optional. The only information you are required to provide is your name, (which will be publicly visible), a user name (which will be publicly visible), your email (which will not be publicly visible) and a password (which will not be publicly visible). All other information you provide when registering or later add to your profile is optional. Additional profile information you choose to provide, including your name, will be publicly available.

Personal Information is information that can be used to contact or identify you. Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, your name and email address. We use your Personal Information to provide the Service and administer your inquiries. We will also use your Personal Information to contact you with Delicious newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update your "Settings" information. (See "Changing or Deleting Information," below.) We do not collect Personal Information from users who are not registered.

Non-Identifying Information is the other information that you provide as part of registration and the administration and personalization of your user experience examples may include: zip code (on its own), gender and geolocation. We may use Non-Identifying Information alone or aggregated with the Non-Identifying Information of other users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Service and to analyze and understand how our Service is used. We may also use the combination of your Personal and Non-Identifying information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.

Service Usage Information. When you use our Service our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or online service ("Log Data"), including, but not limited to, your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our Site that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for via our Service, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Service (e.g., to understand how our users interact with advertisements), for the Service's technical administration, to increase our Service's functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors' needs. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.

Like many websites and online services, we use "cookies" on our Service to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Service, to save your preferences and personalize the Service for you, to monitor aggregate usage by Delicious Users and web traffic routing on our Service and to improve our Service generally. Third party advertisers may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the Service.

We also use "pixel tags," "clear GIFs" or similar means (individually or collectively "Pixel Tags") on our Site. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel, embedded on web pages. Pixel Tags are ordinarily not visible to users. Pixel Tags allow us to count the number of Delicious Users who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services and to generate statistics about how our Site is used.
