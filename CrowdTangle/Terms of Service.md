Terms of Service (EU)

Effective Date: October 14th, 2020

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the CrowdTangle services, website, and any other website or online service that CrowdTangle operates and that links to these Terms (collectively, the “Services”). These Terms are a legal contract between you and CrowdTangle, Inc., a company based in Menlo Park, CA, United States 94025, so it is important that you review them carefully.

### Our Services

CrowdTangle processes personal information provided from you and publicly available information from other websites. Much of the personal information that CrowdTangle processes are publicly available online information, including information that Platform Partner users choose to make public on social media websites. Such information includes users' name, username, profile picture, content shared publicly, publicly posted content (such as photos and videos) which do not have a restricted audience, as well as available metrics in connection with such publicly posted content (such as “Like” count, comment count, timing of likes and comments, and post views). CrowdTangle accesses the information to provide aggregate analytics for purposes of measuring the performance of content, monitoring trends, and providing third-party fact-checking.

### License

Subject to these Terms, CrowdTangle grants you a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, freely revocable non-sublicensable license to access and use the Services. CrowdTangle reserves all rights not expressly granted herein in the Services. CrowdTangle retains title and ownership of all rights (including copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and all other intellectual property rights) in and to the Services.

### Content

You understand that the Services are built on APIs provided by CrowdTangle and third parties. From time to time, there may be interruptions or adverse events related to those APIs that are no fault of CrowdTangle. You assume any risks associated with your use of our Services or content displayed on the Services.

### Account Suspension and Termination

If we determine that you have clearly, seriously or repeatedly breached our Terms or Policies we may modify, suspend, or terminate your access to or use of our Services. Where we take such actions, we’ll let you know and explain any options you have to request a review, unless doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of Services; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but the following provisions will survive any termination of your relationship with CrowdTangle: “License,” “Limitation of Liabilities,” “Disputes,” and “Miscellaneous.”

### Limitation of Liabilities

We work hard to provide the best Services we can and to specify clear guidelines for everyone who uses them. Our Services, however, are provided "as is," and we make no guarantees that they always will be safe, secure, or error-free, or that they will function without disruptions, delays, or imperfections. To the extent permitted by law, we also DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do not control or direct what people and others do or say, and we are not responsible for their actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or any content they share (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful, and other objectionable content).

We cannot predict when issues might arise with our Services. Accordingly, our liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and under no circumstance will we be liable to you for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services will not exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past twelve months.

  

Nothing in these Terms is intended to exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence, or to affect your statutory rights. We will exercise professional diligence in providing our Services and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment. Provided that we have acted with professional diligence, we do not accept responsibility for losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses that are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; and events beyond our reasonable control.

### Disputes

For any claim, cause of action, or dispute you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms or the Services ("claim"), you agree that it will be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the State of California will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions.

If you are a consumer and habitually reside in a Member State of the European Union, the laws of that Member State will apply to any claim, cause of action or dispute that you have against us, which arises out of or relates to these Terms or the Services, and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in that Member State that has jurisdiction over the claim.

### Feedback

We always appreciate your feedback and other suggestions about our Services, but you should know that we may use them without any restriction or obligation to compensate you, and we are under no obligation to keep them confidential.

### Updating these Terms

We work constantly to improve our Services and, as a result, we may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices. We will notify you (for example, by email or through our Services) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect, unless the changes are required by law. You accept the Terms by using the Services, and you accept any changes to the Terms by continuing to use the Services after we post the changes. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not access or use these Services.

### Miscellaneous

1.  These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us concerning the Services. In the event any provision of these Terms is held unenforceable, it will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions and will be replaced by an enforceable provision that comes closest to the intention underlying the unenforceable provision.
2.  You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and us as a result of these Terms or your access to and use of the Services.
3.  If we fail to enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing and signed by us. Nothing contained in these Terms is in derogation of our right to comply with governmental, court, and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Services or information provided to or gathered by us with respect to such use.
4.  We may assign, subcontract, or transfer these Terms or any of our rights or obligatoins in them, in whole or in part, without our prior consent, provided this will not lead to any reduction of the rights you are entitled to by virtue of these Terms or by law. You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these terms without our consent.
