Measures to protect users of third-party payment services (\*1)
---------------------------------------------------------------

**1\. Method for preserving User assets**

1. Regarding the rights stipulated in the Payment Services Act, Article 14, Item 1 and Article 31, Item 1
    
    The Company shall, as stipulated in the Payment Services Act, Article 14, Item 1, make security deposits for issuance to the official depository nearest to its principal business office. The amount of the deposits shall be, as required by the Payment Services Act, not less than half the amount of the unused balance on the base date (March 31st and September 30th of each year). (Therefore, the Company does not guarantee the full amount of prepaid payment instruments made by Users.) In the rare case that the Company should enter bankruptcy or similar, as stipulated in the Payment Services Act, Article 31, Item 1, the aforementioned security deposits shall be refunded to Users of the Company’s Services (hereafter referred to as “Users”) in preference over other creditors, as holders of prepaid payment instruments.
    
2. The Company shall deposit security deposits to the official depository nearest to its principal business office according to the terms set forth separately in the contract of issuance of security deposits or the security deposit trust contract.

**2\. Policy on compensation and countermeasures related to damages stemming from fraudulent transactions**

1. Compensation policy on prepaid payment instruments issued by the Company
    
    Regarding prepaid payment instruments held by Users, the Company shall not bear responsibility even if the prepaid payment instruments were used fraudulently by a third party against the User’s will, causing damage to the User (hereafter referred to as “Fraudulent Transactions”).
    
2. Compensation policy and inquiries related to third-party payment services
    
    The Company shall not bear any responsibility regarding damages incurred from Fraudulent Transactions through third-party payment services (Google Play, App Store, etc.) linked to prepaid payment instruments issued by the Company. Users must contact each third-party payment service for inquiries regarding compensation. However, the Company does not guarantee that each third-party payment service will provide compensation.
    
3. Policy on handling Fraudulent Transactions
    
    If a Fraudulent Transaction occurs, or is deemed to be in danger of occurring, the Company shall take into account the situation, the amount of the damages, and the possibility for multiple offenses, and if the Company deems it necessary to disclose the Fraudulent Transactions publicly, it will disclose such information as is necessary. When such a disclosure is made, Users shall be responsible for taking appropriate countermeasures.
    

(\*1) Under the Payment Services Act, only pixiv Points purchased through the iOS/Android app are applicable for “protection measures for Users under the Payment Services Act”.

1. If a Request Agreement has been formed, the relevant Fan will not be entitled to demand refunds of any Sale Proceeds already paid, except where explicitly specified otherwise. Sale Proceeds are not eligible for cooling off and cannot be refunded pursuant thereto.
    * \*Cooling off is a system enabling unconditional withdrawal of agreement applications or termination of agreements, for a certain period after application for or execution of an agreement. However, online sales are outside the scope of such systems, and cooling off systems thus cannot be used for Request Agreements as in Paragraph 1 of this article.
2. A Fan will not be entitled to Cancel or refund any already-paid Sale Proceeds for reason of the particulars of the Request Reward provided by a Creator; provided, however, that if the Creator has not provided the Request Reward in accordance with the relevant Plan, or if there is noncompliance with the agreement in formal terms (e.g., if there is an error in the file format provided by the Creator, if the Fan cannot download the Reward), the Fan shall be entitled to contact the Company about such matter using the “Inquiry Form” on the Site. If the Company has considered such communication from the Fan and determined that the Fan’s claims are reasonable, the Company will be entitled, but not obligated, to instruct the Creator to make corrections, refund the Sale Proceeds, or take other such action. In such case, the Fan and the Creator shall act in accordance with the Company’s instructions, and except where explicitly specified otherwise, the Company will bear no liability for any damage etc. arising due to any decision or action by the Company.
3. Creators shall comply with the Act against Unjustifiable Premiums and Misleading Representations, the Act on Specified Commercial Transactions, and other related laws and regulations.

4. Creators shall have fully performed their obligations to provide Request Rewards when they provide such Request Rewards to Fans in accordance with Request Agreements. The acceptance of new Co-requesting shall also terminate at such time. Payment to Creators of Sale Proceeds that the Company has received from Fans on behalf of Creators shall be as specified in Article 8.

Article 7: Deletion or Termination of Requests
----------------------------------------------

1. A Fan will be entitled to rescind the transmission of Requests by Company-prescribed procedures if the relevant Creator has not yet Accepted such Request.
2. A Request will be retracted automatically if seven days have passed from the date of transmission of such Request without the relevant Creator Accepting such Request. All Sale Proceeds advances received by the Company will be refunded to the relevant Fan.
3. If, after the formation of a Request Agreement, 60 days have passed from the date of transmission of a Request without the relevant Creator providing the Request Reward to the Fan, such Request Agreement will be deemed terminated, and all Sale Proceeds received by the Company will be refunded to such Fan.
4. The following items shall apply in the case where a Creator account has been deleted.
    1. If account deletion occurred before the formation of a Request Agreement (before Request Acceptance), the Plan set by the relevant Creator will be deemed to have been retracted, and will be deleted.
    2. If account deletion occurred after the formation of a Request Agreement (after Request Acceptance) but before full provision of the Request Reward, all Sale Proceeds paid shall be refunded to the relevant Fan.
5. The following items shall apply in the case where a Fan account has been deleted.
    1. If account deletion occurred before the formation of a Request Agreement (before Request Acceptance), the Fan will be deemed to have retracted the relevant Request.
    2. If account deletion occurred after the formation of a Request Agreement (after Request Acceptance) but before full provision of the Request Reward, the Fan is deemed to have waived the right to receive the Request Reward under such Request Agreement. No Sale Proceeds will be refunded to the Fan in such case.
6. The Company will be entitled to terminate Request Agreements before full provision of the relevant Request Rewards if it determines that a prohibited act as set forth in Article 13 has been committed. All Sale Proceeds received by the Company in connection with such Request Agreements will be refunded to the Fans of such Request Agreements.

Article 8: Payment of Sale Proceeds to Creators

5. If, in the case where a Sale Proceeds balance is less than 5,000 yen, the relevant Creator has not made a Remittance Request by the last day of the month preceding the month marking the passage of 180 days from the Request transmission date (if there is Co-requesting, then the date of transmission of the original Request), the Company shall pay such balance to a transfer account designated in advance by such Creator.

11. In the case where doubts have arisen as to Creator’s rights etc. related to a Request Reward, or where it is determined that a problem arising between a Creator and a Fan as a result of an inquiry from a User or the like has not been resolved after a certain period, the Company shall be entitled, at its discretion, to halt any remittance of Received Amounts over which such Creator holds rights; Creators shall consent to the foregoing.
12. When a Creator has resigned membership and there are Received Amounts still unpaid to such Creator, the Company shall subtract the Remittance Fee from the total of such Received Amounts, and thereupon shall remit the Received Amounts to an account designated by the Creator within five business days of the 20th of the month immediately following the month containing the date of membership resignation, or the 20th of the month immediately following such immediately following month; provided, however, that if the unpaid Received Amount is less than the Remittance Fee, the Company shall make no payment to the Creator.

In the case where a Creator has made a Remittance Request but the Company has been unable to complete the remittance due to a flaw or error in the remittance account information designated by such Creator, the Company shall be entitled to demand the amount of the reverse transaction fee of such remittance from the Creator. In such case, the Company shall contact the Creator indicating the flaw or error in remittance account information and urging another request for payment.
2. When the Company has made remittance to a remittance account designated by a Creator pursuant to a Remittance Request by such Creator, the Company will be entitled to deem such payment a payment to the Creator.

4. In the case where remittance cannot be made due to a flaw etc. in remittance destination information and the 19th of the month immediately following the month containing the date such remittance failed to be implemented is more than 180 days from the transmission date of the relevant Request, the relevant Creator will be deemed to have waived the right to receive the amount of such remittance as of the date such remittance failed to be implemented.
