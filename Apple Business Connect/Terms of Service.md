Terms of Service



Effective Date: March 17, 2025



THESE TERMS OF SERVICE (“TERMS OF SERVICE” OR “AGREEMENT”) CONSTITUTE A LEGAL

AGREEMENT AND ARE ENTERED INTO BETWEEN APPLE INC. (“APPLE”) AND THE PERSON OR

ENTITY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE BY, AND INCLUDING, SUCH ENTITY’S

AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE, INCLUDING EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, ASSIGNS, NOMINEES,

CONSULTANTS, AND CONTRACTORS (INDIVIDUALLY OR COLLECTIVELY THE “BUSINESS”, “YOU”

OR “YOUR”), AND GOVERNS YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE BUSINESS CONNECT SERVICES AND

ANY RELATED DOCUMENTATION PROVIDED BY APPLE (I) ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACCOUNT

CREATED, ACCESSED OR USED BY YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, OR (II)

ANY OTHER SERVICES, PROGRAMS, OR PRODUCTS THAT INCORPORATE BY REFERENCE THESE

TERMS OF SERVICE (COLLECTIVELY, “BUSINESS CONNECT SERVICES” OR “SERVICES”). FOR

PURPOSES OF CLARIFICATION, THE DEFINITION OF “BUSINESS” MAY INCLUDE A BRAND, AN

AGENCY THAT DIRECTLY REPRESENTS A BRAND, OR AN ORGANIZATION THAT DELIVERS DATA

FROM MULTIPLE BRANDS.



You certify to Apple and agree that You or Your representative or agent entering into these Terms

of Service is of the legal age of majority in the jurisdiction(s) in which You reside (at least 18 years

of age in many countries) and have the right and authority to enter into these Terms of Service

on Your own behalf, and that if Your representative or agent is entering into these Terms of

Service on behalf of You as a company, organization, educational institution, or agency,

instrumentality, or department of the government (“Representative(s)”), that such

Representative has the right and authority to legally bind You to all the terms and obligations of

these Terms of Service. For the avoidance of doubt, a Representative may include an agency or

company acting on behalf of You.



You agree to accept and abide by these Terms of Service as presented; changes, additions, or

deletions are not agreed to by Apple, and Apple may deny access to the Services for

noncompliance with any part of these Terms of Service or for any other reason at Apple’s sole

discretion.



THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE VERSION OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE THE ORIGINAL, GOVERNING

INSTRUMENT AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE PARTIES. IF THIS AGREEMENT IS MADE AVAILABLE

BY APPLE IN ANY LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH, THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE VERSION SHALL

GOVERN AND CONTROL IN THE EVENT OF ANY CONFLICT WITH ANY TRANSLATION INTO ANY

OTHER LANGUAGE (TO THE EXTENT THIS DOES NOT CONTRADICT MANDATORY PROVISIONS OF

APPLICABLE LAW).



In consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual promises and covenants set forth herein, You

and Apple (collectively, the “Parties”) agree as follows:

1. Using Business Connect Services



a. Access. You must log into the Services using Your Apple Account. Information associated

with Your Apple Account, such as your email address and age, will be used to determine

whether you are eligible to create an account on the Services. The name, email address,

and phone number associated with Your Apple Account will be used for Your account on

the Services. If you delete your Apple Account, you will no longer be able to log into the

Services using that Apple Account. Apple may also provide access to the Services through

a Business Connect Application Programming Interface (“Business Connect API”) that

Apple makes available to you through the use of keys associated with Your account on

the Services. You agree not to access Business Connect other than through the Business

Connect web portal or Business Connect API, and Your use must comply with the technical

or other specifications or documentation that Apple provides to You for use in connection

with the Services (“Documentation”). For the avoidance of doubt, the Business Connect

API is deemed a part of the Business Connect Services.



By using the Services, You agree that You are acting on behalf of the Business. Any

information that You submit through Your use of the Services on behalf of the Business

may be retained for the purposes of providing and improving the Services, Apple Maps,

and other associated Apple products and services.



b. Account. As a registered user of the Services, You must establish an account to use the

Services. Your Apple Account will be associated with Your Services account, any keys

provided to You by Apple with Your Services account, and any activities that occur through

use of Your Services account. You are solely responsible for Your Services account and any

associated keys, including maintaining the confidentiality and security of Your account

and such keys. You may not reveal Your Services account information or keys to anyone

else or allow anyone to use Your account or keys (except to a Representative using them

on Your behalf in compliance with this Agreement and only to the limited extent expressly

permitted by Apple in the Documentation or this Agreement), or use anyone else’s

account or keys without authorization. You are entirely responsible for all activities that

occur on or through Your Services account and through use of keys associated with Your

Services account (including by a Representative), and You agree to immediately notify

Apple of any unauthorized use or any other breach of security. Apple will not be

responsible for any losses arising out of the unauthorized or other improper use of Your

Services account or keys by You or a Representative. A registered user’s information (e.g.,

name, email, submitted Business Connect Content) may be visible by other users

registered under the same Services account (e.g., a Representative employee) for the

purposes of providing and maintaining the integrity of the Services.



c. System Requirements. Use of the Services requires compatible hardware, internet or

mobile access, certain software, and may require obtaining updates or upgrades from

time to time. Fees may apply to these system requirements. Because use of the Services

involves hardware, software, and internet and/or mobile access, Your ability to use the

Services may be affected by the performance of these factors. High-speed internet and/or

mobile access is strongly recommended. You acknowledge and agree that such system

requirements, which may be changed from time to time, are Your responsibility. You

further acknowledge and agree that the Services constitute commercial services for

commercial use.



d. Your Information. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information

required to register with Apple for the Services and at other points as may be required in

the course of using the Services, including, but not limited to, company name, physical

address, or other information as requested (“Business Information”). To the extent

Business Information also constitutes Business Connect Content, the terms that apply to

Business Connect Content will apply to such Business Information. You acknowledge and

agree that You are solely responsible for any Business Information that You or Your

Representative upload, download, post, transmit, store or otherwise make available

through Your use of the Services. Without limiting anything herein, Your information may

be used for the purposes of providing the Services, preventing fraud, and communicating

with you about the Services, including about updates, new features, and promotions. You

acknowledge and agree that Your use of the Services will require Apple to send

communications to You at the email address(es) or other means of communication that

You provide to Apple. You agree that Apple may send to You, whether by email or

otherwise, communications in the English language unless otherwise required by

mandatory provisions of applicable law. You hereby confirm Your ability to read and

comprehend communications in the English language or Your practicable ability to have

communications in the English language translated to a language of Your preference or

as mandated by the jurisdiction(s) to which You are subject, at no cost to Apple. You

hereby confirm that any Business Information You already have provided to Apple

(including, without limitation, through prior use of the Services) has been accurate,

current and complete. You further agree to maintain and update Your Business

Information as required to keep it accurate, current, and complete. You understand and

acknowledge that failure to provide, update, and maintain accurate, current, and

complete information pursuant to these Terms of Service may lead to suspension or

termination of Your access to or use of the Services at any time. To the extent You submit,

provide, or otherwise make available to Apple through Your use of the Services any

domains or websites, including as part of Your Business Information (“Your Websites”),

You hereby grant Apple permission to extract, copy, transmit and/or cache publicly-

available, business-related information and content from Your Websites (the “Website

Content”) for the purposes described herein.



You acknowledge and agree that Apple may retain in its records Your Business

Information, Your account, and information about Your use of the Services, including as

may be required by the laws and regulations of the jurisdiction(s) in which You reside or

are located or to which You are subject, or otherwise in accordance with Apple’s Privacy

Policy, available at apple.com/privacy, and that such retention may persist beyond Your

cessation of use of the Services.

e. Updates; No Support or Maintenance. Apple may extend, enhance, or otherwise modify

the Services (or any part thereof) provided hereunder at any time without notice, but

Apple shall not be obligated to provide You with any bug fixes, updates, upgrades,

modifications, enhancements, or new releases or versions (“Updates”) to the Services. If

Updates are made available by Apple, the terms of this Agreement will govern such

Updates, unless the Update is accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms

of that license will govern. You acknowledge and agree that such Updates may affect Your

ability to use, access, or interact with the Services. You acknowledge and agree that Apple

is not obligated to provide any maintenance, technical, or other support for the Services.

You also acknowledge and agree that Apple has no express or implied obligation to

announce or make available any Updates to the Services to You or anyone in the future.

You further acknowledge that such Updates may require You to change or update Your

website or application at Your own cost. Apple shall not be liable for any losses, damages,

or costs of any kind incurred by You or any other party arising out of or related to any

such suspension or discontinuation or any such Updates of the Services.



f. Availability. Apple does not guarantee the availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability,

or timeliness of any data or information displayed by the Services. You are responsible for

Your use of the Services, and if You use such Services, then it is Your responsibility to

maintain an appropriate alternate backup of all Your content, information, and data,

including but not limited to any Business Information or Business Connect Content that

You may provide to Apple as part of Your use of the Services. You understand there may

be storage capacity, transmission, and/or transactional limits for the Services. If You reach

such limits, then You may be unable to use the Services or may be unable to access or

retrieve data from the Services.



2. License Grant and Restrictions



a. Your Use of the Services. Subject to these Terms of Service, You are granted a limited,

non-exclusive, revocable, non-sublicenseable, and non-transferable right to access and

format now known or hereafter devised, provided that You may make and distribute a

reasonable number of copies of any analyses, reports, data, and other information

developed by Apple relating to use of the Services (“Business Connect Analytics”) and any

Documentation provided by Apple herein for internal use only and, in connection with

any technical specifications, for the sole purpose of developing or testing the Business

Connect API. To the extent You choose to use the Services, You do so at Your own initiative

and agree to use the Services only as expressly permitted in these Terms of Service, in

guidance as required by Apple. You agree to access and use the Services only through the

mechanisms provided by Apple and in accordance with any Documentation.

Apple may use Business Connect Content to provide and improve the Services, Apple

discovery of, and responses to end-user queries related to, Your Business through Apple

written, oral, visual, electronic, or any other tangible or intangible form), with nonpublic,

proprietary, or confidential information or materials, whether or not labeled or designated

as confidential, including access to pre-release features that are not generally available to the

public (collectively, “Apple Confidential Information”). You agree that all pre-release features

(including pre-release documentation), and other Apple materials that disclose pre-release

features, are deemed Apple Confidential Information; provided however that pre-release

features will no longer be confidential upon their commercial release. You further agree that

data and any user related activity related to the Services that is obtained, generated or

created by or on behalf of Apple will be deemed Apple Confidential Information.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Apple Confidential Information will not include: (i)

information that is generally and legitimately available to the public through no fault or

breach of Yours; (ii) information that is generally made available to the public by Apple; (iii)

information that is independently developed by you without the use of any Apple

Confidential Information; or (iv) information that was rightfully obtained from a third party

who had the right to transfer or disclose it to you without limitation.



You agree to protect Apple Confidential Information using at least the same degree of care

that you use to protect your own confidential information of similar importance, but no less

than a reasonable degree of care. You agree to use Apple Confidential Information solely for

the purpose of exercising your rights and performing your obligations under these Terms of

Service and agree not to use Apple Confidential Information for any other purpose, including

for Your own or any third party’s benefit. You further agree not to disclose or disseminate

Apple Confidential Information to anyone other than: (i) those employees and consultants

who have a need to know in order to accomplish such purpose and who are bound by a

written agreement that prohibits unauthorized use or disclosure of the Apple Confidential

Information; or (ii) except as otherwise agreed or permitted in writing by Apple. You will be

responsible for any violation of the terms of this Section by Your employees or consultants.

You may disclose Apple Confidential Information to the extent required by applicable law,

provided that You take reasonable steps to notify Apple of such requirement before

disclosing the Apple Confidential Information and to obtain protective treatment of the Apple

Confidential Information. You acknowledge that damages for improper disclosure of Apple

Confidential Information may be irreparable; therefore, Apple is entitled to seek equitable

relief, including injunction and preliminary injunction, in addition to all other remedies.

foregoing, Personal Data associated with Your use of the Services, including name, email

address, and phone number, will be visible to other users registered under the same Services

account in connection with providing and maintaining the Services.



Consistent with Apple’s policy on tracking, You agree that in connection with the Services,

You will not, and will not attempt to, access, use, or otherwise process any information that

can be used to track any individual or device, except with the user’s explicit permission by

means of the App Tracking Transparency APIs. Tracking is defined by Apple’s policies and

guidelines, including at https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use.



9. Termination or Suspension. Either Party, in its sole discretion, may terminate these Terms of

Service at any time upon notice without cause; provided, however, that any continued use of

the Services by You after such notice of termination will be subject to the then-current Terms

of Service. You may provide notice by e-mailing Apple’s Customer Support team. Upon any

expiration or termination of this Agreement, except as expressly otherwise provided in these

Terms of Service: (a) all rights, licenses, consents, and authorizations granted by either Party

to the other hereunder will immediately terminate except for the licenses granted to Apple

herein which will survive any expiration or termination of these Terms of Service; and (b) You

will cease all use of the Services. THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN SECTIONS 2(c),

2(d), AND 3 THROUGH 17 WILL SURVIVE THE EXPIRATION OR TERMINATION OF THESE TERMS

OF SERVICE. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THESE TERMS OF SERVICE,

APPLE MAY, IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, IMMEDIATELY AND

WITHOUT ADVANCE NOTICE SUSPEND, TERMINATE, OR OTHERWISE DENY YOUR ACCESS TO

OR USE OF ALL OR ANY PART OF THE SERVICES, AND APPLE WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR

TO ANY THIRD PARTY SHOULD IT EXERCISE SUCH RIGHTS. This Section 9 does not limit any of

Apple’s other rights or remedies, whether at law, in equity, or under these Terms of Service.



10. Modification or Amendment of Terms of Service. Apple reserves the right, at its discretion,

to modify or amend these Terms of Service at any time. Such modifications and additional

terms and conditions will be effective immediately and incorporated into these Terms of

Service. You acknowledge and agree that regularly reviewing these Terms of Service is Your

responsibility. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ANY MODIFICATION TO THE TERMS OF SERVICE,

YOU SHALL IMMEDIATELY STOP ALL ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICES. YOUR

CONTINUED USE OF THE SERVICES AFTER ANY MODIFICATION TO THE TERMS OF SERVICE

SHALL BE DEEMED AS YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS OF SERVICE AS MODIFIED.



11. Relationship of the Parties. These Terms of Service create an independent contractor

relationship between You and Apple. No employment relationship, partnership, or joint

venture is created by these Terms of Service, and neither Apple nor You shall hold itself out

13. Governing Law. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA,

EXCLUDING ITS CONFLICTS OF LAW RULES, GOVERN THESE TERMS OF SERVICE AND YOUR

USE OF THE SERVICES, AND THAT THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION FOR ANY PROCEEDING

RELATING IN ANY WAY TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF

CALIFORNIA. YOU HEREBY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE FOREGOING CHOICE OF

LAW, PERSONAL JURISDICTION, OR VENUE.



14. Compliance. You agree that the Services may not be used: (a) in any U.S. embargoed

countries; or (b) by anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated

Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Denied Persons List or Entity List or any

other restricted party lists. By agreeing to these Terms of Service, You represent and warrant

that You are not located in any such country or on any such list. You also agree that you will

not use the Services for any purposes prohibited by applicable law in the United States or

other territories, including, without limitation, the development, design, manufacture or

production of nuclear, missile, chemical or biological weapons.



15. Third Party Materials. The Services may display, include, or make available information or

services from third parties (“Third Party Materials”) or provide links to certain third-party web

sites. Apple makes no representation that the Services or Third-Party Materials are

appropriate, accurate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent You choose

to use or access Third-Party Materials, You do so at your own initiative and are responsible

for compliance with any applicable laws, regulations, terms or other requirements. Apple

does not warrant or endorse and does not assume and will not have any liability or

responsibility to you or any other person for any third-party services, Third Party Materials or

web sites, or for any other materials, products, or services of third parties. The Service and

Third-Party Materials may not be available in all languages or in all countries or regions. Apple

may use third party mapping services to support Apple Maps in certain regions. Apple may

provide your Business Connect Content to providers of such services solely to enable the

display of your Business Connect Content to Apple Maps users in those regions.



16. Other Agreements. Any other agreements in effect between Apple and You (collectively, the

“Other Agreements”) are separate from these Terms of Service. Except as otherwise specified

in writing herein or in the Other Agreements, these Terms of Service will in no event be

deemed to be the terms of the Other Agreements and vice versa. No breach of these Terms

of Service will constitute a breach of the Other Agreements and vice versa. You acknowledge

and agree that the performance of Your obligations under these Terms of Service shall not be

conditioned on Apple entering into any further agreements or providing any additional

representations or warranties relating to the Services.



17. Miscellaneous. These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between You and

Apple and govern Your use of the Services, superseding all prior agreements between You

and Apple except as set forth in the Other Agreements. You may not assign these Terms of

Service, including, without limitation, by operation of law or merger, without Apple’s prior

written approval, and any attempt to assign these Terms of Service without such prior written

approval is void. If any part of these Terms of Service is held invalid or unenforceable, that

portion shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as

possible, the original intentions of the parties, and the remaining portions shall remain in full

force and effect. Apple’s failure to enforce any right or provisions in these Terms of Service

will not constitute a waiver of such provision, or any other provision of these Terms of Service.

Apple will not be responsible for failures to fulfill any obligations due to causes beyond its

control. These Terms of Service are not to the benefit of any third parties. The conjunction

“or” will be understood in its inclusive sense (and/or).
