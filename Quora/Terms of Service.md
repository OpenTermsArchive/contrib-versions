Terms of Service

Last Updated: July 24, 2023

Welcome to Quora! Quora is a platform to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world through our websites and applications (“Quora” or the “Quora Platform”).

These terms of service (“Terms”) are an agreement between you and Quora, Inc. (“Quora” “we” or “us”). These Terms govern your use of the products and services we offer. By using Quora, you consent to these Terms.

Your access to and use of Quora is also subject to our policies, including our [Privacy Policy](https://www.quora.com/about/privacy "www.quora.com") and [Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.quora.com/about/acceptable_use "www.quora.com").

IMPORTANT ARBITRATION NOTICE: IF YOU ARE IN THE UNITED STATES OR CANADA, YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND QUORA WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION. WE EXPLAIN SOME EXCEPTIONS AND HOW YOU CAN OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION BELOW IN SECTION 11.

1. Your Use of Quora

1.1 Age requirements and responsibility of parents and legal guardians. Use of Quora by anyone under 13 years of age is prohibited. You represent that you are at least the age of majority in the jurisdiction where you live or, if you are not, your parent or legal guardian must consent to these Terms and affirm that they accept these Terms on your behalf and bear responsibility for your use. If you are accepting these Terms on behalf of someone else or an entity, you confirm that you have the legal authority to bind that person or entity to these Terms.

1.2 Registration. When you set up a profile on the Quora Platform, you will be asked to provide certain information about yourself. You agree to provide us accurate information when you create your account on Quora. We will treat information you provide as part of registration in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://www.quora.com/about/privacy "www.quora.com"). You should take care in maintaining the confidentiality of your password.

1.3 Compliance with Quora Policies.

3\. Your Content

3.1 Your Content. Quora enables you to add posts, text, photos, videos, links, and other files and information to share with other users of Quora. All material that you upload, publish, display, or transmit to others via Quora will be referred to collectively as “Your Content.” You, or your licensors, as applicable, retain ownership of the copyright and other intellectual property in Your Content, subject to the non-exclusive rights granted below.

You acknowledge and agree that, as part of using Quora, Your Content may be viewed by the general public. Please understand where you are posting on Quora and choose the right space, features, and settings for you and Your Content.

By submitting, posting, displaying, or transmitting Your Content on or through the Quora Platform, you grant Quora and its affiliated companies a nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty free, fully paid up, transferable, sublicensable (through multiple tiers), license to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, create derivative works from, publish, transmit, store, display and distribute, translate, communicate and make available to the public, and otherwise use Your Content in connection with the operation or use of the Quora Platform or, subject to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.quora.com/about/privacy "www.quora.com"), the promotion, advertising or marketing of the Quora Platform or our business partners, in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed), including via means of automated distribution, such as through an application programming interface (also known as an “API”). You agree that, subject to and consistent with our [Privacy Policy](https://www.quora.com/about/privacy "www.quora.com"), this license includes the right for Quora to make Your Content available to other companies, organizations, business partners, or individuals who collaborate with Quora for the syndication, broadcast, communication and making available to the public, distribution or publication of Your Content on the Quora Platform or through other media or distribution methods.

Once you post an answer to a question, you may edit or delete your answer at any time from public display on [https://www.quora.com](https://www.quora.com/ "www.quora.com"), except in the case of anonymously posted answers. However, we may not be able to control removal of the answer from display on syndicated channels or other previously distributed methods outside of [https://www.quora.com](https://www.quora.com/ "www.quora.com"). Quora may remove suspected spam from your answers. Once you post a question, it may be edited or deleted by other users or by Quora at any time. Any edits and changes made by you may be visible to other users. The right for Quora to copy, display, transmit, publish, perform, distribute, store, modify, and otherwise use any question you post, and sublicense those rights to others, is perpetual and irrevocable, to the maximum extent permitted by law, except as otherwise specified in these Terms.

You acknowledge and agree that Quora may preserve Your Content and may also disclose Your Content and related information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process, applicable laws or government requests; (b) enforce these Terms of Service; (c) respond to claims that any of Your Content violates the rights of third parties; (d) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or (e) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Quora, its users, or the public.

You understand that we may modify, adapt, or create derivative works from Your Content in order to transmit, display or distribute it over computer networks, devices, service providers, and in various media. We also may remove or refuse to publish Your Content, in whole or part, at any time.

You further give us the permission and authority to act as your nonexclusive agent to take enforcement action against any unauthorized use by third parties of any of Your Content outside of the Quora Platform or in violation of our Terms of Service.

3.3 Your Responsibilities for Your Content. By posting Your Content on the Quora Platform, you represent and warrant to us that: (1) you have the ownership rights, or you have obtained all necessary licenses or permissions to use Your Content and grant us the rights to use Your Content as provided for under these Terms, and (2) that posting Your Content violates no intellectual property or personal right of others or any other applicable law or regulation, including any laws or regulations requiring disclosure that you have been compensated for Your Content. You accept full responsibility for avoiding infringement of the intellectual property or personal rights of others or violation of laws and regulations in connection with Your Content. You are responsible for ensuring that Your Content does not violate Quora’s [Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.quora.com/about/acceptable_use "www.quora.com"), [Copyright Policy](https://www.quora.com/about/copyright "www.quora.com"), [Trademark Policy](https://www.quora.com/about/trademark "www.quora.com"), any other published Quora policy, or any applicable law or regulation.

11\. Legal Disputes and Arbitration Agreement for Users

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.

Except for Section 11.10 (Exclusive Venue for Litigation) below, this Section 11 applies only to Quora users in the United States and Canada.

11.1 Initial Dispute Resolution. We are available by email at [support@quora.com](mailto:support@quora.com "mailto:support@quora.com") and by regular post at Quora, Inc., 605 Castro Street, Mountain View, CA 94041 to address any concerns you may have regarding your use of the Quora Platform. Most concerns may be quickly resolved in this manner. The parties agree to use best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations with us, before initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.

For any dispute that Quora initiates, we will send our written description of the dispute to the email address associated with your Quora account. The written description must be on an individual basis and provide, at minimum, the following information: your name; a description of the nature or basis of the claim or dispute; and the specific relief sought. If the dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after receipt of the written description of the dispute, you and Quora agree to the further dispute resolution provisions below.

The aforementioned informal dispute resolution process is a prerequisite and condition precedent to commencing any formal dispute resolution proceeding. The parties agree that any relevant limitations period and filing fees or other deadlines will be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process.

Only after the parties have engaged in a good-faith effort to resolve the dispute in accordance with this Initial Dispute Resolution process, and only if those efforts fail, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims using the procedures set forth below in Sections 11.4 & 11.5. If you are initiating arbitration, a copy of the demand shall also be emailed to [legal@quora.com](mailto:legal@quora.com "mailto:legal@quora.com"). If Quora is initiating arbitration, it will serve a copy of the demand to the email address associated with your Quora account. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions in accordance with the National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”) rules and procedures for any frivolous claims or submissions the arbitrator determines have not been filed in good faith, as well as for a party's failure to comply with this Section. The applicable NAM rules and procedures are available at [Homepage](http://www.namadr.com/ "www.namadr.com") or by emailing National Arbitration and Mediation’s Commercial Dept at [commercial@namadr.com](mailto:commercial@namadr.com "mailto:commercial@namadr.com").

11.2 Agreement to Binding Arbitration. If an agreed upon solution is not reached through informal dispute resolution as outlined above within a period of sixty (60) days pursuant to the initial dispute resolution procedure provided in Section 11.1 above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration to formally resolve claims, subject to the terms and exclusion set forth below.

You and Quora agree that all claims, disputes, or disagreements that may arise out of the interpretation or performance of the Agreement, which includes the Terms of Service (including its formation, performance, and breach) or payments by or to Quora, or that in any way relate to the provision or use of Quora Services, your relationship with Quora, or any other dispute with Quora, shall be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration in accordance with this Section 11.2 (collectively, the "Arbitration Agreement"). This includes claims that arose, were asserted, or involve facts occurring before the existence of this Arbitration Agreement or any prior agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Arbitration Agreement, in accordance with the notice and opt-out provisions set forth in Section 11.9). This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") in all respects and evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. You and Quora expressly agree that the FAA shall exclusively govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. If for whatever reason the rules and procedures of the FAA cannot apply, the state law governing arbitration agreements in the state in which you reside shall apply.

Except as set forth in Sections 11.7 & 11.8, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, and any dispute regarding the payment of administrative or arbitrator fees (including the timing of such payments and remedies for nonpayment). The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.

The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court. YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND QUORA ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

Except as set forth in Sections 11.5 & 11.6 below, if any provision of this Arbitration Agreement is found by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the arbitrator or court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions thereof remain in full force and effect.

11.3 Location. If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place in the County where you reside. For residents in Canada (and anywhere else outside the United States), arbitration shall be initiated in the County of Santa Clara, State of California, United States of America, unless you and Quora otherwise agree or unless the designated arbitrator determines that such venue would be unreasonably burdensome to any party, in which case the arbitrator shall have the discretion to select another venue. For any arbitration conducted in California, You and Quora agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Santa Clara County, California, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and in connection with any such proceeding, further agree to accept service of process by U.S. mail and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available.

11.4 Rules. The arbitration will be administered by NAM and resolved before a single arbitrator. If NAM is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitration provider, but in no event shall any arbitration be administered by the American Arbitration Association.

Except as modified by this "Dispute Resolution" provision, NAM will administer the arbitration in accordance with the NAM Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, Fees For Disputes When One of the Parties is a Consumer and the Mass Filing Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures in effect at the time any demand for arbitration is filed with NAM, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class or representative actions. The applicable NAM rules and procedures are available at [Homepage](http://www.namadr.com/ "www.namadr.com") or by emailing National Arbitration and Mediation’s Commercial Dept at [commercial@namadr.com](mailto:commercial@namadr.com "mailto:commercial@namadr.com").

You are responsible for your own attorneys’ fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise. The parties agree that NAM has discretion to reduce the amount or modify the timing of any administrative or arbitration fees due under NAM’s Rules where it deems appropriate (including as specified in Section 11.5, provided that such modification does not increase the costs to you, and you further agree that you waive any objection to such fee modification. The parties also agree that a good-faith challenge by either party to the fees imposed by NAM does not constitute a default, waiver, or breach of this Section 11.4 while such challenge remains pending before NAM, the arbitrator, and/or a court of competent jurisdiction, and that any and all due dates for those fees shall be tolled during the pendency of such challenge.

Any arbitration demand or counterclaim asserted by either party must contain sufficient information to provide fair notice to the other party of the asserting party’s identity, the claims being asserted, and the factual allegations on which they are based. The arbitrator and/or NAM may require amendment of any demand or counterclaim that does not satisfy these requirements. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions for any claims the arbitrator determines to be frivolous or improper (under the standard set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11).

If the amount in controversy does not exceed $10,000 and you do not seek injunctive or declaratory relief, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Quora submit to the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If the amount in controversy exceeds $10,000 or seeks declaratory or injunctive relief, either party may request (or the arbitrator may determine) to hold a hearing, which shall be via videoconference or telephone conference unless the parties agree otherwise.

Subject to the applicable NAM rules and procedures, the parties agree that the arbitrator will have the discretion to allow the filing of dispositive motions if they are likely to efficiently resolve or narrow issues in dispute. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, all arbitration proceedings will be confidential and closed to the public and any parties other than you and Quora (and each of the parties’ authorized representatives and agents), and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award (provided that the party seeking confirmation shall seek to file such records under seal to the extent permitted by law).

11.5 Mass Filing Rules. To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, in the event 50 or more similar arbitration demands (those asserting the same or substantially similar facts or claims, and seeking the same or substantially similar relief) presented by or with the assistance or coordination of the same law firm(s) or organization(s) are submitted to NAM (or another arbitration provider selected in accordance with Section 11.4 if NAM is unavailable) against Quora within reasonably close temporal proximity ("Mass Filing"), the parties agree (i) to administer the Mass Filing in batches of 50 demands per batch (to the extent there are fewer than 50 arbitration demands left over after the batching described above, a final batch will consist of the remaining demands) with only one batch filed, processed, and adjudicated at a time; (ii) to designate one arbitrator for each batch; (iii) to accept applicable fees, including any related fee reduction determined by NAM (or another arbitration provider selected in accordance with Section 11.4 if NAM is unavailable) in its discretion; (iv) that no other demands for arbitration that are part of the Mass Filing may be filed, processed, or adjudicated until the prior batch of 50 is filed, processed, and adjudicated; (v) that fees associated with a demand for arbitration included in a Mass Filing, including fees owed by Quora and the claimants, shall only be due after your demand for arbitration is included in a set of batch proceedings and that batch is properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication; and (vi) that the staged process of batched proceedings, with each set including 50 demands, shall continue until each demand (including your demand) is adjudicated or otherwise resolved. Arbitrator selection for each batch shall be conducted to the greatest extent possible in accordance with the applicable NAM rules and procedures for such selection, and the arbitrator will determine the location where the proceedings will be conducted.

You agree to cooperate in good faith with Quora and the arbitration provider to implement such a “batch approach” or other similar approach to provide for an efficient resolution of claims, including the payment of combined reduced fees, set by NAM in its discretion, for each batch of claims.

The parties further agree to cooperate with each other and the arbitration provider or arbitrator to establish any other processes or procedures that the arbitration provider or arbitrator believe will provide for an efficient resolution of claims. Any disagreement between the parties as to whether this provision applies or as to the process or procedure for batching shall be resolved by a Procedural Arbitrator appointed by NAM, as defined by NAM’s Supplemental Rules. This "Batch Arbitration" provision shall in no way be interpreted as increasing the number of claims necessary to trigger the applicability of NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures or authorizing class arbitration of any kind. Unless Quora otherwise consents in writing, Quora does not agree or consent to class arbitration, private attorney general arbitration, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as set forth in section 11.6 and this section 11.5. If your demand for arbitration is included in the Mass Filing, your claims will remain tolled until your demand for arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or is settled.

The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the applicable NAM rules and procedures. The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages on an individual basis and to grant, on an individual basis, any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual to the extent available under applicable law, the arbitral forum's rules, and this Arbitration Agreement. The parties agree that the damages and/or other relief must be consistent with Section 11.6 and also must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitation of Liability" section of the Agreement as to the types and the amounts of damages or other relief for which a party may be held liable. No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration. Attorneys' fees will be available to the prevailing party in the arbitration only if authorized under applicable substantive law governing the claims in the arbitration.

11.6 Class Action and Class Arbitration Waiver. YOU AND QUORA ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, ANY ARBITRATION SHALL BE CONDUCTED IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY ONLY AND NOT AS A CLASS OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF CONSOLIDATED ACTION AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO RESOLVE AN INDIVIDUAL PARTY’S CLAIM, UNLESS QUORA PROVIDES ITS CONSENT TO CONSOLIDATE IN WRITING.

If there is a final judicial determination that applicable law precludes enforcement of this Paragraph’s limitations as to a particular remedy, then that remedy (and only that remedy) must be severed from the arbitration and may be sought in court. The parties agree, however, that any adjudication of remedies not subject to arbitration shall be stayed pending the outcome of any arbitrable claims and remedies.

If there is a final judicial determination that either the Class Arbitration Action and Collective Relief Waiver or the provisions in Section 11.4 are not enforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief, then the parties agree that that particular claim or request for relief may proceed in court but shall be severed and stayed pending arbitration of the remaining claims. This provision does not prevent you or Quora from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.

11.7 Exception: Small Claims Court Claims. Notwithstanding the parties’ agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may also elect to have disputes or claims resolved in a small claims court that are within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction regardless of what forum the filing party initially chose. Either party may also seek a declaratory judgment or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction regarding whether a party’s claims are time-barred or may be brought in small claims court. Seeking such relief shall not waive a party’s right to arbitration under this agreement, and any filed arbitrations related to any action filed pursuant to this paragraph shall automatically be stayed pending the outcome of such action.

11.8 Exception: Intellectual Property and Content Claims. Notwithstanding the parties’ agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, this binding arbitration section does not apply to disputes relating to either party’s intellectual property rights (trademark, copyright, patent, and trade secret) or violations of Quora’s Acceptable Use Policy. For further clarification, disputes relating to your privacy rights are not excepted from this binding arbitration section.

11.9 30 Day Right to Opt-Out. You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in Sections 11.4-11.6 by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out by emailing us at [arbitration.optout@quora.com](mailto:arbitration.optout@quora.com?subject=QuoraTOSArbitrationOptOut "mailto:arbitration.optout@quora.com?subject=QuoraTOSArbitrationOptOut"). [](https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/ "www.jamsadr.com")The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of registering to use the Quora Platform, otherwise you will be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those sections. If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them. Quora will continue to honor any valid opt outs if you opted out of arbitration in a prior version of the Agreement pursuant to the requirements set forth in that version. If you do not timely opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, such action shall constitute mutual acceptance of the terms of these “Dispute Resolution” provisions by you and Quora.

11.10 Changes to this section. Quora will provide 30 days’ notice of any changes to this section. Changes will become effective on the 30th day and apply to all claims not yet filed. If you continue to use the site after the 30th day, you agree that any unfiled claims of which Quora does not have actual notice are subject to the revised clause.

If you reject any such changes by opting out of the Arbitration Agreement, you may exercise your right to a trial by jury or judge, as permitted by applicable law, but any prior existing agreement to arbitrate disputes under a prior version of the Arbitration Agreement will not apply to claims not yet filed. If Quora changes this "Dispute Resolution" section after the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement), you agree that your continued use of the Product(s) or Services 30 days after such change will be deemed acceptance of those changes. If you do not agree to such change, you may opt out by providing notice as described in Section 11.9.

11.11 Exclusive Venue for Litigation. If you are not a user in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, to the extent that the arbitration provisions set forth in Section 11) do not apply, or if you have opted out of arbitration, the parties agree that any litigation between them must be filed exclusively in state or federal courts located in Santa Clara County, California (except for small claims court actions which may be brought in the county where you reside). These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflict of laws provision and the parties expressly consent to exclusive jurisdiction in Santa Clara County, California for any litigation other than small claims court actions. In the event of litigation relating to these Terms of Service, the parties agree to waive, to the maximum extent permitted by law, any right to a jury trial, except where a jury trial waiver is not permissible under applicable law.

If you are a user in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, this section does not deprive you of any rights or protections you have under the law of the country of your residence or access to courts in that country.
