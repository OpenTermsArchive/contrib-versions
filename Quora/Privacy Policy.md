Information We Collect

We collect information directly from you, from third parties, and automatically through your use of the Quora Platform.

*   Account and Profile Data. When you create an account and profile on the Quora Platform, we collect your name, email address, and other information you provide, such as topics that you know about or find interesting. You can choose to add your photo, country of residence, place of employment, education history, and any other information to your public-facing profile. Once you create a profile, others will be able to see certain information about your activity on the Quora Platform, such as the questions and answers you post, your followers and who you follow, topics of interest to you, and your credentials.
*   Your Content. We collect the information and content that you post to the Quora Platform, including your questions, answers, comments, photos, and the edit history to your content. Unless you have posted certain content anonymously, your content, date and time stamps, and all associated comments are publicly viewable on the Quora Platform. Your content may be indexed by search engines and be republished elsewhere on the Internet in accordance with our Terms of Service.
*   Communication Records. We maintain a record when you communicate with us via email, through the Quora Platform, or otherwise. The Quora Platform also provides a “Messages” feature that allows you to send direct messages through the Quora Platform to other users. We store these communications and information related to these messages, such as the date of the communication and to whom it was sent.

When you log in using this method, we collect your name and email address associated with that third party application for authentication and identity verification purposes. You can also choose to import your contacts to your Quora account to connect with your friends on the Quora Platform.

We and our third party providers use cookies, log files, pixel tags, local storage objects, and other similar technologies to automatically collect information about your activities, such as your searches, page views, date and time of your visit, and other information about your use of the Quora Platform.

In addition, users may be able to send communications and invites to their imported contacts through their Quora account, by email, text, or phone. You can opt out of receiving emails or other notifications from us by configuring your Emails and Notifications settings, but we will still send you transactional emails about your account.
