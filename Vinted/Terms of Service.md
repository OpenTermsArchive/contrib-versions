**TERMS AND CONDITIONS** 

**Last Updated:  5 April, 2022** 

The platform VINTED is managed and hosted by **VINTED INC.** (hereinafter referred to as "**VINTED**," “**we**,” “**us**,” “**our**”), a company registered in Delaware, with a business location at C/o AG Accounting, 735 Geary St. #303, San Francisco, CA 94109. These Terms and Conditions (“**Terms**”) are a legally binding agreement between you and VINTED regarding your access and use of the Site. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SITE, YOU CONFIRM THAT YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND THAT YOU AGREE TO COMPLY WITH THEM AND BE LEGALLY BOUND BY THEM.

1.  **INTRODUCTION**

1.1 **Welcome to the Site.** Please read these Terms carefully. These Terms set forth the terms and conditions by which you may access and use the Site. (In particular, please read Section 17 (Liability Limitations; Warranty Disclaimers) carefully as it affects your rights and will have a substantial impact on how claims between you and VINTED are resolved.) If you do not agree to these Terms, you are not authorized to access or use the Site. If you agree to these Terms, you will be able to access and use our Site as a Visitor or as a User, and you will have the opportunity to be a Buyer and a Seller of Items on the Site. VINTED does not buy, sell, exchange, or donate Items shown on the Site. VINTED is an online hosting service and offers Intermediary Services. VINTED functions as an intermediary between private buyers and sellers, and VINTED is not a party to any Transactions between Users. (Capitalized terms are defined in Section 2 of these Terms.) 

1.2 **Who Can Not Use the Site.** The Site is not intended for the following persons:

(i) **Non-US Residents.** You are only authorized to use the Site if you are a resident of the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico. Do not use the Site if you do not live in one of these areas. If you live in a different area, VINTED may have a separate Site for your area.

VINTED may request a User to verify their Account for security purposes from time to time.

(iii) The sale, exchange, or donation, and the use or possession, of the item must not violate the rights of any third party (including any intellectual property rights) and must not violate any applicable local, national, or international law or regulation. The item must be safe and cannot be counterfeit.

(iv) The item must comply with all applicable regulatory requirements on the market unless there is an agreement to the contrary between the Buyer and the Seller.

3.2 **Preparing a Listing.** To list an item in the Catalog, the Seller must complete a questionnaire, which includes selecting a category that most accurately represents the Item being listed. The Seller must comply with all Catalog Rules relating to the listing of Items. 

3.3 **Offer for Sale.** When a Seller lists an Item in the Catalog and the listing is published on the Site, this constitutes an offer for sale of the relevant Item by the Seller, which may be accepted by a Buyer.

3.4 **Modifying a Listing.** The Seller who has listed an Item may withdraw the Item or amend the Listing (including the price) anytime before a Buyer clicks on the “Buy now” button for such Item.

3.5 **Additional Services.** The Seller may decide to purchase Additional Services, such as services designed to improve the visibility of their Items on the Site. Details about Additional Services (including pricing) are provided in the [Price List.](https://www.vinted.co.uk/pricelist) 

4.  **BUYING ITEMS ON THE SITE** 

4.1 **Buying an Item.** A Buyer can use the “Buy now” button to buy an Item. For safety reasons, we always recommend that Buyers buy in-app or on-web by using the "Buy now" button, in which case the Buyer is covered by Buyer Protection (see Section 5 below for additional details). If a Buyer concludes the Transaction outside of the Site directly with the Seller and without using our “Buy now” button, Buyer Protection will not apply and VINTED will not be able to assist the Buyer in the event any problems occur with the Transaction.

4.2 **Pay now.** By using the “Pay now” button and confirming the Buyer’s details during the Checkout process, the Buyer acknowledges that their acceptance of the Seller’s offer has been made in consideration of the Item as described in the Item’s description. Both the Buyer and the Seller acknowledge that using the “Pay now” button and confirming the Buyer’s details creates a legally binding contract between the Buyer and the Seller, and the Buyer has a commitment to pay for the Item and the Seller has a commitment to transfer ownership of the Item. To avoid doubt, VINTED is not a party to this contract.

5.  **BUYER PROTECTION SERVICE**

5.1 **Buyer Protection.** Buyer Protection is added for a fee to every purchase made using the “Buy now” button. Buyer Protection enables a Buyer to seek a refund in certain circumstances, as further described in this Section 5.

5.2 **Buyer Protection Fee**. The Buyer Protection Fee is calculated as follows: 

*   A fixed amount of $0.70; plus
*   An amount equal to 5% of the Item price agreed between the Buyer and the Seller (not including shipping costs, any additional costs and applicable taxes).

5.3 **Process for Receiving a Refund Under Buyer Protection.** Buyer Protection includes the right for a Buyer to seek a refund in the event (i) an Item is lost during shipping or (ii) the delivered Item is damaged or (iii) is significantly not as described in the listing for the Item. In such circumstances, the Buyer must report the issue to VINTED within two (2) days after the date the Item is marked as ‘delivered’ in VINTED’s system (VINTED notifies the Buyer when this occurs) (such 2-day period, the “**Dispute Filing Period**”). If there is a mistake in the reported ‘delivered’ date and the item has not been actually delivered to the Buyer, the Buyer must still report the issue within the Dispute Filing Period; otherwise, the Transaction will be marked as completed. To report an issue to VINTED, the Buyer must click the “I have an Issue” button in their Private Message with the Seller within the Dispute Filing Period. Otherwise, the Transaction will be completed and money will be transferred to the Seller. 

5.3.1. **Items Lost During Shipping.** If the Buyer did not receive an Item, the Buyer must inform VINTED by clicking on the “I have an issue” button within the Dispute Filing Period. This will suspend the Transaction and the Total Price will be retained until VINTED investigates where the Item is and receives confirmation from the shipping provider that the Item is confirmed lost. Once the Item has been confirmed as lost, VINTED will request, and ADYEN N.V. will issue a refund to the Buyer for the Total Price.

5.3.2. **Damaged Items or Significantly Not As Described** **Items**. If the Buyer receives an Item that has been damaged during shipment or is significantly not as described in the Item’s listing, the Buyer must inform VINTED by clicking on the “I have an issue” button within the Dispute Filing Period. This will suspend the Transaction and the Total Price will not be released to the Seller until the following process is complete: 

(i) The Buyer and Seller can resolve the issue between themselves in their Private Messages and VINTED will not interfere. 

(ii) If the Buyer and the Seller are unable to resolve the issue directly, the Buyer or the Seller can escalate the issue to VINTED by contacting VINTED’s Customer Support from their Private Message. After VINTED has reviewed the issue, if VINTED agrees that the Item indeed does not substantially comply with the description provided by the Seller in the Item listing or that the item was damaged during transit, VINTED will cancel the Transaction and instruct ADYEN N.V. to issue a refund to the Buyer after the Buyer confirms that the Item has been shipped back to the Seller. VINTED does not provide return shipping services. Shipping costs for returning an Item are the responsibility of the Buyer, unless the Buyer and the Seller agree otherwise. If the Buyer does not send the Item back within the period stipulated by VINTED, the Buyer may not be eligible to receive a refund under [Buyer Protection](https://www.vinted.fr/help/550-buyer-protection?access_channel=hc_search). If VINTED determines that there are strong indications that the received Item is a counterfeit, then VINTED may decide, in its sole discretion, that the Buyer does not need to send back the Item in order to get a refund and the Buyer and the Seller will respect such decision.

(iii) If the Buyer and the Seller resolve the issue privately after having already contacted VINTED’s Customer Support, the Users must inform VINTED (by contacting VINTED’s Customer Support) that the issue has been resolved.

(iv) With respect to an Item that a Buyer has reported is significantly not as described in the Item’s listing, if VINTED determines that the Item complies with the description provided by the Seller in the Item listing, then the Buyer shall not be eligible for a refund through VINTED and VINTED will direct ADYEN N.V. to complete the Transaction in accordance with Section 6.4. After the Transaction is completed and the money in escrow is released to the Seller, the Buyer can try to negotiate directly with the Seller for the return of the Item (e.g., agreement on reimbursement, return shipping fees, etc.); however, the Seller may refuse to cooperate with the Buyer on the grounds that the Transaction has been fulfilled from the Seller side.

5.3.3 **No Refund.** If there is something wrong with the Item received by the Buyer or the Item was not received by the Buyer but:

(i) the Buyer does not click the “I have an issue” button within the Dispute Filing Period; or

(ii) the Buyer confirmed that the Item is acceptable (by clicking the “Everything is ok” button in the Private Message)

the Transaction will be completed automatically and the Buyer will not be entitled to a refund under Buyer Protection for that Item and the money that the Seller is entitled to for the Transaction will be released by ADYEN N.V. to the Seller. 

5.4 **Not Insurance.** Buyer Protection is not insurance services or legal protection guarantee services.

5.5 **Acknowledgment that VINTED Makes Final Decisions.** Users agree to comply with the process for receiving a refund under Buyer Protection and to permit VINTED to make the final decision on any Buyer Protection-related issue.

5.6 **Refunds for Bundles.** 

5.6.1 **Bundles Lost During Shipping.** If the Buyer purchased a Bundle and the bundled Items are lost during shipment, then the Buyer should follow the Buyer Protection process in Section 5.3.1.

5.6.2 **Bundles With Damaged Items or Significantly Not As Described** **Items**. If the Buyer purchased a Bundle and the Buyer considers any of the Items in the Bundle as damaged during shipment or significantly not as described in the Item’s listing, then the Buyer should follow the Buyer Protection process in Section 5.3.2. If the Buyer chooses to return any of the Items in the Bundle, then the Buyer must return all Items in the Bundle (i.e., not just the damaged/misdescribed Items). Shipping costs for returning a Bundle are the responsibility of the Buyer, unless the Buyer and the Seller agree otherwise. The refund under Buyer Protection will be issued for all Items in the Bundle (i.e., not just the damaged/misdescribed Items). 

6.  **INTEGRATED PAYMENT SERVICE** 

6.1 **Calculating the Total Price.** Integrated Payment Service enables the Buyer to pay in advance the total amount due for the Transaction, which consists of: 

(i) the price for the Item(s) purchased from the Seller; 

(ii) the Shipping fees;

(iii) the Buyer Protection fee; and

(iv) any applicable taxes

(collectively, (i)-(iv), the “**Total Price**”).

6.2 **Payment Methods.** Payment for the Total Price can be made by credit or debit card or any other payment method introduced from time to time on the Site. If a credit or debit card or other payment method that is suspected to belong to a third person is provided by a User on the Site, the User may be required to provide additional proof that a credit or debit card or other payment method does belong to a User (the same applies for Paying for Additional Services as described below). If the Buyer has funds available on the e-wallet (Balance), such funds will be automatically used to make purchases on the Site from other Users. If the Buyer does not have enough funds in their e-wallet to cover the total amount due, Buyer can cover the missing portion by paying through other available payment methods.

6.3 **Paying for Additional Services.** To pay for Additional Services, the User must provide their credit or debit card information or necessary details for any other payment method available on the Site. 

6.4 **Completion of a Transaction.** The Total Price paid by the Buyer in advance will be retained by ADYEN N.V. in escrow until a Transaction is completed. A Transaction is considered complete:

(i) when the Buyer confirms through the Site that the delivered Item(s) complies with the conditions of the offer by clicking “Everything is ok”; or

(ii) automatically after the expiration of the Dispute Filing Period if no disputes about the Item(s) are reported during the Dispute Filing Period; or 

(iii) after the resolution of a dispute that was reported during the Dispute Filing Period. 

Once a Transaction is completed, the purchase price of the Item, and if the Custom Shipping option was used (as described in Section 7.1), also the shipping fees, will be immediately transferred by ADYEN N.V. to the Seller’s e-wallet. At any time, a User can elect to have the funds available in a User’s e-wallet transferred by ADYEN N.V. to the User’s personal bank account without any transfer fee; however, for the first pay-out, a User must provide bank account details as described in Section 6.5.1 below. Please also review Section 6.5.1 below for the limitations which may apply for the pay-outs.

6.5 **E-Wallet.** 

6.5.1 **Setting Up E-Wallet.** E-wallet (Balance) feature is a payment service provided by ADYEN N.V. When a User opens the e-wallet, the User enters into a contract directly with ADYEN N.V., and the User will be accepting ADYEN N.V. [terms and conditions](https://www.adyen.com/legal/terms-and-conditions). Users will be asked to confirm this during e-wallet creation. For the first sale Transaction where the Buyer purchases an Item using the “Buy now” button, the Seller will be asked to open e-wallet by providing the Seller’s name, surname, date of birth, SSN number, address, and phone number (if required). If the Seller fails to do so in 5 days, the sale Transaction will be canceled. Before the first sale Transaction takes place, Sellers can also open the e-wallet on their own initiative by going to their account’s settings (Select “Balance”, then press “Activate Balance”) and providing required data. 

Once the e-wallet confirmation is completed and the e-wallet is opened, Users will be subject to regulatory procedures applied by ADYEN N.V. such as identity check and other requirements of the “Know Your Customer” (KYC) procedure when respective thresholds (which are set by ADYEN N.V.) are met. In addition, ADYEN N.V. may, at its sole discretion, apply lower KYC thresholds to a particular user in case of suspected fraudulent or suspicious behavior. If a User fails to comply with the KYC requirements, the User’s e-wallet may be suspended and the User will not be able to pay out or reach the funds until User’s identity is successfully confirmed. If a User uploaded a fraudulent document or took any other action and ADYEN N.V. deemed such User as fraudulent, they will no longer be able to overcome KYC check again and Users funds will remain restricted.

After a User confirms the User’s e-wallet and makes a successful sale for the first time, the User will be able to transfer amounts from the User’s e-wallet to the User’s bank account, the transfer will be performed by ADYEN N.V. To enable this option, the User must first go to User account settings and add the User’s bank account number, full name and billing address. Afterward the user will be able to make pay-outs to his/ her bank account freely. However, if a user reaches the KYC thresholds (which are set by ADYEN N.V.) or during transaction monitoring suspicious activity is caught by ADYEN N.V. and KYC is triggered, the pay-outs option will be stopped too, until the user successfully finishes KYC procedure.

6.6 **ADYEN N.V.** VINTED contracts with ADYEN N.V. to process payments made using the Integrated Payment Service and store information relating to the credit cards, debit cards, and any other payment method offered on the Site. Additionally, ADYEN N.V. provides escrow services--when a Buyer makes a purchase by using the “Buy now” button, ADYEN N.V. acquires funds from the Buyer on behalf of the Seller and holds those funds for disbursement. VINTED supports its Users in using the services provided by ADYEN N.V. and provides direct assistance to Users for such services; however, to avoid doubt, VINTED does not provide any payment processing or money transmission services for Users. Users are solely responsible for providing accurate information associated with credit cards, debit cards, and any other payment method offered on the Site and VINTED hereby disclaims any responsibility and all liability for User-provided information to the full extent permitted by applicable law.

6.7 **Additional Integrated Payment Service Restrictions.** 

6.7.1 **No Third-Party Use.** The right to use the Integrated Payment Service is only for sales in a User’s own name. A User may not resell, hire, or on any other basis allow third parties to use the Integrated Payment Service to enable such third parties to be paid for their services. 

6.7.2 **Permitted Items Only.** The Integrated Payment Service is only for Items on the Site and not for any other products or services. Users may use the Integrated Payment Service only for Items that comply with the Catalog Rules and that are not on ADYEN N.V.'s [List of Prohibited Products and Services](https://www.adyen.com/legal/list-restricted-prohibited). 

6.8 **Suspension.** VINTED retains the right to suspend your right to use the Integrated Payment Service and other Services, as further described below.

6.8.1 **Inaccurate Information.** If VINTED at any time discovers that any information a User provides about himself/herself is incorrect or has changed without the User informing VINTED, VINTED may immediately suspend the User’s Account (including any in-progress transactions).

6.8.2 **Suspected Fraud.** If there are consistent and objective reasons to suspect that a fraud of any kind whatsoever has been committed or carried out by a User, VINTED may immediately suspend the User’s Account while the suspected fraud is investigated (including any in-progress transactions).

6.8.3 **Problems Reported by ADYEN N.V..** In the event ADYEN N.V. reports any issues or concerns to VINTED (such as suspected illegal sales on the Site, money laundering, spamming, violation of ADYEN N.V.’s [terms and conditions](https://www.adyen.com/legal/terms-and-conditions)), VINTED may immediately suspend the User’s Account (including any in-progress transactions) while the issue or concern is investigated.

6.8.4 **User-Initiated Dispute.** If any User initiates a dispute resolution procedure in relation to a Transaction via an external payment service provider and there are objective and legitimate reasons to believe that the User has violated applicable laws, breached these Terms and/or misused the Site, VINTED may immediately suspend the User’s Account (including any in-progress transactions).

7.  **INTEGRATED SHIPPING SERVICE**

7.1 **Integrated Shipping Service Overview.** Except as stated below**,** the Integrated Shipping Service is applied to every Transaction concluded using the “Buy now” button. The Buyer will pay for the Integrated Shipping Service at Checkout and the Integrated Shipping Service fee will be held in Seller’s e-wallet in escrow. As further described below, the Integrated Shipping Service includes Integrated Shipping Labels and the Custom Shipping option. Items regulated as hazardous materials are not eligible for the Integrated Shipping Service and must be shipped using the Custom Shipping option. Please refer to Vinted’s Catalog Rules for additional information regarding hazardous materials.

7.2 **Shipping Options.** Certain shipping options are enabled by default for Sellers and cannot be turned off. Users are responsible for reviewing and agreeing to all applicable terms and conditions of the shipping provider the User selects. The Seller may choose Integrated Shipping Labels or Custom Shipping (as further described below).

**(1) Integrated Shipping Label.** If the Seller decides to ship an Item using Integrated Shipping, (i), during Checkout, the Buyer will be able to choose from the shipping providers available within their area (available options will be provided on the Item page) and (ii), after Checkout, a pre-paid shipping label will be automatically generated and provided to the Seller who must use that label to send the Item to the Buyer (the “**Integrated Shipping Label**”). The Seller must use the Integrated Shipping Label provided by VINTED; otherwise the Transaction may be canceled. Once the Transaction is completed (as per Section 6.4), the price of the Item will be released from escrow to the Seller and the Buyer Protection fee and the fee for the Integrated Shipping Service (and any applicable taxes charged on Services) will be released from escrow to VINTED. 

For its Integrated Shipping Labels option, VINTED offers its Users a choice of third-party shipping providers specializing in transport and delivery. VINTED may at any time add or remove shipping providers from the list of options available to Users. 

With Integrated Shipping, if an Item is lost or damaged during the shipping process, the Buyer is eligible to be reimbursed as part of Buyer Protection as described in Section 5. 

The Seller may be entitled to compensation for a lost or damaged Item up to the compensation limit set by each shipping provider. 

The following shipping providers are available: 

**United States Postal Services (USPS)**

Users who select USPS as their shipping provider agree to comply with all applicable [USPS terms and conditions](https://pe.usps.com/DMM300). 

If an Item that a Seller sends via USPS is lost or damaged in the shipping process, the Seller may be entitled to receive compensation as follows:

(a) for **small packages**, Seller is eligible for a refund of up to $100 per package. Such refund is to be compensated directly by ADYEN N.V to the Seller after receiving a request from VINTED. 

(b) for **medium and large packages**, Seller is eligible for a refund of up to $100 per package; the Seller will have to directly [claim this compensation from USPS](https://pe.usps.com/text/dmm300/609.htm#ep1097134). Information about compensation can be found on the [USPS website](https://pe.usps.com/text/dmm300/503.htm#ep1063624).

Integrated Shipping Label option is not available for Items in some categories. 

(2) Custom Shipping. If the Seller decides to independently ship an Item (i.e., without using an Integrated Shipping Label) or is shipping hazardous materials, the Seller will be responsible for choosing the shipping provider, determining the postage price, and arranging for the label and shipping the Item. The Seller is responsible for estimating a correct and accurate postage price and identifying it in the listing. The Seller must use a shipping provider with tracking enabled. The Seller must, in particular, note down the tracking number for the shipment and send it to the Buyer via a Private Message. 

If any Item that is sent by Custom Shipping is lost or damaged in the shipping process:

(i) If the Buyer chooses Custom Shipping offered by the Seller and the Buyer purchases the Item using the “Buy now” button, the Buyer will be reimbursed by VINTED as part of the Buyer Protection as described in Section 5.

(ii) The Seller accepts the risks of shipping when using Custom Shipping. VINTED will not offer any compensation to the Seller and the Seller will have to reach out to the shipping provider directly regarding any problems in connection with shipping. The Seller therefore should consider insuring Items shipped using a Custom Shipping option in the event the Item is lost or damaged. 

7.3 **Responsibility For Fees.** The costs (excluding any applicable taxes) for the available Integrated Shipping Services (“**Shipping Fees**”) are shown after clicking on an Item in the Catalog on the Item Page. The Shipping Fees (plus any applicable taxes in case of Integrated Shipping Label) are the responsibility of the Buyer, in addition to the purchase price for the Item, the Buyer Protection fee, and applicable taxes.

7.4 **Commitment to Ship.** As soon as the Buyer has paid the Total Price, VINTED informs the Seller that the item was sold and should be shipped to the Seller. The Seller is responsible for shipping out the Item to the Buyer within five (5) working days after VINTED provides shipping instructions. If the Seller does not ship the Item within such a 5-day period, VINTED has the right to cancel the Transaction and direct ADYEN N.V. to release the Total Price held in escrow to the Buyer. This refund of the Total Price will constitute the Buyer’s only recourse under their contract with the Seller and these Terms and will be the Buyer’s sole remedy for the canceled Transaction.

7.5 **Availability of Integrated Shipping Services.** Integrated Shipping Services are available only in some states or regions. If Integrated Shipping Services are unavailable, the Seller and the Buyer must agree on one of the other shipping methods.

8.  **PAYING FOR ITEMS** 

8.1 [**Price List.**](https://.vinted.com/pricelist) VINTED is authorized to collect fees for the Services in accordance with the prices indicated in the [Price List](https://www.vinted.co.uk/pricelist). In its sole discretion, VINTED may update the Price List from time to time (and updates may include price changes) as per Section 1.5 of these Terms. Price List changes will not apply to ongoing Transactions (i.e., Transactions for which a Buyer has already made a payment). The updated Price List shall become effective and replace the prior Price List at the time of posting or such other time as may be indicated by VINTED. If you do not agree with or accept the updated Price List, you can choose to not access and use the Site, to terminate your relationship with VINTED, and to close your User account (as further described in Section 16.1). You will be deemed to have accepted the updated Price List if you continue to access and use the Site after the updated Price List becomes effective; however, Price List changes will not apply to ongoing Transactions (i.e., Transactions for which a Buyer has already made a payment).

8.2 **Currency; Taxes.** All prices on the Site are expressed in United States Dollars (USD) and do not include applicable taxes. The final amount of applicable taxes will be shown to the User during Checkout.

9.  **INTERACTION AND MESSAGES ON THE SITE**

9.1 **Private messages.**

The exchange of Private Messages between Users is for the purpose of exchanging information between Users regarding the Items in the Catalog. If a User sends Private Messages to another User, **they must not send**:

1.  messages or information that feature advertising;
2.  content spreading viruses, worms, or other malicious codes;
3.  spam or mass mailing messages of any kind (e.g., when a message is sent to more than five Users simultaneously or when the same message is copied and sent to Users who have not asked to receive the message);
4.  messages containing content contrary to good moral standards and public order; inappropriate, insulting or defamatory messages; or messages otherwise regarded as incompatible with these Terms and the interests of Users;
5.  messages of an unlawful nature or otherwise intended to cause harm to other Users and/or the Site; or
6.  messages that may qualify as harassment of any kind whatsoever.

VINTED may use automated software that is designed to use algorithms to detect contents of Private Messages that are contrary to good moral standards and public order or that are inappropriate, insulting, or defamatory. If the automated software detects a Private Message containing any such content, without limiting other remedies available to VINTED, (i) the Private Message and User may be blocked and/or the Private Message may be hidden from the User to whom it was sent and (ii) the User who sent such Private Message may receive a warning reminding the User of their obligation to comply with these Terms and informing the User that VINTED may take further steps such as suspending the User's Account in case of further violations. VINTED’s use of such automated software does not create a monitoring obligation on VINTED nor an obligation to actively search for unlawful activities and/or content on the Site and, to the extent permitted by the applicable law, does not give rise to any liability on VINTED. 

9.2 **User Reviews.**

A User has the right to write a review concerning another User only if a Transaction was completed between the Users. The review may be published on the Site. No compensation is given to Users or to VINTED in exchange for online reviews. A User’s review on another User must always be fair and honest. Lies and insults are forbidden. VINTED does not check reviews prior to publication on the Site by Users.

If any review that has been published on the Site is inappropriate or abusive or otherwise does not comply with these Terms, Users may report the review to VINTED in accordance with the reporting procedure described in Section 10.5 below. Upon request of a User, VINTED has the right, but is not obligated to, remove from the Site any review that violates these Terms or the rights of other Users. Additionally, VINTED may block the account of any User who provides a review that does not comply with these Terms as outlined in Section 12.1. 

Only Users may write and post reviews on the Site. Visitors do not have the right to write and post reviews on the Site.

9.3 **Forum.** Both Users and Visitors may consult the Forum, but only Users may post messages to the Forum. Before using the Forum, each User and Visitor must read the Forum Rules.

Users and Visitors are responsible for the messages they post in the Forum, and Users and Visitors should not share any confidential or private information in the Forum. VINTED is not responsible for Content in the Forum (or for what Users and Visitors do with such Content). VINTED is not responsible if the identity of a User who has posted a message or a topic in the Forum is made public.

VINTED will also cooperate with local authorities if required. In the event that a User or a Visitor does not comply with Section 10.2 or otherwise violates these Terms, the User or the Visitor recognizes and accepts that they are solely responsible for any and all resulting direct and indirect losses of third parties or VINTED. Consequently, the User or the Visitor recognizes and accepts that, in its capacity as a hosting provider, VINTED will under no circumstances undertake any verification of the Content and the Items listed in the Catalog, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, will under no circumstances be held responsible for any damages or losses suffered by Visitors or Users and/or third parties. In particular, without this list being exhaustive, VINTED will not be held responsible for: (i) actions or omissions of Visitors or Users; (ii) the appropriateness, accuracy, exhaustiveness, and/or legality of any Content; or (iii) the safety, quality, and quantity of Items that Users sell, buy, exchange, or donate via the Site nor the conformance of an Item with the description given.

12.6 **Determination of Breach.** VINTED has the sole right to determine whether a User or Visitor breaches these Terms.

12.7 **Taxes.** With the help of a third-party provider, VINTED will automatically calculate, collect and remit to the appropriate Department of Revenue the applicable sales tax on the Item sold in a certain US jurisdiction, but only if (i) the Seller’s Item has been sold on the Site using Integrated Payment Service and (ii) VINTED is liable to collect and remit sales tax in the respective US jurisdiction.

In accordance with local US tax laws, applicable sales tax will be calculated taking into account a number of factors, such as type and price of the Item and/or Service purchased, where the Item is being shipped from and to, etc. The final sales tax amount applicable to the Item and/or Service purchased will be shown to the User during Checkout.

Promotions may be subject to certain eligibility requirements, determined by Vinted.

When a User has a Holiday status, Items listed by such User will be hidden from other Users. Additionally, VINTED reserves the right to remove Items listed by any User if such Items were not sold (or exchanged or donated) for a substantially long period of time. Prior to the application of Holiday status and/or the removal of any Items, VINTED will send a notice to the User. Such notification will inform the User of the upcoming change to the User’s status and/or listed Items and allow the User to reject such change (provided that the User is not otherwise in violation of these Terms). The User will need to inform VINTED of its rejection of the change within the notification period stated in the notice.
