_Joint Controllership with Facebook („page insights”)_

Vinted operates a so-called fan page on the social media platform of Facebook. Facebook and Vinted are only jointly responsible for the processing of so-called "insights data" (Art. 26 (1) sentence 1 of the GDPR) insofar as this data is used for the creation of so-called "page insights" and only for the phases of the collection of data from Vinted's fan page until the transmission to Facebook. For other data processing, Vinted and Facebook are separately responsible for data processing.

Within the scope of their joint controllership, Vinted and Facebook have entered into an agreement (so-called "[page insights controller addendum](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/page_controller_addendum)"). The agreement covers the data processing that is collected and used in connection with a visit or interaction with our fan page, but only to the extent that this data is also (subsequently) processed for "page insights". "Page insights" includes analysis services that help us to better understand interactions on our site. In this context, we do not receive any personal data from Facebook, but only an anonymous evaluation and illustration. Facebook provides more information on this on [its help page for "page insights"](https://de-de.facebook.com/help/pages/insights). The [information about data for "page insights"](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/information_about_page_insights_data) explains how "insights data" is collected and used to create "page insights". This includes the following actions:

1.  Views and interactions with a page, post, video, story, or other content associated with a page;
2.  Subscribing or unsubscribing to a page;
3.  Reactions to a page or a contribution (e.g. "like"; recommendation, share, comment, subscribe etc.);
4.  Hiding a page contribution or report it as spam;
5.  Moving the mouse over a link to a page or the name or profile picture of a page to see a preview of the page contents;
6.  Clicks on the website, phone number, "route planning" button or any other button on a page;
7.  Views of an event of a page, reactions to an event (including the type of reaction), clicks on a link for event tickets;
8.  Starting a messenger conversation with the page;
9.  Views or clicks on articles in a website shop;
10.  IP address as well as other information that is available on your end device in the form of cookies.

The processing of the data of the visitors of our fan page serves the purpose of providing the page as well as the statistical evaluation of the use of our page. This evaluation is made anonymous for Vinted. The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1)(f) of the GDPR. Our legitimate interests in the processing of personal data when visiting the site and the creation of the "site insights" consist of presenting the company and the Platform and, for example, contacting members and interested parties and providing information about products and promotions, as well as the collection of data for the creation of anonymous evaluations and illustrations about the use of our fan page.

If you wish to exercise your rights regarding your data (see bullet point 6. below), it would certainly be more effective for you to contact Facebook directly. If you still need help in exercising your rights, you can contact us. In accordance with our agreement, Facebook assumes primary responsibility for fulfilling the obligations for the joint processing of "insights data". This includes fulfilling the following rights:

\- The right to access (Art. 15 of the GDPR);

\- The right to ratification (Art. 17 of the GDPR);

\- The right to restrict processing (Art. 18 of the GDPR);

\- The right to data portability (Art. 20 of the GDPR); and

\- The right of objection (Art. 21 of the GDPR).

Facebook provides more details on how to exercise these rights in the ["page insights data" information](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/information_about_page_insights_data).
