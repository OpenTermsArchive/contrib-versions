1\. General
===========

This Privacy Policy applies to the online platform Vinted (“Website”) and to the associated app (“App”) (the Website and the App are jointly referred to as the “Platform”) intended for United States users.

The Platform is operated by Vinted Inc., a company registered in Delaware, with business location at C/o AG Accounting 735 Geary St. #303 San Francisco, CA 94109. The operator is further referred to as “We”, “Us” or “Vinted”. More details about how to get in contact with us can be found at the end of this Privacy Policy under No. 7.

We take your privacy extremely seriously. All personal data will be collected, stored and used by us in accordance with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation No. 2016/679 (“GDPR”) and/or other applicable statutory regulations.

If you are a California resident, please see our [California Privacy Policy](#ccpa-notice).

The services offered by us via the Website and/or App can function only if we collect, store, transfer, delete and/or otherwise use (“collect and use”) specific data relating to you (“personal data” or “data”). Personal data means all information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person such as your name, date of birth, address, or email address.

This Privacy Policy describes what type of data we collect from you and for what purposes we collect and use it when you use the services offered by Us on the Platform. This Privacy Policy also contains important information on the protection of your data, especially the statutory rights you have in connection with it.

Certain services on our Platform are offered by third-party suppliers. When you use these services, the data protection regulations that govern third-party suppliers will then apply in addition to this data protection statement. Prior to your use of such services, the third-party suppliers may require you to provide permission under the data protection law.

Under applicable data protection laws, Vinted is obligated to inform you about data processing and Vinted fulfills this obligation within this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy and any parts of it are not meant as contractual clauses and do not form part of the [general terms and conditions](https://www.vinted.com/terms-and-conditions) (“GTC”) as a contract that is concluded with registered users. Under applicable data protection laws, Vinted can process data that is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract with you or necessary for taking steps at your request prior to entering into a contract (Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR). References to the GTC should always be understood as information on data processing (Art. 13 and 14 GDPR) and never as clauses that form part of the GTC. By using the Platform and our services, you enter into a legally binding contract between you and Vinted, the conditions of which are described in the GTC.

 

2\. Why and how do we collect and use your personal data?
=========================================================

2.1. To enable you to use the Platform, allow us to provide our services and perform our GTC

We collect and use your personal data to allow you to use our Platform, to provide our services and to fulfill a contract (GTC) with you and above all, to carry out commercial transactions via the Platform, to use the electronic payment system or to leave reviews and communicate with other members. To use these services, you need a Vinted account. For this purpose, you must register as a member on the Website or App.
