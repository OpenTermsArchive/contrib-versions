_Joint Controllership with Facebook (“page insights”)_

Vinted operates a so-called fan page on the social media platform of Facebook. Facebook and Vinted are only jointly responsible for the processing of so-called "insights data" (Art. 26 (1) sentence 1 of the GDPR) insofar as this data is used for the creation of so-called "page insights" and only for the data collection phases from Vinted's fan page until its transmission to Facebook. For other data processing, Vinted and Facebook are separately responsible for data processing.

Within the scope of their joint controllership, Vinted and Facebook have entered into an agreement (referred to as the "[page insights controller addendum](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/page_controller_addendum)"). The agreement covers the data processing that is collected and used in connection with a visit or interaction with our fan page, but only to the extent that this data is also (subsequently) processed for "page insights". "Page insights" includes analysis services that help us to better understand interactions on our site. In this context, we do not receive any personal data from Facebook, only an anonymous evaluation and illustration. Facebook provides more information on this on [its help page for "page insights"](https://de-de.facebook.com/help/pages/insights). The [information about data for "page insights"](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/information_about_page_insights_data) explains how "insights data" is collected and used to create "page insights". This includes the following actions:

1.  Views and interactions with a page, post, video, story, or other content associated with a page;
2.  Subscribing or unsubscribing to a page;
3.  Reactions to a page or a contribution (e.g., a "like"; recommendation, share, comment, subscription, etc.);
4.  Hiding a page contribution or reporting it as spam;
5.  Moving the mouse over a link to a page or the name or profile picture of a page to see a preview of the page contents;
6.  Clicks on the website, phone number, "route planning" button or any other button on a page;
7.  Views of an event of a page, reactions to an event (including the type of reaction), clicks on a link for event tickets;
8.  Starting a messenger conversation with the page;
9.  Views or clicks on articles in a website shop;
10.  IP address as well as other information that is available on your end device in the form of cookies.

The processing of visitor data from our fan page serves the purpose of providing the page as well as the statistical evaluation of the use of our page. This evaluation is made anonymous for Vinted.  The legal grounds for data processing are Art. 6 (1)(f) of the GDPR. Our legitimate interests in the processing of personal data when visiting the site and the creation of "site insights" consist of presenting the company and the Platform. Similarly, we also seek to contact members and interested parties in order to provide information on products and promotions, as well as for the collection of data in order to generate anonymous evaluations and illustrations on the use of our fan page.

If you wish to exercise your rights with respect to your data (see bullet point 6. below), contacting Facebook directly is the most effective way. You can contact us if you still need help in exercising your rights. In accordance with our agreement, Facebook assumes primary responsibility for fulfilling the obligations for the joint processing of "insights data". This includes fulfilling the following rights:

*   The right to access (Art. 15 of the GDPR);
*   The right to ratification (Art. 17 of the GDPR);
*   The right to restrict processing (Art. 18 of the GDPR);
*   The right to data portability (Art. 20 of the GDPR); and
*   The right of objection (Art. 21 of the GDPR).

Facebook provides more details on how to exercise these rights in the ["page insights data" information](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/information_about_page_insights_data).  
  
_Joint Controllership with LinkedIn_

Vinted operates a so-called company page on LinkedIn, the social media platform. LinkedIn and Vinted are only jointly responsible (Art. 26 (1) sentence 1 of the GDPR) for the processing of so-called "insights data", enabling us to receive anonymized statistics and insights on how visitors interact with our page. For other data processing, Vinted and LinkedIn are separately responsible for data processing.

Within the scope of the joint controllership, Vinted and LinkedIn have entered into an agreement (referred to as the "Page Insights Joint Controller Addendum") in which the data protection obligations are allocated between LinkedIn and Vinted. The agreement stipulates the following:

*   LinkedIn is responsible for enabling you to exercise your rights pursuant to the GDPR. In order to do so, you can contact LinkedIn online via https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/ask/PPQ?lang=de or via the contact information in the data protection guidelines. You can contact LinkedIn Ireland’s Data Protection Officer via the following link: https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/ask/TSO-DPO. You can also reach out to us using the contact information mentioned below to exercise your rights with respect to the processing of your personal data for insights. In such a case, we will forward your request to LinkedIn.
*   LinkedIn and Vinted have agreed that the Irish Data Protection Commission shall be the responsible supervisory authority monitoring the processing for insights. You always have the right to lodge a complaint with the Irish Data Protection Commission (see www.dataprotection.ie) or any other supervisory authority.

The data processing of LinkedIn company page visitors serves to provide the page itself as well as the statistical evaluation of the use of our page. This evaluation is made anonymous for Vinted (LinkedIn does not share personal data with us when providing us with the insights, we only have access to a summarized version of the insights; also, we are unable to make conclusions about individual members based on information in the insights). The legal grounds for the processing of your personal data  is Art. 6 (1)(f) of the GDPR. Our legitimate interests in the processing of personal data when visiting the site and the creation of the "insights" include the presentation of the company and the Platform. Similarly, we also seek to contact members and interested parties to provide information about products and promotions, as well as to collect data for the creation of anonymous evaluations and illustrations on the use of our company page.

The CCPA provides California consumers with certain rights regarding their personal information. This Section explains those rights. If you are a California consumer and would like to exercise any of those rights, please see below (How to Submit a Request) below for more information on how to submit a request.

**1\. Right to know about and access your personal information**
----------------------------------------------------------------

If you are a California consumer, you may have the right to request that Vinted provide you with information regarding what personal information about you we have collected, used, disclosed or sold in the preceding twelve (12) months. Once we receive your request and verify your identity, we will disclose to you the following:

**2\. Right to delete your personal information**

If you are a California consumer, you may have the right to request that Vinted delete a portion of your personal information that we have collected from you. However, this right to deletion does not apply to any of your personal information that is subject to an exception under the CCPA (as described below). Once we receive your request and verify your identity, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) any of your personal information in our records that is not subject to any of the CCPA exceptions. Specifically, we may deny your deletion request if your personal information is required for any of the following reasons, which we will identify in our response to you if we deny your request:

*   Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.
*   To be able to fulfill the terms of a written warranty or product recall conducted in accordance with federal law.
*   Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.
*   Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
*   Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.
*   Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 seq.).
*   Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.
*   Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with your expectations based on your relationship with Us.
*   Comply with a legal obligation.
*   Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.

**3\. Right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information**
-----------------------------------------------------------------

If you are a California consumer, you may have the right to request that Vinted stop selling some or all your personal information. Once we receive your request and verify your identity, we will process your request as soon as feasibly possible and will also provide notification of your request to any third parties to whom we sold your personal information in the ninety (90) days prior to your request. You may also use an authorized agent to submit a request to opt-out on your behalf, as long as you provide the authorized agent with written permission to do so, and the agent provides such proof to Us when they submit your request. 

**4\. Right to non-discrimination**
-----------------------------------

You have the right to not receive discriminatory treatment for the exercise of the privacy rights conferred by the CCPA.

**5\. How to submit a request**
-------------------------------

If you are a California consumer and would like to exercise any of the CCPA rights identified above, you may submit a request by emailing Us at [dpo@vinted.com](mailto:dpo@vinted.com). You can also exercise your right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information by clicking this link.

**6\. Submitting a request through your authorized agent**
----------------------------------------------------------

If you are a California consumer, you may have the option to designate an authorized agent to submit a request on your behalf, so long the authorized agent has your written permission to do so and you have taken steps to verify your identity directly with Us. If you would like to designate an agent, your agent must register as such with the California Secretary of State and submit a copy of this registration along with your consumer request to Us. We may need to contact you directly to verify the request.

**7\. How we verify your request**
----------------------------------

We cannot fulfill your request to delete or to know and access your personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with Us.

To verify your identity, we may ask that you provide the following personal information when you submit your request:

*   Full name;
*   Username;
*   Email address.

You may need to provide additional information as part of your responses to our identity verification questions. We will only use this information to confirm your identity.  Depending on your type of request or the information requested by you, we may require additional information in order to verify your identity and fulfill your request.

If we cannot successfully verify your identity, we will inform you of that fact.

We will respond to your request within forty-five (45) days. However, in certain circumstances, we may require additional time to process your request, as permitted by the CCPA or other applicable law. We will advise you within forty-five (45) days after receiving your request if such an extension is necessary and why it is needed. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your verifiable consumer request.

If we cannot fulfill your request, our response to you will also explain the reason why we cannot fulfill your request.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

You may only make a verifiable consumer request to know about or access your personal information twice within a twelve-month period.
