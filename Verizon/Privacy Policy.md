    The types of information we collect depends on your use of our products and services and [the ways that you interact with us](#). This may include information about:
    
    the ways that you interact with us
    
    You may interact with us in a variety of ways, for example, when you place an order or have questions about your account or services;  enter a Verizon-sponsored or affiliated contest, sweepstakes or promotion; or register to receive news or public policy updates.

We may use artificial intelligence guided by humans, such as chat bots, to respond to your inquiry. When you interact with us through third-party services like Facebook Messenger or Twitter Direct Message, your communications are also governed by these companies’ privacy policies.
    
    *   [Contact, billing and other information you provide](#)
    *   [How you use our services and your devices](#)
    *   [How you use our websites and apps](#)

    Some Verizon wireless devices include system applications we provide to:
    
    *   collect information about network and device conditions including location, battery life and applications on the device.
    *   automatically install apps when you activate your device and with your consent at later times, for example, when you request an app from an advertisement or over the phone.

You can use your device app controls to disable notifications from Verizon App Manager to opt out of these messages.
    
    Some apps installed or updated on your device in this way do not appear as icons on your device screen because of their limited utility. For example, they might facilitate the download of apps you select for your device, update apps you already have on your device, or report to an app owner that an app has been opened on the device. You can see and also delete or disable apps installed on your device, whether or not they have visible icons, using your device’s Application Manager under Settings. Apps on your device are governed by their own terms and privacy policies.

    ### Cookies, social media plug-ins and other website and app tools.
    
    You may see third-party advertisements on Verizon websites, services, apps and devices and see Verizon ads on others’ sites, services, apps and devices. These ads may be tailored for you based on information that we or [companies](#) acting on our behalf collect on Verizon sites and apps as well as from other sites and apps where these advertising entities also are present.
    
    companies
    
    For example, ad servers, ad networks or technology platforms including Verizon Media. We may deliver Verizon marketing on our websites and apps and on non-Verizon websites and apps, by our representatives, via mail or email or via other Verizon services or devices.  
    
    To accomplish this type of advertising, advertising entities place and access [cookies and similar technologies](https://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/cookies) on browsers you use and access advertising identifiers from your mobile device operating systems. Information about your activities on the websites and in the apps where the entities are present is combined and used to determine whether you fall into an audience advertisers wish to reach.
    
    Advertising that is customized based on information about your visits over time and across different websites, apps and devices is known as "interest-based" advertising. In accordance with [industry self-regulatory principles](#), we require that advertising companies disclose when they are using interest-based advertising techniques to deliver interest-based ads on our sites and apps as well as when they deliver Verizon ads on other sites. We also require them to offer you an [ability to opt out](http://www.aboutads.info/) of this use of your information. 
    
    industry self-regulatory principles
    
    For example, the [Digital Advertising Alliance](https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/) enforces responsible privacy practices for users and providers of interest-based advertising. These practices include offering enhanced transparency and control to consumers.  
    
    You can visit the industry-wide [Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out page](https://www.aboutads.info/) to learn more and opt-out. Alternatively, you will see an [icon](#) ad choices icon in or around online advertisements placed using interest-based advertising techniques. You can click on the icon to learn more and opt out. Similarly, you can opt out of this type of advertising on your mobile device by going to settings and selecting "Limit Ad Tracking" or "Opt out of Interest-Based Ads.”
    
    icon
    
    A click on this icon provides additional information about the companies and data practices used to deliver the ad and guidance about how you can opt out of this type of advertising.  
    
    Verizon websites and services may include social network or other third-party plug-ins and widgets that may provide information to their associated social networks or third parties even if you do not click on or otherwise interact with the plug-ins and widgets.
    
    We may also permit advertisers on our sites, apps and services to place ads based on certain information we have about your Verizon products and services, as well as geographic and demographic data. This information is not shared externally.
    
    ### We also use de-identified and aggregated information.
    
    We may de-identify or aggregate information so that Verizon or others may use it for business and marketing purposes. For example, the data we aggregate might be used to analyze, personalize and improve our services, to provide business and marketing insights to others and to help make advertising more relevant to you. [You have choices](#) about some of these uses.
    
    You have choices
    
    For example, you can opt out of our advertising and insights programs. [Go to choices](https://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/full-privacy-policy#acc-item-34).

    We share information within Verizon for a variety of purposes, including providing you with the latest information about our products and services and offering you our latest promotions. You can limit the sharing of [Customer Proprietary Network Information](#) and [certain credit information](#) if you do not want us to use them to market services to you that are different from the ones you have.
    
    Customer Proprietary Network Information
    
    Customer Proprietary Network Information (or CPNI) is information that relates to the type, quantity, destination, technical configuration, location, amount of use and related billing information of your telecommunications or interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services. Federal law governs our use and sharing of CPNI.  
    
    certain credit information
    
    Credit information includes your credit score, information in your consumer reports, and your account history.  
    
    We may also share information with Verizon Media as described in this or other Verizon privacy policies. Verizon Media respects the choices you make about the uses of your Verizon information.
    
    ### We share information with vendors and partners.
    
    We use vendors and partners to help us offer, provide, repair, restore and bill for services. We share information with them as necessary for them to perform work for us. They are required to protect information they receive from us or collect on our behalf and use it only for the purposes we allow.
    
    We also share de-identified information with companies to assist with the delivery of advertising campaigns or aggregate reports.
    
    When you purchase or use services that are offered by Verizon and one of our partners, both parties may receive your information. When this is the case, you should also review the partner company's privacy policy because it may describe uses of your information that are different from ours.
    
    ### We share directory listings and Caller ID information.
    
    We may publish your name, address and wireline telephone number(s) or provide this information to directory publishers, assistance services, or others. These companies can use this information in other formats or for other purposes, and they may make it available to others. We do not publish directories with wireless telephone numbers or make them available to others for listing in directories, unless you request that we do so.
    
    We also provide your name and wireline or wireless telephone number for Caller ID and similar services.
    
    ### We may disclose your information in other specific situations.
    
    In addition to the circumstances descri
