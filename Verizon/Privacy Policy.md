Español Full Privacy Policy

Protecting our customers' privacy is an important priority at Verizon and we are committed to maintaining strong and meaningful privacy protections. The privacy of your information is a significant responsibility and we value the trust you place in us.

Our Privacy Policy is designed to inform you about the information we collect, how we use it, and your options regarding certain uses of this information. This policy also describes privacy rights you have under certain federal laws.

This policy applies to website visitors, app users, applicants and Verizon customers in the United States. It applies across the Verizon family of companies and the products and services we provide. The Verizon family of companies includes the companies and joint ventures controlled by Verizon, including the Verizon telephone companies, Verizon Enterprise Solutions, Verizon Wireless, Verizon Online and  Oath. Certain services we offer such as go90, MapQuest and Verizon apps have additional privacy practices that are presented separately. 

Verizon has acquired Yahoo and combined it with AOL to form a new company named Oath. Oath consists of over 50 digital and mobile brands globally, including HuffPost, Yahoo News, Yahoo Sports, Tumblr and AOL, as well as advertising platforms such as ONE by AOL, BrightRoll, and Gemini. Oath and Yahoo each have their own privacy policies. In the event of a conflict between the Verizon privacy policy and the Oath or Yahoo privacy policies, the Oath policy will control when you use a site, product or service that links to the Oath privacy policy and the Yahoo privacy policy will apply when you use a site, service, or technology that links to the Yahoo policy.

A separate policy governs the collection of personal data by the Verizon family of companies outside the United States. Also, certain services offered to consumers as well as contracts between Verizon and its business customers (both U.S. and international) may contain additional privacy-related terms and conditions that are presented in other ways.

Information you provide

When you contact us for information or when you enter a Verizon-sponsored or affiliated contest, sweepstakes or promotion, we may use the information you supply to provide you with information about Verizon services, programs and offerings. Certain promotions may require that we disclose information such as contest winners or provide information for prize fulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by the promotion’s official rules.

Additional information for Verizon Wireless customers

Verizon Wireless includes a unique identifier in certain web traffic from your mobile device. The identifier is used to help deliver relevant advertising and to deliver other services such as authenticating devices on the network. If you opt out of the Relevant Mobile Advertising program and you have not joined Verizon Selects, or if you activate certain types of lines that are not eligible to participate in our advertising programs, Verizon Wireless will stop inserting the Unique Identifier Header (UIDH). The identifier will continue to appear for a short period of time while we are updating our systems.

Verizon Wireless collects and uses mobile device location data for a variety of purposes, including to provide our mobile voice and data services, emergency services, and our and third-party location-based apps and services such as navigation, weather, mapping and child safety apps or tools. Verizon apps that use location information provide choices about the use of this information.

Some Verizon wireless devices include system software that gathers diagnostic information we use to monitor network performance and the performance of your connections.  Other Verizon-supplied system software enables automatic installation of apps when you activate certain Android devices and with your consent at later times. For example, when you interact with a voice response system or an advertisement, the software can install an app you request or open an app or browser to a specific page. This software collects information about the actions it takes, including when an app is first opened or is uninstalled. Please note that some of the apps installed in this way do not have icons on the device screen. These apps have limited utility.  For example, they may facilitate the download of apps you select for your device, update apps you already have on your device,  or report to an app owner that an app has been opened on the device.  You can see and also delete or disable apps installed using Verizon-supplied software (whether the apps do or do not have icons on your device screen) using your device’s Application Manager under Settings. Apps on your device are governed by their own terms and privacy policy.

Verizon Wireless does not publish directories of our customers' wireless phone numbers, and we do not provide or make them available to third parties for listing in directories unless you request that we do so.

Information about the Cable Act

To the extent that Section 631 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the "Cable Act") applies to services you purchase, it entitles you to know about the personally identifiable information a cable service provider collects. This includes the nature of the use and disclosure of this information and to whom it may be disclosed, how long personally identifiable information is maintained, and how subscribers may access it. In addition, the Cable Act imposes limits on the collection and disclosure of personal information and gives subscribers the ability to enforce their privacy rights. (Personally identifiable information does not include aggregate data that does not identify a particular person).

The Cable Act allows a provider to use its cable system to collect personally identifiable information necessary to render a cable service or other services provided to subscribers and to detect and prevent unauthorized access to services. Additional personally identifiable information may be collected with the subscriber’s prior consent. Personally identifiable information may be used or disclosed without the subscriber’s consent where necessary to render services, and to conduct legitimate business activities related to services provided.

We may be required by law to disclose personally identifiable information to a governmental entity to comply with valid legal process, such as warrants, court orders or subpoenas, but we will not disclose records revealing your selection of video programming unless we receive a court order indicating that the governmental entity has made a specified showing of relevance and you were afforded an opportunity to contest the order. We may be required to disclose personally identifiable information (including your selection of video programming) to a non-governmental entity to comply with a court order, after you have been provided notice.

If you believe that your privacy rights have been violated, please e-mail us and we will work with you to address your concerns. If you believe that you have been aggrieved as a result of a violation of the Cable Act, you may enforce the limitations imposed by the Cable Act through a civil action in a United States district court seeking damages, attorney's fees, and litigation costs. Other rights and remedies may also be available to you under federal or other applicable laws.

The Cable Act permits the disclosure of customer names and addresses as long as a subscriber has been provided with the opportunity to prohibit or limit this disclosure and the disclosure does not reveal, directly or indirectly, the subscriber’s viewing or other uses of the cable or other services provided. If we intend to share data in this way, we will provide you with the opportunity to prohibit or limit this type of sharing.
