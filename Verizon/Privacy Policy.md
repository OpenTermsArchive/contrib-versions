    ### We collect information when you interact with us and use our products and services.

    the ways that you interact with us
    
    You may interact with us in a variety of ways, for example, when you visit our stores, call us, or use our websites or apps to place an order or ask questions about your account or services; contact us on social media; seek technical support; enter a Verizon-sponsored or affiliated contest, sweepstakes or promotion; or register to receive news or public policy updates.
    
    When you communicate with us, we may monitor or record the interaction to help us better serve you; to personalize your experiences; to train or otherwise support employees, resources or systems; and for security purposes. We may use artificial intelligence guided by humans, such as chat bots, to respond to your inquiry. When you interact with us through third-party services like Facebook Messenger or Twitter Direct Message, your communications are also governed by these companies’ privacy policies.
    
    *   [Contact, billing and other information you provide](#)
    *   [How you use our services and your devices](#)
    *   [How you use our websites and apps](#)

You can use your device app controls to disable notifications from Verizon App Manager to opt out of these messages.
    
    Some apps installed or updated on your device in this way do not appear as icons on your device screen because of their limited utility. For example, they might facilitate the download of apps you select for your device, update apps you already have on your device, or report to an app owner that an app has been opened on the device.

Apps on your device are governed by their own terms and privacy policies.

    ### Cookies, social media plug-ins and other website and app tools.
    
    You may see third-party advertisements on Verizon websites, services, apps and devices and see Verizon ads on others’ sites, services, apps and devices. These ads may be tailored for you based on information that we or [companies](#) acting on our behalf collect on Verizon sites and apps as well as from other sites and apps where these advertising entities also are present.
    
    companies
    
    For example, ad servers, ad networks or technology platforms. We may deliver Verizon marketing on our websites and apps and on non-Verizon websites and apps, by our representatives, via mail or email or via other Verizon services or devices.  
    
    To accomplish this type of advertising, advertising entities place and access [cookies and similar technologies](https://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/cookies) on browsers you use and access advertising identifiers from your mobile device operating systems. Information about your activities on the websites and in the apps where the entities are present is combined and used to determine whether you fall into an audience advertisers wish to reach.
    
    Advertising that is customized based on information about your visits over time and across different websites, apps and devices is known as "interest-based" advertising. In accordance with [industry self-regulatory principles](#), we require that advertising companies disclose when they are using interest-based advertising techniques to deliver interest-based ads on our sites and apps as well as when they deliver Verizon ads on other sites. We also require them to offer you an [ability to opt out](http://www.aboutads.info/) of this use of your information. 
    
    industry self-regulatory principles
    
    For example, the [Digital Advertising Alliance](https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/) enforces responsible privacy practices for users and providers of interest-based advertising. These practices include offering enhanced transparency and control to consumers.  
    
    You can visit the industry-wide [Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out page](https://www.aboutads.info/) to learn more and opt-out. Alternatively, you will see an [icon](#) ad choices icon in or around online advertisements placed using interest-based advertising techniques. You can click on the icon to learn more and opt out. Similarly, you have choices about this type of advertising on your mobile device  Apple devices allow apps to include interest-based advertising only if you opt in using the app’s pop-up notice. You can change your choice using Apple device settings. On Android devices, you can opt out using your device setting to “Opt out of Ads Personalization.”
    
    icon
    
    A click on this icon provides additional information about the companies and data practices used to deliver the ad and guidance about how you can opt out of this type of advertising.  
    
    Verizon websites and services may include social network or other third-party plug-ins and widgets that may provide information to their associated social networks or third parties even if you do not click on or otherwise interact with the plug-ins and widgets.
    
    We may also permit advertisers on our sites, apps and services to place ads based on certain information we have about your Verizon products and services, as well as geographic and demographic data. This information is not shared externally.
    
    ### We also use de-identified and aggregated information.
    
    We may de-identify or aggregate information so that Verizon or others may use it for business and marketing purposes. For example, the data we aggregate might be used to analyze, personalize and improve our services, to provide business and marketing insights to others and to help make advertising more relevant to you. [You have choices](#) about some of these uses.
    
    You have choices
    
    For example, you can opt out of our advertising and insights programs. [Go to choices](https://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/full-privacy-policy#acc-item-34).

    Fios TV apps include  Fios TV Mobile, an  app available on mobile devices, and Fios TV Home, an app available  on select devices  that support over-the-top and streaming video, such as Amazon Fire devices, AppleTV, Roku, or Verizon Stream TV.
    
    ### We share directory listings and Caller ID information.
    
    We may publish your name, address and wireline telephone number(s) or provide this information to directory publishers, assistance services, or others. These companies can use this information in other formats or for other purposes, and they may make it available to others. We do not publish directories with wireless telephone numbers or make them available to others for listing in directories, unless you request that we do so.
    
    We also provide your name and wireline or wireless telephone number for Caller ID and similar services.
    
    ### We may disclose your information in other specific situations.
    
    In addition to the circumstances described above, information that individually identifies you or your device may be shared in certain circumstances, such as:
    
    *   [To comply with the law](#)
    *   [To protect you, others or us](#)
    *   [To credit companies and collection agencies](#)
    *   When needed by outside auditors and regulators
    *   If Verizon enters into a merger, acquisition or sale of all or a portion of our assets or business
    *   With your consent
    
    To protect you, others or us
    
    This includes protecting our rights, property or the safety of our customers or employees; in cases involving danger of death or serious physical injury to any person or other emergencies; to protect against fraudulent malicious, abusive, unauthorized or unlawful use of our products and services and to protect our network, services, devices and users from such use.  
    
    To comply with the law
    
    This includes to comply with valid legal process including subpoenas, court orders or search warrants, and as otherwise authorized by law; and to advance or defend against complaints or legal claims in court, administrative proceedings, or elsewhere.

    ### Our Business and Marketing Insights program helps companies understand consumer behaviors in aggregate.
    
    This program uses [Verizon and third-party information](#) to create aggregate [business and marketing insights](#). The information we use and the insights we develop do not identify you individually and may be shared with third parties.
    
    Verizon and third-party information
    
    This includes information about how you use your mobile device (such as web browsing, device location, and app/feature use), certain information about your Verizon products and services (such as device type and amount of use), and demographic and interest information you provide or we obtain from other companies (such as gender, age range and interests). We may also use point of interest and  location information we obtain from others as well as information provided by business and marketing clients who want insights related to their own businesses.
    
    Business and marketing insights
    
    Insights are observations about groups of people that can be used to better understand consumer actions. For example, we may create insights about the number of customers in different age groups who visit a website, use an app, or go to a retail store or stadium. We also can develop insights to help estimate traffic patterns about people who move from one area to another during the morning rush hour.
    
    ### Our Identity Verification Service helps protect you against fraud.
    
    We use certain Verizon Wireless account, device and profile information to help third parties verify your identity on behalf of companies with which you do business, for example to help your bank confirm that you are calling rather than a fraudster. This helps protect you against theft and account takeover. Third parties that verify your  identity are contractually required to protect the information and use it only for providing their verification services.

    How does Verizon protect my information, and how do I update my account details?

    ](#acc-item-35)
    
    ### Information security and retention.
    
    We use technical, administrative and physical safeguards to help protect against unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of information we collect or store. In addition, we train our employees on the importance of privacy, security, and the proper ways to access, use and disclose customer information. Our practices and policies prohibit employees with whom we share this information from using sensitive information unless they are authorized to do so and have a business need. They also require us to keep personally identifiable information and other sensitive records only as long as reasonably necessary for business, accounting, tax or legal purposes.
    
    Although we strive to keep information secure, we can’t guarantee that our safeguards will prevent every unauthorized [attempt to access](#), use or disclose personal information. We use our security and incident response plans to handle such incidents. You can help secure your account using [advice, tips and tools we provide](https://www.verizon.com/about/responsibility/account-security).
    
    attempt to access
    
    For example, we have seen unauthorized attempts to access our customers' third party accounts, including accounts that customers have with financial institutions, email service providers or social media.  
    
    If you become aware of a security issue, contact the [Verizon Security Control Center](https://www.verizon.com/support/residential/account/manage-account/security/security-control-center) and we will work with you to address your concern.
    
    ### Let’s work together to keep children safe.
    
    If you see content you believe to be related to child sexual abuse, or if you see any other illegal content involving children when using a Verizon service, report it by sending an email to abuse-csam@verizon.com and include the words “child sexual abuse material” in the subject line. You can also make a report directly to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children through their [CyberTipline.](http://www.missingkids.org/gethelpnow/cybertipline)
    
    ### Sharing information on blogs and social networks.
    
    Some of our websites, apps and services let you participate in discussions, message boards and chat rooms, or leave reviews. These are public spaces so your comments can be read, collected and shared by anyone. By sharing information in these forums, you are giving consent to the disclosure of this information.
    
    ### Accessing and updating your account information.
    
    Customers can review and update their account information in the following ways:
    
    **Verizon Wireline**  
    call 1-800-VERIZON  
    or [access your Verizon home account online](https://www.verizon.com/home/myverizon/)
    
    **Verizon Wireless**  
    call 1-800-922-0204  
    or [access your Verizon mobile account online](http://verizonwireless.com/myprivacy)

    **Verizon Connect**  
    call 1-800-711-5800

    Use your app settings
    
    Customers who have Fios or other fiber-to-the-home services can [email](mailto:privacyoffice@verizon.com) us to set up an appointment to review the personally identifiable information we have about you. You can only review records that contain your personally identifiable information, and you’ll have to provide proper identification to do so. We’ll work with you to update your records if necessary. You may be charged for copies of documents that you request.

    Do I have specific rights under privacy laws in the United States?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    You may have additional rights under the Cable Act and state laws, including California, Maine and Nevada privacy laws.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    ](#acc-item-55)
    
    ### Information about the Cable Act
    
    The “Cable Act” (Section 631 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended) limits the collection and disclosure of personally identifiable information by cable operators and requires operators to tell you, to the extent that the Cable Act applies to the services you purchase, about the [personally identifiable information](#) they collect. 
    
    personally identifiable information
    
    Under the Cable Act, personally identifiable information does not include aggregate data that does not identify a particular person.  
    
    We may use our cable system to collect personally identifiable information necessary to render cable service or other services provided to you over the cable system and to detect and prevent unauthorized access to services. We may collect additional personally identifiable information with your prior consent. We may use or disclose personally identifiable information without consent where necessary to render services and to conduct legitimate business activities related to the services we provide.
    
    We may also disclose your name and address as long as you have the ability to prevent or limit this disclosure and the disclosure does not reveal, directly or indirectly, your viewing or other uses of the services we provide. We share name and address information with service partners as part of our Relevant TV advertising program. These providers work on our behalf to help our advertisers optimize their ads by preventing the same ads you see on Fios from being shown to you in other places. You can opt out of participating in the [Relevant TV advertising program](http://verizon.com/relevanttvfaqs).
    
    We may also share personally identifiable information if it is required by law to comply with [valid legal process](#).
    
    valid legal process
    
    We may disclose personally identifiable information to a governmental entity to comply with valid legal process, but we will not disclose records revealing your video programming unless we receive a court order indicating that the governmental entity has made a specified showing of relevance and you were afforded an opportunity to contest the order. We may be required to disclose personally identifiable information (including your video programming) to a non-governmental entity to comply with a court order, after you have been provided notice.  
    
    We retain personally identifiable information only as long as reasonably necessary for business, accounting, tax or legal purposes. If you would like to access your personally identifiable information, may email us at privacyoffice@verizon.com to arrange a time and convenient location to do so during business hours. If you believe any of your personally identifiable information is inaccurate, we will work with you to ensure that corrections are made.
    
    If you believe that your Cable Act privacy rights have been violated, please email us at privacyoffice@verizon.com and we will work with you to address your concerns. If you believe that you have been aggrieved as a result of a violation of the Cable Act, you may enforce the limitations imposed by the Cable Act through a civil action in a United States district court seeking damages, attorney's fees, and litigation costs. Other rights and remedies may also be available to you under federal or other applicable laws.
    
    ### California Consumer Privacy Act
    
    The [California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)](#) gives you specific rights as a California resident
    
    California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
    
    The law provides you with the right to know what information we collect about you and how we use it, to access and delete that information within certain limitations, to tell us not to sell personal information about you and to not be discriminated against for invoking these rights.
    
    **Your right to know.** We describe the personal information we collect and how we use it in this [privacy policy](https://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/full-privacy-policy?scrollto#acc-item-30). The information we collect varies depending on your interactions with us and the products and services you use. The California law requires us to let you know the [categories of personal information](#) we collect and use.
    
    Categories of personal information
    
    Categories of personal information we collect include: identifiers; records of products and services you purchase or use and how you use them; financial data; website, network or device activity; geolocation information; biometric information; professional and educational information; audio or visual information; inferences and insights about you; protected classifications; and other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated or linked with you.
    
    We collect personal information when you interact with us and use our products and services, [from certain third-party sources](https://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/full-privacy-policy#acc-item-30) and from our network and the devices you use. We use this information for [business and commercial purposes](#) as they are defined by the CCPA. [Service providers](#) we use to do work on our behalf (also called vendors in other sections of this privacy policy) may use information for the same purposes. We may also share information for legal compliance, for credit and collections purposes, with your consent and as further described in other sections of this policy.
    
    Service providers

    Business and commercial purposes include providing services to you; communicating with you and providing customer service; personalizing your experiences; improving our services; providing marketing and advertising; debugging; auditing our processes and services; short-term transient uses; research; and security, fraud, and legal compliance purposes.

    **Your right to say “[Do not sell my personal information](https://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/do-not-sell-my-info).”** The CCPA gives you the right to say no to the sale of personal information.
    
    We do not sell information that personally identifies you such as your name, telephone number, mailing address or email address. We may share that type of information with directory publishers and for caller ID purposes, excluding customers who have subscribed (at no charge) to unlisted or unpublished numbers.  
    
    We allow third-party advertising companies to collect information about your activity on our websites and in our apps, for example through [cookies and similar technologies,](https://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/cookies)  mobile ad identifiers, pixels, web beacons and social network plugins. These ad entities use information they collect to help us provide more relevant Verizon advertisements and other advertising purposes. This activity may be considered a sale under the CCPA. Visit [Digital Advertising Alliance Consumer Choice](https://youradchoices.com/control) to learn more about how you can limit this type of advertising. You also have choices aboutt this type of advertising on your mobile device. Apple devices allow apps to include interest-based advertising only if you opt in using the app’s pop-up notice. You can change your choice using Apple device settings. On Android devices, you can opt out using your device setting to “Opt out of Ads Personalization.”
    
    **Your right to not be discriminated against.** We do not [discriminate](#) against you if you exercise any rights described in this section.

    Nevada law allows customers to opt out of the [sale](#) of their personally identifiable information by online service providers such as website operators.
    
    sale
    
    Nevada law defines "sale" as the exchange of certain personally identifiable customer information for money. Personally identifiable information includes name, address, phone number, SSN, or any identifier that can be used to contact you electronically.  
    
    Verizon doesn’t sell personally identifiable information today and we don’t have plans to start. If Verizon ever starts selling such personal information, current Verizon customers will be opted out. If you have any questions, please contact us at nevada.privacy@verizon.com.
    
    ### Maine Broadband Customer Privacy Rights
    
    The [Maine Broadband Internet Access Service Customer Privacy Act](#), effective on July 1, 2020, gives you additional privacy rights when we are your broadband Internet access service provider. The Maine law gives you the right to control certain ways that we use or share information we have about you and requires that we provide you with a notice of your rights and our obligations under this law. We do this in this section.
    
    Maine Broadband Internet Access Service Customer Privacy Act
    
    The law applies to current or former subscribers of mass market broadband Internet access service in Maine. It also applies to applicants for this service. 
    
    The Maine law also requires us to take reasonable measures to protect your [customer personal information](#). We describe this in an earlier section of this [privacy policy](https://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/full-privacy-policy?scroll#acc-item-35).
    
    customer personal information
    
    Maine law defines “customer personal information” as personally identifying information about a customer or information from a customer’s use of broadband Internet access service. 
    
    We will not use, disclose, sell, or permit access to your broadband customer personal information except for [purposes allowed under the Maine law](#) or with your affirmative consent. We may ask you for this consent when we interact with you. For example, we may ask to use your broadband customer personal information to market [additional services](#) to you when you call us or come into our stores.
    
    Purposes allowed under the Maine law
    
     Maine law allows us to use and/or share broadband customer personal information to provide and maintain your broadband services; market and advertise our communications-related services to you; comply with lawful court orders; bill and collect; protect users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of or subscription to such services; or provide location information in response to certain emergency situations.
    
    additional services
    
    By “additional services,” we mean Verizon or partner services that are not communications-related.
    
    The Maine law also provides you with a right to opt-out of any use or sharing of data that is not customer personal information under the law. At this time, we do not collect information about you as a broadband customer that is not customer personal information. If we begin collecting such information in the future, we will give you the right to opt out of its use and sharing. 
    
    We will not refuse to provide you with broadband service, charge you a penalty, or offer you a discount based on whether you agree that we can use or share your broadband customer personal information.
