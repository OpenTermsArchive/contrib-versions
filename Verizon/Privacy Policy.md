    --------------------------------------
    
    Learn about the information Verizon collects about you, your devices and your use of products and services we provide.](#acc-item-30)
    
    ### We collect information when you interact with us and use our products and services.
    
    The types of information we, or service providers acting on our behalf, collect depends on your use of our products and services and [the ways that you interact with us](#). This may include information about:
    
    the ways that you interact with us
    
    You may interact with us in a variety of ways, for example, when you visit our stores, call us, or use our sites or apps to place an order or ask questions about your account or services; work with Verizon as a representative of a business customer; contact us on social media; seek technical support; open emails we send or interact with our ads; enter a Verizon-sponsored or affiliated contest, sweepstakes or promotion; or register to receive news or public policy updates. 
    
    When you communicate with us, we may monitor or record the interaction to help us better serve you; to personalize your experiences; to train or otherwise support employees, resources or systems; and for security purposes. We may use artificial intelligence managed by humans, such as chatbots, to respond to your inquiry. When you interact with us through third-party services like Facebook Messenger, your communications are also governed by these companies’ privacy policies.
    
    * [Contact, billing and other information you provide](#)
    * [How you use our services and your devices](#)
    * [How you use our sites and apps](#)
    * [How our network and your devices are working](#)
    * [Location of your wireless devices](#)
    
    Contact, billing and other information you provide
    
    This includes your name, address, email, phone numbers where you can be reached, images, voice recordings or voiceprints, other biometric identifiers, date of birth, driver's license number, Social Security Number or Tax Identifier and payment information.
    
    It can also include information you provide, including in surveys, Verizon-sponsored promotions, device setup, and grant or job apps.
    
    How you use our services and your devices
    
    Depending on the services you use, this may include: call records containing phone numbers you call and receive calls from, sites you visit, text records, wireless location, application and feature usage, product and device-specific information and identifiers, router connections, domain name server information, service options you choose, mobile and device numbers, video streaming and video packages and usage, movie rental and purchase data, TV and video viewership, speed and other driving characteristics, and other similar information.  
    
    How you use our sites and apps
    
    This includes information about your browsing, searching and buying activities such as your IP address, mobile phone number, device numbers and identifiers, web addresses of the sites you come from and go to next, screen recordings, cursor movements, screen interactions and clicks, browser and operating system information, platform type, connection speed and other attributes. We may derive the general area you are in and the internet service provider you are using from the IP address you use.  
    
    How our network and your devices are working
    
    We monitor the condition of our networks, including Fios Internet Wi-Fi, such as traffic flow, speed, capacity, power, quality and environmental conditions including nearby Wi-Fi access points. We may also collect test information from or take pictures or a video of equipment we install or repair.
    
    We install system software on some wireless devices which may:
    
    * collect information about network and device conditions including location, battery life and apps on the device.
    * automatically install apps or software when you activate your device, during certain operating system upgrades and with your consent at later times, for example, when you request an app from an advertisement. The software may also update apps that it installed on your device or when you otherwise permit it.  It also collects information when an app it places is first opened or is uninstalled and may send you notifications about Verizon and third-party offers and promotions that may interest you. You can use your device app controls to disable notifications from Verizon App Manager to opt out of these messages.
    
    Some apps installed or updated on your device in this way do not appear as icons on your device screen because of their limited utility. For example, they might facilitate the download of apps you select for your device, update apps you already have on your device, or report to an app owner that an app has been opened on the device. You can see and also delete or disable apps installed on your device, whether or not they have visible icons, using your device’s Application Manager under Settings. Apps on your device are governed by their own terms and privacy policies.
    
    Location of your wireless devices
    
    We collect cell tower location information. Based on what you have allowed, we may also collect Wi-Fi, Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) and other location information, for example, through Verizon apps you use  
    
    Business customers may have contracts with us that include privacy provisions that are specific to that relationship and differ from what you find here. Your contract will govern in those cases. 
    
    ### We also obtain information from others.
    
    This includes: 
    
    * [Credit information from outside agencies](#)
    * [Demographic and interest data](#) as well as device type, carrier, city and state information from third party data providers
    * [Information from social media platforms](#) when you interact with us via social media or use your social media login to interact with Verizon sites or offers
    * [Contact, marketing lead and other information we purchase or receive](#)
    * [Fraud information](#)
    
    Credit information from outside agencies
    
    We obtain this information when you purchase products, apply for services, or when we pre qualify you for products or services.  
    
    Demographic and interest data
    
    For example, this information could include gender, age range, education level, sports enthusiast, frequent diner and other demographics and interests.  
    
    Information from social media platforms
    
    This includes information we obtain from your public profile as well as interests, "likes" and similar information you permit social media companies to provide to us.  
    
    Contact, marketing lead and other information we purchase or receive
    
    This includes lead information we purchase as well as leads we obtain from "refer a friend" and similar programs. It also includes landlord information when we need it for installing, repairing or maintaining equipment.  
    
    Fraud information
    
    This includes risk scores and other indicators we receive from companies that help us identify fraud.  
    
* [How does Verizon use information?
    ---------------------------------
    
    Learn about the different ways we use the information we collect.](#acc-item-31)
    
    ### We use information to provide you with services and enhance your experiences with us.
    
    We use information to:
    
    * Deliver and maintain products and services
    * Establish and maintain your account and billing records
    * Measure credit and payment risk
    * Provide account-related services and information
    * Help you with service and technical support issues or questions
    * Manage and protect our networks, services, employees and users
    * Detect and prevent fraud
    * Help us improve and [personalize your services and our marketing](#)
    
    Personalize your services and our marketing
    
    For example, we may use information we collect to tailor the content you see and personalize our communications with you and your experiences with us, manage the frequency with which you see an advertisement, tailor advertisements to better match your interests, provide service-related notices and understand the effectiveness of our advertising.
    
    * Research, develop and market new products and services
    * Authenticate you
    * [Determine your eligibility for new products and services](#)
    * [Better predict and deliver personalized content and offers](#) that may interest you
    
    Determine your eligibility for new products and services
    
    For example, we may use information to determine whether you are eligible for service upgrades or to prescreen you for credit (unless you have opted out using the [industry-wide](https://www.optoutprescreen.com/) [opt out](https://www.optoutprescreen.com/) or by calling 1-888-567-8688).  
    
    Better predict and deliver personalized content and offers
    
    We may deliver Verizon marketing on our sites and apps and on non-Verizon sites and apps; by our representatives; and via mail, email, or other Verizon services or devices. To do this we may generate unique identifiers from your email or mobile telephone number. We may also place advertisements on our sites, apps or services for third party products and services offered by Verizon. These ads may be placed based on information we have about your Verizon products and services, and geographic and demographic information.  
    
    information about your visits
    
    This applies to information we collect as part of providing broadband Internet access services to you.  
    
    We may use automation, including artificial intelligence, to assist us with these uses. Among the uses we make of automation, we use predictive analytics to monitor our network for faults and outages which helps us proactively and rapidly fix issues, and we may use machine learning techniques with information we have about you and other customers to provide you with more relevant marketing messages or predict what services might most interest you.
    
    Our Custom Experience program uses information about [sites you visit and apps you use](#) on your mobile device to help us better personalize our communications with you, give you more relevant product and service recommendations, and develop plans, services, and offers that are more appealing to you. You are included in the program [unless you opt out.](https://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/full-privacy-policy#acc-item-34)
    
    sites you visit and apps you use
    
    We use only the first part of the web addresses (URLs) you visit (the part that includes the top level domain and subdomain of the URL); we do not use information past the first “/” or “?” in the URL. We use this information and usage patterns within this information to predict your interests, preferences and other insights we use in the program. 
    
    Our Custom Experience Plus program uses a broader set of information for the same purposes, including information about sites you visit and apps you use, your Verizon Fios services, location information, and Customer Proprietary Network Information, including phone numbers you call or those that call you. You must [opt in to be part of this program](https://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/full-privacy-policy#acc-item-34).
    
    More information about our Custom Experience programs is available in our [program FAQs](https://www.verizon.com/support/verizon-custom-experience-programs-faqs).

    We and these third-party companies may use [cookies, pixels, web beacons, tags, scripts, or similar technologies](https://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/cookies) on our pages and the browsers you use and may access advertising or other identifiers from your mobile device operating systems.

* [Does Verizon disclose my information?
    -------------------------------------
    
    We disclose information within Verizon, with service providers who do work on our behalf, and with third parties as further described in this section.](#acc-item-33)
    
    ### We disclose information within Verizon.
    
    We disclose information within Verizon, including with our affiliates, for a variety of purposes, including providing you with the latest information about our products and services and offering you our latest promotions. You can limit the disclosure of [Customer Proprietary Network Information](#) and [certain credit information](#) if you do not want us to use them to market services to you that are different from the ones you have.
    
    Customer Proprietary Network Information
    
    Customer Proprietary Network Information (or CPNI) is information that relates to the type, quantity, destination, technical configuration, location, amount of use and related billing information of your telecommunications or interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services. Federal law governs our use and disclosure of CPNI.  
    
    certain credit information
    
    Credit information includes your credit score, information in your consumer reports, and your account history.  
    
    ### We disclose information to service providers and partners.
    
    **Service Providers.** We use service providers to help us offer, provide, repair, restore and bill for services. We disclose information to them as necessary for them to perform work for us. They are required to protect information they receive from us or collect on our behalf and use it only for the purposes we allow.
    
    We may disclose to or we may allow our service providers to collect personal information, including your activity on our sites and in our apps. These companies may use technologies, such as [cookies, pixels, web beacons, tags, scripts, or similar technologies](https://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/cookies) on our pages and the browsers you use or we may disclose information using application programming interfaces (APIs). These service providers help us improve website and app security, authenticate you, detect and deter fraud, improve site performance, provide content or analytics, conduct advertising and marketing activity and other purposes as described in the “How does Verizon use information” section.
    
    **Partners.** When you purchase or use services that are offered by Verizon and one of our partners, both parties may collect information about you. When this is the case, you should also review the partner company's privacy policy because it may describe uses of information that are different from ours.
    
    We disclose information about your devices’ 5G connectivity with mobile device operating system providers and app developers so that they can optimize your 5G experience. 
    
    We may also switch your device connectivity from our wireless network to in-building network providers such as neutral host and Wi-Fi networks, when you enter certain private buildings, venues, or campuses, and they may collect information as needed to provide device connectivity service to you.
    
    We disclose risk scores with other companies for fraud purposes. 
    
    We also disclose or make available de-identified information to companies to assist with the delivery of advertising campaigns or aggregate reports. 
    
    ### We disclose information to advertising companies.
    
    We may disclose, or allow certain [third-party advertising companies](#) to collect, information about your activity on our sites and in our apps. These companies may use your email address, or other information they collect to create one or more identifiers associated with you or your device(s) both on and off our sites and in our apps. They can use that information to help us provide more relevant Verizon advertising on our own and third-party sites and apps. These companies may combine this information with information they collect elsewhere to determine whether you or someone with similar interests may fit into an audience that advertisers, including Verizon, are trying to reach, to serve targeted advertising to you on our sites and other sites and platforms, or to find other potential customers. To do this, we and these companies use a variety of tracking, validation and other technologies, such as [cookies, pixels, web beacons, tags, scripts, or similar technologies](https://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/cookies) on our pages and the browsers you use, or we may disclose information using application programming interfaces (APIs).
    
    third-party advertising companies
    
    For example, advertising partners, including social media networks. We may deliver Verizon marketing on our sites and apps and on non-Verizon sites and apps, by our representatives, via mail or email or via other Verizon services or devices. 
    
    We require that advertising companies disclose when they are using interest-based advertising techniques to deliver ads on our sites and apps as well as when they deliver Verizon ads elsewhere. We also require them to comply with privacy laws and offer you the ability to opt out of this use of your information. 
    
    Verizon sites and services may also include social networks or other third-party plug-ins and widgets that may provide information to their associated social networks or third parties even if you do not click on or otherwise interact with the plug-ins and widgets. 
    
    Our customers and website visitors can limit the sale and sharing of personal information as well as the use of this information for certain types of targeted advertising. Certain states give consumers who reside in those states the right to make these opt out choices. California law also gives business customers the right to limit the sale and sharing of personal information.
    
    Please visit the [Choices section](https://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/full-privacy-policy#acc-item-34) of this policy to learn how to opt out.

    The [Fios TV apps](#) and website include [Comscore](https://www.comscore.com/About/Privacy/Data-Subject-Rights) and [Nielsen](https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/legal/privacy-statement/digital-measurement/) software that collects information for these companies’ market research and audience measurement purpose, including information about the content you viewed; the apps, website and device you used; your advertising identifier (if available); IP address; and operating system.

    Insights are observations about groups of people that can be used to better understand consumer actions. For example, we may create insights about the number of customers in different age groups who visit a website, use an app, or go to a retail store or stadium. We also can develop insights to help estimate traffic patterns about people who move from one area to another during the morning rush hour.
    
    ### Our Identity Verification Service helps protect you against fraud.
    
    We use certain Verizon Wireless account, device and profile data on behalf of companies with which you do business, for example, to help your bank confirm that you are calling rather than a fraudster, which may help protect you against theft and account takeover. Third parties that verify your identity are contractually required to protect the information and use it only for providing their verification services.

* [How does Verizon protect my information, and how do I update my account details?
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Learn about our information security and retention practices and how to update your account information.](#acc-item-35)
    
    ### Information security and retention.
    
    We use technical, administrative and physical safeguards to help protect against unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of information we collect or store. In addition, we train our employees on the importance of privacy and security, as well as the proper ways to access, use and disclose customer information. Our practices and policies prohibit employees with whom we disclose this information from using sensitive information unless they are authorized to do so and have a business need.
    
    Our policies require that we retain records for as long as they are needed for legal, tax, audit, investigative, and security purposes and then securely delete or destroy them. We incorporate personal information into different types of records, not always by distinct data elements. For example, your name is part of your account, billing, technical support and call detail records.
    
    Although we strive to keep information secure, we can’t guarantee that our safeguards will prevent every unauthorized [attempt to access](#), use or disclose personal information. We use our security and incident response plans to handle such incidents. You can help secure your account using [advice, tips and tools we provide](https://www.verizon.com/about/responsibility/account-security).
    
    attempt to access
    
    For example, we have seen unauthorized attempts to access our customers' third party accounts, including accounts that customers have with financial institutions, email service providers or social media.  
    
    If you become aware of a security issue, please visit our page to [Report Security Vulnerabilities](https://www.verizon.com/solutions-and-services/report-security-vulnerability/) and follow the instructions to report your issue. We will work with you to address your concern. 
    
    ### Let’s work together to keep children safe.
    
    If you see content you believe to be related to child sexual abuse, or if you see any other illegal content involving children when using a Verizon service, report it by sending an email to abuse-csam@verizon.com and include the words “child sexual abuse material” in the subject line. You can also make a report directly to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children through their [CyberTipline.](http://www.missingkids.org/gethelpnow/cybertipline)
    
    ### Disclosing information in public forums.
    
    Some of our sites, apps and services let you participate in discussions or leave reviews. These are public spaces so your comments can be read, collected and shared by anyone. By sharing information in these forums, you are giving consent to the disclosure of this information.
    
    ### Accessing and updating your account information.
    
    Customers can review and update their account information in the following ways:
    
    **Verizon Wireline**  
    call 1-800-VERIZON  
    or [access your Verizon home account online](https://www.verizon.com/home/myverizon/)
    
    **Verizon Wireless**

You can only review records that contain your personally identifiable information, and you’ll have to provide proper identification to do so. We’ll work with you to update our records if necessary. You may be charged for copies of documents that you request.
    
* [Do I have additional rights under Federal law?
    ----------------------------------------------
    
    You may have additional rights under the Cable Act.](#acc-item-1265)
    
    ### Information about the Cable Act
    
    The “Cable Act” (Section 631 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended) limits the collection and disclosure of personally identifiable information by cable operators and requires operators to tell you, to the extent that the Cable Act applies to the services you purchase, about the [personally identifiable information](#) they collect.
    
    Personally Identifiable Information
    
    Under the Cable Act, personally identifiable information does not include aggregate data that does not identify a particular person
    
     We may use our cable system to collect personally identifiable information necessary to render cable service or other services provided to you over the cable system and to detect and prevent unauthorized access to services. We may collect additional personally identifiable information with your prior consent. We may use or disclose personally identifiable information without consent where necessary to render services and to conduct legitimate business activities related to the services we provide.
    
    We may also disclose your name and address as long as you have the ability to prevent or limit this disclosure and the disclosure does not reveal, directly or indirectly, your viewing or other uses of the services we provide. We disclose name and address information to service providers as part of our Relevant TV advertising program. These providers work on our behalf to help our advertisers optimize their ads by preventing the same ads you see on Fios from being shown to you in other places. You can opt out of participating in the [Relevant TV advertising program](http://verizon.com/relevanttvfaqs). 
    
    We may also disclose personally identifiable information if it is required by law to comply with [valid legal process](#).
    
    Valid Legal Process
    
    We may disclose personally identifiable information to a governmental entity to comply with valid legal process, but we will not disclose records revealing your video programming unless we receive a court order indicating that the governmental entity has made a specified showing of relevance and you were afforded an opportunity to contest the order. We may be required to disclose personally identifiable information (including your video programming) to a non-governmental entity to comply with a court order, after you have been provided notice.
    
     We retain personally identifiable information only as long as reasonably necessary for business, accounting, tax or legal purposes. If you would like to access the personally identifiable information we have about you, please submit a [privacy inquiry form](https://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/privacy-inquiries) to arrange a time and convenient location to do so during business hours. If you believe any of your personally identifiable information is inaccurate, we will work with you to update our records.
    
    If you believe that your Cable Act privacy rights have been violated, please submit a [privacy inquiry form](https://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/privacy-inquiries) and we will work with you to address your concerns. If you believe that you have been aggrieved as a result of a violation of the Cable Act, you may enforce the limitations imposed by the Cable Act through a civil action in a United States district court seeking damages, attorney's fees, and litigation costs. Other rights and remedies may also be available to you under federal or other applicable laws.

    **You have the right to know what personal information we collect, how we use it, and how long we keep it.** This privacy policy provides details about our collection and use practices. California law requires that we also describe the [categories of personal information we collect and use](#) and the sources of that information. We collect personal information [when you interact with us](#) and use our products and services, from third parties and from our network and the devices you use. Some of the information we collect is considered [sensitive personal information under California law](#).

    * Genetic, biometric and health information, for example, some Verizon apps allow you to disclose health information with your trusted or emergency contacts. Another Verizon service uses voice recognition technology to allow you to secure your Verizon accounts. 
    * Demographic and interest data and fraud indicators we obtain from outside companies. 
    * And other information that may identify, relate to, describe, or is capable of being associated with you, for example, information you provide to us, or grant us permission to collect such as through our mobile applications. This may include contacts, profile photos, motion activity, vehicle information or in limited circumstances, we may collect your insurance policy number if it is needed for processing damage claims.
    
    We use the information we collect for [business and commercial purposes](#) as they are defined by the CCPA. We disclose information to [service providers who do work on our behalf](#); and others for credit and collections, directory assistance and caller ID purposes;, with your consent; and as further described in other sections of this policy.
    
    service providers who do work on our behalf
    
    We disclose information to service providers as necessary for them to perform work for us. We disclose to them the information they need to perform that work. This includes personal information about you. For example, we disclose contact information to service providers who help us send Verizon marketing campaigns and device information to other service providers who help us monitor our network and provide technical support. Service providers are required to protect the information we disclose to them or they collect on our behalf and use it only for the specific purposes that we allow.
    
    business and commercial purposes
    
    These purposes include providing you products and services, operating our businesses, and engaging in economic activities such as communicating with you and providing customer service; personalizing your experiences; improving our services; providing marketing and advertising; debugging; auditing our processes and services; short-term transient uses; research; and security, fraud, and legal compliance.
    
    Our policies require that we retain records containing personal information for as long as they are needed for legal, tax, audit, investigative, and security purposes and then securely delete or destroy them. We incorporate personal information into different types of records; it is not always retained by distinct data elements. For example, your name is part of your account, billing, technical support and call detail records.   
    
    **You have the right to access, delete and correct information.** You can request access to specific pieces and categories of personal information we collect by using our [Privacy Dashboard](https://www.verizon.com/privacy/your-data) and following the instructions there, or by calling 1-800-333-3972. We will provide this information to you in a portable and readily usable format. You can use this same contact information to request that we delete personal information we have about you [unless we need it for specific reasons](#), and to correct inaccurate personal information we have about you. 
    
    unless we need it for specific reasons
    
    The law describes these reasons to include: needing the information to provide the services you have requested and other activities needed to maintain an ongoing business relationship or perform a contract with you, to maintain information security, to exercise legal rights and to comply with other laws.
    
    **You have a right to inform us that you do not want your personal information sold or shared.** California law defines “sale or sharing” to include sharing personal information for monetary or other valuable consideration and the sharing of information we have about you for cross contextual advertising purposes. The definition does not cover all disclosures of personal information. We do not knowingly sell or share personal information related to children under 16 years of age. 
    
    Since 2023 and presently, we engage in the following activities that may be considered selling or sharing. We sell or share personal information with advertising technology companies, including those present on our websites, who combine that information with information they collect about your visits to other sites or that they otherwise have about you to provide more personalized advertising to you. This occurs through the use of cookies, pixels, tags, application programming interfaces (APIs), scripts and similar technologies. We also engage in sale and sharing when we disclose personal information we have about you, or personal information we obtained from your activity across third-party businesses, websites, apps or services, to other companies to better target ads to you, to find others like you who might value our services, or when we use personal information as part of [our own internal programs](#).
    
    our own internal programs
    
    Our programs include Custom Experience, Custom Experience Plus, Relevant TV Advertising, Relevant Online Advertising, and Fios TV market research and audience measurement.

We do not respond to Do Not Track signals.
    
    **You have the right to limit the use of sensitive personal information.** This right lets you ask us to limit the use and disclosure of sensitive personal information if we use that information for purposes beyond what is needed to provide the products and services you request or for other [reasons specified in the law](#). We do not use or disclose sensitive personal information for other purposes without your consent so we do not offer you an option to limit the use of sensitive personal information.
    
    reasons specified in the law
    
    These reasons include: detecting security incidents; resisting malicious, deceptive, fraudulent or illegal actions; ensuring the physical safety of a person; short-term, transient uses; performing services such as maintaining or servicing accounts, providing customer service, fulfilling orders and transactions; verifying your information; and verifying, maintaining or enhancing a service on a device that is owned manufactured or controlled by us or on your device.

The state laws generally require that we provide you information about the [categories of personal information we collect and the purposes for which we collect each category](#).

    5. Genetic, biometric and health information for limited purposes such as some Verizon apps allow you to provide health information to your trusted or emergency contacts. Another Verizon service uses voice recognition technology to allow you to secure your Verizon accounts.
    6. Other information that may identify, relate to, describe, or is capable of being associated with you, for example, in limited circumstances, we may collect your insurance policy number if it is needed for processing damage claims. 
    
    We collect personal information [when you interact with us](#) and use our products and services, from certain third-party sources and from our network and the devices you use. Some of the information we collect is considered [sensitive personal information under the state laws](#). We retain information only as long as reasonably necessary for business, accounting, tax or legal purposes and then securely delete it.
    
    sensitive personal information under the state laws
    
    The laws describe sensitive data to include some or all of the following:  personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, national origin, religious beliefs, mental or physical health condition or diagnosis (including pregnancy), sex life or sexual orientation, status as transgender or nonbinary, citizenship or immigration status, processing genetic or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying you, personal data collected from a known child, precise geolocation information, certain financial information, and status as a crime victim. Our policy describes the specific sensitive personal information that we collect.
    
    when you interact with us
    
    You may interact with us in different ways, for example, when you place an order or have questions about your account or services; work with Verizon as a representative of a business customer; contact us on social media; seek technical support; enter a Verizon-sponsored or affiliated contest, sweepstakes or promotion; or register to receive news or public policy updates.
    
    [Third parties](#) we use to do work on our behalf may use information for the same purposes. We may also disclose information to others for credit and collections, directory assistance and caller id purposes; with your consent; and as further described in other sections of this policy.
    
    Third parties
    
    We disclose information to service providers (also known as processors) as necessary for them to perform work for us. They are required to protect the information they receive from us or collect on our behalf and use it only for the specific purposes that we allow.
    
    **Your rights to access, delete and correct information.** You can request access to specific personal information we have about you using our [Privacy Dashboard](https://www.verizon.com/privacy/your-data) and following the instructions there, or by calling 1-800-333-3972. We will provide this information to you in a portable and readily usable format. You can use this same contact information to request that we delete personal information we have about you, [unless we need it for reasons specified by the laws](#), and to correct inaccurate personal information we have about you. 
    
    unless we need it for reasons specified by the laws
    
    These state privacy law describe these reasons slightly differently, but generally, they include: needing the information to provide the services you use and the internal operations needed to maintain an ongoing business relationship or perform a contract with you, maintaining information security, preventing fraud, and exercising our legal rights including defending against legal claims, complying with laws and cooperating with law enforcement in good faith. 
    
    **Use of sensitive personal information**. These state laws prohibit us from using sensitive personal information without your consent, except as [specified in the law](#). We use sensitive personal information as authorized by the law or after we obtain your express consent.

    **You have a right to tell us not to sell personal information or process it for certain targeted advertising purposes.** The laws vary in the way they define sale and certain targeted advertising, but generally, they require that we provide you with the ability to limit activities that involve disclosing personal information for monetary or other valuable consideration and using personal information about you from your activity across other websites or apps to target ads to you. The definitions do not cover all disclosure of personal information. We do not knowingly sell personal information related to children under 16 years of age, or knowingly use such information for targeted advertising purposes.

This occurs through the use of cookies, pixels, tags, beacons, application programming interfaces and similar technologies. We may engage in offline sale and targeted advertising  when we obtain personal information from or share personal information we have about you with other companies to better target ads to you, to find others like you who might value our services, or when we use personal information as part of [our own internal programs](#).

    ### Illinois Biometric Information Privacy
    
    The Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act applies to [Biometric Identifiers or Biometric Information](#).
    
    Biometric Identifiers or Biometric Information
    
    Biometric Identifiers means a retina or iris scan, fingerprint, voiceprint, or scan of your hand or face geometry. Biometric Identifiers do not include writing samples, written signatures, photographs, demographic data, tattoo descriptions or physical descriptions such as height or weight. “Biometric Information” means information that is based on an individual’s biometric identifier used to identify an individual.
    
    **What we collect and how we use it.** We may collect and use certain Biometric Information to verify or authenticate your identity; to protect against fraud; and for safety and other security purposes. We collect Biometric Information when you consent to voice or facial authentication. When you permit us to scan your face geometry or create a voiceprint, we turn it into a stored numerical representation (the “template”). Each time you scan your face geometry or later when you speak to one of our representatives, we compare your face or your voice to the stored template associated with your account. If they match, we are able to authenticate you so that you can access account information, complete account transactions, get assistance from a Verizon representative, or visit a Verizon corporate office.
    
    **When we** **disclose Biometric Information.** We may disclose Biometric Information to service providers who work on our behalf. These service providers may use the Biometric Information disclosed to them only for purposes related to providing service to Verizon, and are required to delete the information when it is no longer needed to provide the service. We may also disclose Biometric Information to comply with law as described in the Does Verizon Disclose Information section of this Policy.
    
    **How long we retain Biometric Information.** We retain Biometric Information as follows (unless we are legally required to retain it longer):
    
    * We retain scans of your face geometry or voiceprint very briefly. We permanently delete the first scan after we use it to generate the stored template. Each time you authenticate, we retain your face geometry or voiceprint scan long enough to compare it to the template, then we permanently delete the scan. 
    * We retain the stored template until the purpose for collecting it is satisfied. For instance, we retain stored templates of face scans for approximately 90 days from the date that you provided it. We retain voiceprints for as long as you are an active customer and are enrolled in voice authentication. Voiceprints are deleted approximately 24 hours after unenrollment or termination of service.
    * We may also retain biometric data as otherwise required to comply with applicable law or valid legal/judicial process.
    
    ### Maine Broadband Customer Privacy Rights
    
    The [Maine Broadband Internet Access Service Customer Privacy Act](#), effective on July 1, 2020, gives you additional privacy rights when we are your broadband Internet access service provider. The Maine law gives you the right to control certain ways that we use or disclose information we have about you and requires that we provide you with a notice of your rights and our obligations under this law. We do this in this section.
    
      
    de you with a notice of your rights and our obligations under this law. We do this in this section.
    
    Maine Broadband Internet Access Service Customer Privacy Act
    
    The law applies to current or former subscribers of mass market broadband Internet access service in Maine. It also applies to applicants for this service. 
    
    The Maine law also requires us to take reasonable measures to protect [customer personal information](#). We describe this in an earlier section of this [privacy policy](https://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/full-privacy-policy?scroll#acc-item-35).
    
    customer personal information
    
    Maine law defines “customer personal information” as personally identifying information about a customer or information from a customer’s use of broadband Internet access service. 
    
    We will not use, disclose, sell, or permit access to your Maine broadband customer personal information except for [purposes allowed under the Maine law](#) or with your affirmative consent. We may ask you for this consent when we interact with you. For example, we may ask to use broadband customer personal information to market [additional services](#) to you when you call us or come into our stores.
    
    Purposes allowed under the Maine law
    
    Maine law allows us to use and disclose broadband customer personal information to provide and maintain your broadband services; market and advertise our communications-related services to you; comply with lawful court orders; bill and collect; protect users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of or subscription to such services; or provide location information in response to certain emergency situations**.**
    
    additional services
    
    By “additional services,” we mean Verizon or partner services that are not communications-related.
    
    The Maine law also provides you with a right to opt-out of any use or disclosure of data that is not customer personal information under the law. At this time, we do not collect information about you as a broadband customer that is not customer personal information. If we begin collecting such information in the future, we will give you the right to opt out of its use and disclosure.  
    
    We will not refuse to provide you with broadband service, charge you a penalty, or offer you a discount based on whether you agree that we can use or disclose your broadband customer personal information.

    Verizon doesn’t sell personally identifiable information today and we don’t have plans to start. If Verizon ever starts selling such personal information, current Verizon customers will be opted out. If you have questions, please submit a [privacy inquiries form](https://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/privacy-inquiries).
