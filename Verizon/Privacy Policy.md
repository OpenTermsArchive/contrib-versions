    --------------------------------------
    
    Learn about the information Verizon collects about you, your devices and your use of products and services we provide.](#acc-item-30)
    
    ### We collect information when you interact with us and use our products and services.
    
    The types of information we, or service providers acting on our behalf, collect depends on your use of our products and services and [the ways that you interact with us](#). This may include information about:
    
    the ways that you interact with us
    
    You may interact with us in a variety of ways, for example, when you visit our stores, call us, or use our sites or apps to place an order or ask questions about your account or services; work with Verizon as a representative of a business customer; contact us on social media; seek technical support; enter a Verizon-sponsored or affiliated contest, sweepstakes or promotion; or register to receive news or public policy updates. 
    
    When you communicate with us, we may monitor or record the interaction to help us better serve you; to personalize your experiences; to train or otherwise support employees, resources or systems; and for security purposes. We may use artificial intelligence managed by humans, such as chatbots, to respond to your inquiry. When you interact with us through third-party services like Facebook Messenger or Twitter Direct Message, your communications are also governed by these companies’ privacy policies.
    
    * [Contact, billing and other information you provide](#)
    * [How you use our services and your devices](#)
    * [How you use our sites and apps](#)
    * [How our network and your devices are working](#)
    * [Location of your wireless devices](#)
    
    Contact, billing and other information you provide
    
    This includes your name, address, email, phone numbers where you can be reached, images, voice recordings or voiceprints, other biometric identifiers, date of birth, driver's license number, Social Security Number or Tax Identifier and payment information.
    
    It can also include information you provide in surveys, Verizon-sponsored promotions, and grant or job apps.
    
    How you use our services and your devices
    
    Depending on the services you use, this may include: call records containing phone numbers you call and receive calls from, sites you visit, text records, wireless location, application and feature usage, product and device-specific information and identifiers, router connections, domain name server information, service options you choose, mobile and device numbers, video streaming and video packages and usage, movie rental and purchase data, TV and video viewership, speed and other driving characteristics, and other similar information.  
    
    How you use our sites and apps
    
    This includes information about your browsing, searching and buying activities such as your IP address, mobile phone number, device numbers and identifiers, web addresses of the sites you come from and go to next, screen recordings, cursor movements, screen interactions and clicks, browser and operating system information, platform type, connection speed and other attributes. We may derive the general area you are in and the internet service provider you are using from the IP address you use.  
    
    How our network and your devices are working
    
    We monitor the condition of our networks, including Fios Internet Wi-Fi, such as traffic flow, speed, capacity, power, quality and environmental conditions such as nearby Wi-Fi access points. We may also collect test information from or take pictures of equipment we install or repair.
    
    Some Verizon wireless devices include system apps we provide to:
    
    * collect information about network and device conditions including location, battery life and apps on the device.
    * automatically install or update apps or device software when you activate your device, during certain operating system upgrades and with your consent at later times, for example, when you request an app from an advertisement or over the phone. The software collects information when an app it places is first opened or is uninstalled and may update Verizon apps or the apps that it installed. It also may send you notifications about Verizon and third-party offers and promotions that may interest you and about apps on your device that you have not yet used. You can use your device app controls to disable notifications from Verizon App Manager to opt out of these messages.
    
    Some apps installed or updated on your device in this way do not appear as icons on your device screen because of their limited utility. For example, they might facilitate the download of apps you select for your device, update apps you already have on your device, or report to an app owner that an app has been opened on the device. You can see and also delete or disable apps installed on your device, whether or not they have visible icons, using your device’s Application Manager under Settings. Apps on your device are governed by their own terms and privacy policies.
    
    Location of your wireless devices
    
    We collect cell tower location information. Based on what you have allowed, we may also collect Wi-Fi, Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) and other location information, for example, through Verizon apps you use  
    
    Business customers may have contracts with us that include privacy provisions that are specific to that relationship and differ from what you find here. Your contract will govern in those cases. 
    
    ### We also obtain information from others.
    
    This includes: 
    
    * [Credit information from outside agencies](#)
    * [Demographic and interest data](#) as well as device type, carrier, city and state information from third party data providers

    We obtain this information when you purchase products, apply for services, or when we pre qualify you for products or services.  
    
    Demographic and interest data
    
    For example, this information could include gender, age range, education level, sports enthusiast, frequent diner and other demographics and interests.  
    
    Information from social media platforms
    
    This includes information we obtain from your public profile as well as interests, "likes" and similar information you permit social media companies to share in this way.  
    
    Contact, marketing lead and other information we purchase or receive
    
    This includes lead information we receive from "refer a friend" and similar programs. It also includes landlord information when we need it for installing, repairing or maintaining equipment.

    This includes risk scores and related indicators we obtain from third party data providers to help us identify fraudulent transactions.

    information about your visits
    
    This applies to information we collect as part of providing broadband Internet access services to you.

    sites you visit and apps you use
    
    We use only the first part of the web addresses (URLs) you visit (the part that includes the top level domain and subdomain of the URL); we do not use information past the first “/” or “?” in the URL. We use this information and usage patterns within this information to determine interests, preferences and other insights we use in the program. 
    
    Our Custom Experience Plus program uses a broader set of information for the same purposes including information about sites you visit and apps you use, your Verizon Fios services, location information, and Customer Proprietary Network Information, including phone numbers you call or those that call you.

* [Does Verizon share my information?
    ----------------------------------
    
    We share information within our company, with vendors and partners, and as described in this section.](#acc-item-33)
    
    ### We share information within Verizon.
    
    We share information within Verizon, including with our affiliates, for a variety of purposes, including providing you with the latest information about our products and services and offering you our latest promotions. You can limit the sharing of [Customer Proprietary Network Information](#) and [certain credit information](#) if you do not want us to use them to market services to you that are different from the ones you have.
    
    Customer Proprietary Network Information
    
    Customer Proprietary Network Information (or CPNI) is information that relates to the type, quantity, destination, technical configuration, location, amount of use and related billing information of your telecommunications or interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services. Federal law governs our use and sharing of CPNI.  
    
    certain credit information
    
    Credit information includes your credit score, information in your consumer reports, and your account history.  
    
    ### We share information with service providers and partners.
    
    We use service providers to help us offer, provide, repair, restore and bill for services. We share information with them as necessary for them to perform work for us. They are required to protect information they receive from us or collect on our behalf and use it only for the purposes we allow.
    
    When you purchase or use services that are offered by Verizon and one of our partners, both parties may collect information about you. When this is the case, you should also review the partner company's privacy policy because it may describe uses of information that are different from ours.
    
    We share information about your devices’ 5G connectivity with mobile device operating system providers and app developers so that they can optimize your 5G experience. 
    
    We also share de-identified information with companies to assist with the delivery of advertising campaigns or aggregate reports.
    
    ### We share information about your activity on our websites and apps.
    
    We allow certain [third-party advertising companies](#) to collect information about your activity on our sites and in our apps and use that information to help us provide more relevant Verizon advertising on our own and other sites and apps. These companies may combine information from our sites with similar information they collect on other sites to determine whether you fit into an audience that advertisers, including Verizon, are trying to reach. 
    
    third-party advertising companies
    
    For example, ad servers, ad networks or technology platforms. We may deliver Verizon marketing on our sites and apps and on non-Verizon sites and apps, by our representatives, via mail or email or via other Verizon services or devices. 
    
    We and these companies use [cookies, pixels, tags, web beacons, scripts, application programming interfaces (APIs) or use similar technologies](https://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/cookies) on our pages and the browsers you use and may access advertising identifiers from your mobile device operating systems. 
    
    Our customers and website visitors can limit the sale and sharing of personal information as well as the use of this information for certain types of targeted advertising. California, Colorado, Connecticut and Virginia laws give consumers the right to make these opt out choices. California law also gives business customers the right to limit the sale and sharing of personal information.
    
    In addition, we require that advertising companies disclose when they are using interest-based advertising techniques to deliver ads on our sites and apps as well as when they deliver Verizon ads on other sites. We also require them to offer you the ability to opt out of this use of your information. 
    
    Verizon sites and services may also include social networks or other third-party plug-ins and widgets that may provide information to their associated social networks or third parties even if you do not click on or otherwise interact with the plug-ins and widgets. 
    
    Please visit the [Choices section](https://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/full-privacy-policy#acc-item-34) of this policy to learn how to opt out.

    We may publish your name, address and wireline telephone number(s) or provide this information to directory publishers, assistance services, or others. These companies can use this information in other formats or for other purposes, and they may make it available to others. We do not publish directories with wireless telephone numbers or make them available to others for listing in directories, unless you request that we do so.
    
    We also provide your name and wireline or wireless telephone number for Caller ID and similar services.
    
    ### We may disclose information in other situations.

    ### Our Business and Marketing Insights program helps companies understand consumer behaviors in aggregate.
    
    This program uses [Verizon and third-party information](#) to create aggregate [business and marketing insights](#). The information we use and the insights we develop do not identify you individually and may be shared with third parties.
    
    Verizon and third-party information
    
    This includes information about how you use your mobile device (such as web browsing, device location, and app/feature use), certain information about your Verizon products and services (such as device type and amount of use), and demographic and interest information you provide or we obtain from other companies (such as gender, age range and interests). We may also use point of interest and  location information we obtain from others as well as information provided by business and marketing clients who want insights related to their own businesses.
    
    Business and marketing insights
    
    Insights are observations about groups of people that can be used to better understand consumer actions. For example, we may create insights about the number of customers in different age groups who visit a website, use an app, or go to a retail store or stadium. We also can develop insights to help estimate traffic patterns about people who move from one area to another during the morning rush hour.
    
    ### Our Identity Verification Service helps protect you against fraud.
    
    We use certain Verizon Wireless account, device and profile data on behalf of companies with which you do business, for example, to help your bank confirm that you are calling rather than a fraudster, which may help protect you against theft and account takeover. Third parties that verify your identity are contractually required to protect the information and use it only for providing their verification services.

* [How does Verizon protect my information, and how do I update my account details?
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Learn about our information security and retention practices and how to update your account information.](#acc-item-35)
    
    ### Information security and retention.
    
    We use technical, administrative and physical safeguards to help protect against unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of information we collect or store. In addition, we train our employees on the importance of privacy and security, as well as the proper ways to access, use and disclose customer information. Our practices and policies prohibit employees with whom we share this information from using sensitive information unless they are authorized to do so and have a business need. 
    
    Our policies require that we retain records for as long as they are needed for legal, tax, audit, investigative, and/or security purposes and then securely delete or destroy them. We incorporate personal information into different types of records, not always by distinct data elements. For example, your name is part of your account, billing, technical support and call detail records.
    
    Although we strive to keep information secure, we can’t guarantee that our safeguards will prevent every unauthorized [attempt to access](#), use or disclose personal information. We use our security and incident response plans to handle such incidents. You can help secure your account using [advice, tips and tools we provide](https://www.verizon.com/about/responsibility/account-security).
    
    attempt to access
    
    For example, we have seen unauthorized attempts to access our customers' third party accounts, including accounts that customers have with financial institutions, email service providers or social media.  
    
    If you become aware of a security issue, please visit our page to [Report Security Vulnerabilities](https://www.verizon.com/solutions-and-services/report-security-vulnerability/) and follow the instructions to report your issue. We will work with you to address your concern. 
    
    ### Let’s work together to keep children safe.
    
    If you see content you believe to be related to child sexual abuse, or if you see any other illegal content involving children when using a Verizon service, report it by sending an email to abuse-csam@verizon.com and include the words “child sexual abuse material” in the subject line. You can also make a report directly to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children through their [CyberTipline.](http://www.missingkids.org/gethelpnow/cybertipline)
    
    ### Sharing information on blogs and social networks.
    
    Some of our websites, apps and services let you participate in discussions, message boards and chat rooms, or leave reviews. These are public spaces so your comments can be read, collected and shared by anyone. By sharing information in these forums, you are giving consent to the disclosure of this information.
    
    ### Accessing and updating your account information.
    
    Customers can review and update their account information in the following ways:
    
    **Verizon Wireline**

    You may have additional rights under the Cable Act.](#acc-item-1265)
    
    ### Information about the Cable Act
    
    The “Cable Act” (Section 631 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended) limits the collection and disclosure of personally identifiable information by cable operators and requires operators to tell you, to the extent that the Cable Act applies to the services you purchase, about the [personally identifiable information](#) they collect.
    
    Personally Identifiable Information
    
    Under the Cable Act, personally identifiable information does not include aggregate data that does not identify a particular person
    
     We may use our cable system to collect personally identifiable information necessary to render cable service or other services provided to you over the cable system and to detect and prevent unauthorized access to services. We may collect additional personally identifiable information with your prior consent. We may use or disclose personally identifiable information without consent where necessary to render services and to conduct legitimate business activities related to the services we provide.
    
    We may also disclose your name and address as long as you have the ability to prevent or limit this disclosure and the disclosure does not reveal, directly or indirectly, your viewing or other uses of the services we provide. We share name and address information with service providers as part of our Relevant TV advertising program. These providers work on our behalf to help our advertisers optimize their ads by preventing the same ads you see on Fios from being shown to you in other places. You can opt out of participating in the [Relevant TV advertising program](http://verizon.com/relevanttvfaqs). 
    
    We may also share personally identifiable information if it is required by law to comply with [valid legal process](#).
    
    Valid Legal Process
    
    We may disclose personally identifiable information to a governmental entity to comply with valid legal process, but we will not disclose records revealing your video programming unless we receive a court order indicating that the governmental entity has made a specified showing of relevance and you were afforded an opportunity to contest the order. We may be required to disclose personally identifiable information (including your video programming) to a non-governmental entity to comply with a court order, after you have been provided notice.
    
     We retain personally identifiable information only as long as reasonably necessary for business, accounting, tax or legal purposes. If you would like to access your personally identifiable information, you may [email us](mailto:privacyoffice@verizon.com?subject=Verizon%20Privacy%20Office) at [privacyoffice@verizon.com](mailto:privacyoffice@verizon.com?subject=Verizon%20Privacy%20Office) to arrange a time and convenient location to do so during business hours. If you believe any of your personally identifiable information is inaccurate, we will work with you to ensure that corrections are made.
    
    If you believe that your Cable Act privacy rights have been violated, please [email us](mailto:privacyoffice@verizon.com?subject=Privacy%20rights%20violation) at [privacyoffice@verizon.com](mailto:privacyoffice@verizon.com) and we will work with you to address your concerns. If you believe that you have been aggrieved as a result of a violation of the Cable Act, you may enforce the limitations imposed by the Cable Act through a civil action in a United States district court seeking damages, attorney's fees, and litigation costs. Other rights and remedies may also be available to you under federal or other applicable laws.

Some of the information we collect is considered [sensitive personal information under California law](#).

    * Genetic, biometric and health information, for example, some Verizon apps allow you to share health information with your trusted or emergency contacts. Another Verizon service uses voice recognition technology to allow you to secure your Verizon accounts. 
    
    And other information that may identify, relate to, describe, or is capable of being associated with you, for example, in limited circumstances, we may collect your insurance policy number if it is needed for processing damage claims.
    
    We use the information we collect for [business and commercial purposes](#) as they are defined by the CCPA. [Service providers we use to do work on our behalf](#) may use information for the same purposes.

    Service providers we use to do work on our behalf
    
    We share information with service providers as necessary for them to perform work for us. We share with them (including in the last twelve months), the information they need to perform that work. This includes personal information about you, for example, we share contact information with service providers who help us send Verizon marketing campaigns and device information to other service providers who help us monitor our network and provide technical support. Service providers are required to protect the information we share with them or they collect on our behalf and use it only for the specific purposes that we allow.

    Our policies require that we retain records containing personal information for as long as they are needed for legal, tax, audit, investigative, and/or security purposes and then securely delete or destroy them. We incorporate personal information into different types of records; it is not always retained by distinct data elements. For example, your name is part of your account, billing, technical support and call detail records.
    
    **You have the right to access, delete and correct information.** You can request access to specific pieces and categories of personal information we collect by using our [Privacy Dashboard](https://www.verizon.com/privacy/your-data) and following the instructions there, or by calling 1-800-333-3972.

You can use this same contact information to request that we delete personal information we have about you [unless we need it for specific reasons](#), and to correct inaccurate personal information we have about you. 
    
    unless we need it for specific reasons
    
    The law describes these reasons to include: needing the information to provide the services you have requested and other activities needed to maintain an ongoing business relationship or perform a contract with you, to maintain information security, to exercise legal rights and to comply with other laws.
    
    **You have a right to inform us that you do not want your personal information sold or shared.** California law defines “sale or sharing” broadly to include sharing personal information for monetary or other valuable consideration and the sharing of your information for cross contextual advertising purposes. This definition does not cover all sharing of personal information. We do not knowingly sell or share personal information related to children under 16 years of age. 
    
    We engage in online selling or sharing when we share information with advertising technology companies present on our websites who combine that information with information they collect about your visits to other sites or that they otherwise have about you to provide more personalized advertising to you. This occurs through the use of cookies, pixels, tags and similar technologies.

    reasons specified in the law
    
    These reasons include: detecting security incidents; resisting malicious, deceptive, fraudulent or illegal actions; ensuring the physical safety of a person; short-term, transient uses; performing services such as maintaining or servicing accounts, providing customer service, fulfilling orders and transactions; verifying your information; and verifying, maintaining or enhancing a service on a device that is owned manufactured or controlled by us or on your device.
