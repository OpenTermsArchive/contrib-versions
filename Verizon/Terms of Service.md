PTS is offered as a "best efforts" service and without warranty except as specifically set forth in this Agreement. We reserve the right to refuse to troubleshoot software not on our list of supported products.  
              
            
        5.  You understand and agree that technical problems may be the result of software or hardware errors not yet resolved by the product manufacturer, and that we may not have the ability to obtain the information necessary to resolve a specific technical problem.  
              
            
        6.  If you purchase the Thirty (30) Minute Premium Technical Support Service ("30 Minute PTS"), the Service is non-refundable. 30 Minute PTS has a maximum duration of thirty (30) minutes and must be used within twenty-four (24) hours from the time of purchase. and you must be a subscriber to Verizon High Speed Internet or Verizon FiOS Internet service.  
              
            
    3.  **Your Responsibilities.  
          
        **
        1.  In order for us to provide PTS, you must first confirm that you have: a) full access (including any required licenses) to the hardware and/or software that is the basis of the problem. and (b) completed a back-up of any data, software, information or other files stored on your computer disks and/or drives that may be impacted. **Verizon is not responsible for the loss, corruption or alteration of data, software or files that may result from performance of PTS by our technicians.** You also acknowledge and agree that you are the owner or authorized user of any hardware or software about which you are contacting us. PTS is only available to you and those residing at your location. PTS is not transferrable.  
              
            
        2.  You agree to cooperate with and follow instructions provided by Verizon and acknowledge that such cooperation by you is essential to our delivery of PTS to you.  
              
            
        3.  You hereby grant Verizon permission to view, access and modify your computer, computer (including registry) settings and any related software or peripheral equipment, including all data, hardware and software components, in order to perform PTS.  
              
            
        4.  You are responsible for any and all restoration and reconstruction of lost or altered files, data, or programs, and for ensuring that any information or data disclosed to Verizon is not confidential or proprietary to you or any third party.  
              
            
    4.  **Support Procedures.  
          
        **
        1.  Purchase Terms. PTS can be purchased either: (a) for an unlimited number of Incidents for a term beginning on the date you order PTS and continuing for the duration of the plan you selected ("Term Plan"). or (b) on a per-Incident basis (the "Per-Incident Service Plan"). For the Per-Incident Service Plan, Verizon will address a single Incident (as defined in Section 6.4.2 below) which shall include follow-up calls, as reasonable and necessary, regarding the Incident. Once an Incident is resolved (as set forth in Section 6.4.3, below), you may call back and obtain assistance on the same Incident for up to seventy-two (72) hours at no additional charge, after which the Incident will be considered closed. Once an Incident has been closed by Verizon, any further calls or requests for assistance will be considered a new Incident and additional fees will apply if you subscribe to our Per-Incident Service Plan. IF YOU PURCHASE PTS UNDER A TERM PLAN AND YOUR SERVICE IS TERMINATED BY YOU (OR BY US IF YOU BREACH THIS AGREEMENT) BEFORE COMPLETING YOUR TERM, THEN, UPON TERMINATION OF YOUR SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO PAY VERIZON AN EARLY TERMINATION FEE IN THE AMOUNT SET FORTH IN THE PLAN YOU HAVE CHOSEN.  
              
            
        2.  "Incident" means a specific, discrete problem for which Verizon will attempt to isolate its origin to a single cause. Verizon, in its sole discretion, will determine what constitutes an Incident.  
              
            
        3.  An Incident will be considered resolved when you receive one of the following: (a) information or advice that resolves the Incident. (b) information on how to obtain a software solution that will resolve the Incident. (c) notice that the Incident is caused by a known, unresolved issue or an incompatibility issue. (d) information that the Incident can be resolved by upgrading to a newer release of a product. (e) notice that the Incident has been identified as a hardware equipment issue. or if (f) you cannot, or elect not to, pursue the course of action we recommend.  
              
            
        4.  Our advice to you may include steps that you will need to take before the Incident can be resolved, such as buying cables or cords, acquiring software, etc. and we will keep your service request open for future reference when you are ready to resume the process.  
              
            
    5.  **Third Party Warranties.** Third-party equipment, software and peripheral products are covered by the warranties provided by the original manufacturer or the seller of the product. Third party warranties may vary from product to product. It is your responsibility to consult the applicable product documentation for specific warranty information. **In addition, you acknowledge that certain third party equipment or software warranties may limit or void the remedies that they offer if unauthorized persons perform support service on the equipment or software. It is your responsibility to ensure that any impact that Verizon's delivery of PTS might have on third party warranties is acceptable to you.**  
          
        
    6.  **Customer Specific Service.** PTS is only available to you and to persons you authorize. In either case, the terms of this Agreement will apply to the PTS services we perform.  
          
        
    7.  **LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. VERIZON'S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF THE PTS SERVICE, OR FROM VERIZON'S NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER ACTS OR OMISSIONS, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED, AT VERIZON'S SOLE DISCRETION AND OPTION, (A) TO REPERFORMING THE PTS SERVICE, OR (B) AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 12 OF THE AGREEMENT. EXCEPT THAT, IN THE CASE OF PER-INCIDENT SERVICE PLANS, YOUR REMEDIES WILL BE LIMITED TO A REFUND OF THE CHARGES AND FEES PAID FOR THE PTS SERVICE GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM, IF ANY. THE REMEDIES FOR A FAILURE OR BREACH OF SUCH LIMITED WARRANTY ARE EXCLUSIVE.**
