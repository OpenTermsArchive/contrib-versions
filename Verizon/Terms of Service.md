Privacy policy: Legal compliance
--------------------------------

Verizon's Privacy Policy at /about/privacy-policy/ (the "Privacy Policy") governs your use of the Sites and it is incorporated in these Terms by reference. The Privacy Policy explains, among other things, what information is gathered from visitors to the Sites, how it is used and retained, and ways visitors can restrict the use or disclosure of information we collect. Through your use of the Sites you consent to the collection and use of the information that you submit through the Sites, subject to the terms of our Privacy Policy. Verizon reserves the right to provide account and user information, including email, to third parties as required or permitted by law (such as in response to a subpoena or court order), and to cooperate with law enforcement authorities in the investigation of any criminal or civil matter. Such cooperation may include, but is not limited to, monitoring of the Verizon network consistent with applicable law. In addition, Verizon is required by law to report any facts or circumstances reported to us or that we discover from which it appears there may be a violation of the child pornography laws. We reserve the right to report any such information, including the identity of users, account information, images and other facts to law enforcement personnel. Information you provide to a third party Web site is governed by that Web site's terms and policies and these Terms or our Privacy Policy.

Limitations on use: Unmoderated areas and third-party links
-----------------------------------------------------------

You acknowledge and agree that Verizon (a) is not responsible for invalid destinations or transmission errors; and (b) does not guarantee your ability to access all Sites or Resources or that the Resources are secure or will meet your needs.

You understand and agree that Verizon (and its third party suppliers and licensors (collectively "Licensors")) have no control over third party networks or web sites that you may access in the course of your use of the Sites. The inclusion of any linked sites or content from the Sites does not imply endorsement of the linked site or content by Verizon. In no event shall Verizon or Licensors be liable to anyone for any damage arising from or caused, directly or indirectly, by the creation or use of a third party's web site, or the information or material accessed through such web sites. Access to any of the third party Web sites linked to from any of the Sites is entirely at your own risk and is solely governed by the terms and policies applicable to third party Web sites, and not these Terms. Accordingly, you should carefully review the privacy and other policies and terms of such third party web sites. In addition, certain areas of the Sites may contain Content from other users, and Verizon and its Licensors assume no responsibility for the accuracy, quality, or value of any content, data, documents, graphics, images, information, advice, or opinion contained in any emails, message boards, chat rooms or similar Services reflecting user-generated content, and we do not endorse any advice or opinion contained therein. You acknowledge that through your use of certain areas of the Sites, you may have access to Content or information which may be sexually explicit, obscene or offensive, or otherwise unsuitable for children. You agree that the supervision of use of the Sites by children is your responsibility and that Verizon and its Licensors are not responsible for access by you or any other users to objectionable or offensive content. VERIZON STRONGLY RECOMMENDS THE USE OF COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE CONTENT FILTERING SOFTWARE. You agree that your use of the Sites and the Internet, without limitation, is your sole responsibility, is solely at your own risk and is subject to all applicable local, state, n tional and international laws and regulations.

Acceptable use
--------------

If the use of a Site or Resource by you or anyone using your account, in Verizon's sole discretion, violates these Terms or any other Verizon agreement or policy, is objectionable or unlawful, or interferes with, disrupts or degrades the functioning or use of the Internet or the Verizon network by Verizon or other users then, without limiting any other right or remedy Verizon may have, Verizon may suspend, deny or restrict your access to any Site or Resource (and to take any other action Verizon deems appropriate to protect Verizon, our users and other Internet users). Without limiting the general policy stated above, you agree not to use the Sites (including by linking to the Sites), or any Resources, in any manner that:

1.  is unlawful, harmful to minors, threatening, harassing, abusive, defamatory, slanderous, fraudulent, gratuitously violent, obscene, deceptive, pornographic, libelous, invasive of another's privacy, or racially, ethnically or otherwise offensive, hateful or abusive;
2.  infringes or misappropriates Verizon's or a third party's intellectual property, confidentiality, or other rights;
3.  advocates or solicits violence, criminal conduct or the violation of law or the rights of any third party;
4.  distributes advertising or promotional content;
5.  compiles, uses, downloads or otherwise copies any user information and/or usage information (whether or not such information constitutes personally identifiable information), or that impermissibly transmits, provides or otherwise distributes such information to any third party;

7.  decompiles, disassembles, uses reverse engineering or otherwise attempts to derive the source code for the computer systems and other technology that operate the any of the Sites or that is available through the Sites;
8.  accesses (or attempts to access) any of the Resources by any means other than through the interface that is provided by Verizon. You specifically agree not to access (or attempt to access) any of the Resources through any automated script or routine, including "robots," "spiders," "offline readers," bots, web crawlers or other means, that accesses the Resources in a manner that sends more request messages to servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional online web browser;
9.  interferes with or disrupts the Resources (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Resources), whether via malicious software or otherwise; and/or
10.  reproduces, duplicates, redisplays, frames, makes copies of, or resells the Resources for any purpose.

Additional access and use restrictions may appear elsewhere on the Sites. In particular, forums, blogs or similar community-focused Sites or Resources may attach their own standards of conduct as is appropriate for the intended audience. You agree to abide by such additional restrictions. The Sites are intended solely for your private and personal use on your computer. Any other use or any attempt to use the Sites or Resources for commercial or other purposes is strictly prohibited.

By transmitting, uploading, posting or submitting any Creative Submissions, you hereby grant to Verizon an irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, unrestricted license to use, distribute, make, exploit, practice, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, publicly perform, and publicly display, and authorize others to do so, all such Creative Submissions in any manner whatsoever, in any medium now known or later developed, without compensation, attribution or any obligation to you or to any other person or entity. You agree that Verizon is not under any obligation of confidentiality or restriction, express or implied, with respect to the Creative Submissions or other feedback.

The license rights that you grant to Verizon with respect to such submitted software applications will be solely as contained in an applicable separate agreement with Verizon, or in separate license terms reflected in or references by the Site or Resource allowing for such submission.

International and export issues
-------------------------------

Changes to the sites and these terms
------------------------------------

All information posted on the site is subject to change without notice and Verizon reserves the right and sole discretion to change, limit, terminate, modify at any time, temporarily or permanently cease to provide the Sites or any part thereof to any user or group of users, without prior notice and for any reason or no reason. Verizon reserves the right, from time to time, to amend or change these Terms (including any of the policies which may be applicable to your use of the Sites) by posting such revisions to the page located in this section (or successor web site).

You agree that these Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, and any legal action or proceeding between Verizon and you for any purpose concerning these Terms shall be brought exclusively in a federal or state court of competent jurisdiction sitting in New York.
