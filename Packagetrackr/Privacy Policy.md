Like most web-based services, we collect non-personally-identifying information that web browsers and servers typically make available. This includes information like language preference, referring site, the browser type, and the date and time of each visitor request.

From time to time, we may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Service.

We also collect some potentially personally-identifying information. This includes information that web browser and servers typically make available like IP addresses. In addition, Some visitors to our website and users of the Service choose to interact in ways that require the collection of personally-identifying information. For example, we ask visitors who create an account to provide an email address. We do not disclose any of this potentially personally-identifying or personally-identifying information other than as described below. Visitors and users can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain activities or using certain features that are part of the Service.

We disclose potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on our behalf or to provide services available as part of the Service, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country. by using the Service, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. We will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, We disclose potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or our rights, third parties or the public at large.
