    Every company has its terms. These are ours.
    

1\. Our service
---------------

*   Pinterest helps you discover and do what you love. To do that, we show you things we think will be relevant, interesting and personal to you based on your onsite and offsite activity. To provide our Service, we need to be able to identify you and your interests. Some of the things we show you are promoted by advertisers. As part of our service we try to ensure that even promoted content is relevant and interesting to you. You can identify promoted content because it will be clearly labelled.
