Priority Plan Service Level Agreement
=====================================

This Service Level Agreement (“SLA”) sets the measures against which Starlink guarantees its Service performance and establish the remedies and mechanism by which you may be compensated by Starlink should Starlink fail to achieve the SLA guarantees. This SLA forms part of your Agreement with Starlink and may be subject to change at Starlink’s sole discretion, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, with changes taking effect at the beginning of the monthly billing period following notification from Starlink of any changes to the SLA.

1.  #### MECHANICS AND COMPENSATION.
    
    1.  **Measurement Period**. Starlink will measure any metric guaranteed by the SLA over the course of each monthly billing period for each service line. Measurement shall only occur within each monthly billing period and not over a continuous or rolling period. If the SLA is added in the middle of a monthly billing period, remedies for Outage Time will only be available for the period during which the SLA was active on the service line. To calculate Network Availability when the SLA is added in the middle of a monthly billing period, the total time in the monthly billing period will be used and not just the portion of the month during which the SLA was active.
        
    2.  **Compensation for SLA Violation**. Starlink will determine, in its sole discretion on the basis of the methods of calculation specified in Section 2, when an SLA violation has occurred (“SLA Violation”). **If any SLA Violation occurs with respect to a service line, Starlink will apply a credit against future Service payments (“Service Credit”) to your Starlink account equal to 20% of the base cost of the service line for the monthly billing period in which the SLA Violation occurred**. In the case of a service line with multiple Kits, the amount credited for each failing Kit will be 20% of the total recurring Service payments for that service line divided by the number of Kits on that service line. You agree that this Service Credit shall be your sole and exclusive remedy for any failure by Starlink to meet its obligations under this SLA. If a service line is active on multiple Service plans during the monthly billing period, compensation for an SLA Violation will be pro-rated according to the portion of the billing period spent on each Service plan. Service Credits will be issued within 30 days of the end of the month in which the SLA Violation occurred. **All Service Credits expire 24 months after the date of purchase or issuance, unless otherwise specified in the Order**. In the event of termination of the Agreement, unused Service Credits are refundable for up to 24 months after the date of purchase or issuance.
        
    3.  **Availability of SLA**. The SLA is available on a per-line basis for any Starlink Local Priority or Global Priority plans described in the [Service Plan Descriptions](https://starlink.com/legal/documents/DOC-1728-44881-79). SLA coverage is limited to Kits registered and used in cells marked as Available on the Starlink website. This SLA does _not_ apply to (i) Mini Kits or (ii) Data Pools.
        
2.  #### NETWORK AVAILABILITY GUARANTEE.
    
    1.  **Service Level Guarantee**. For service lines with an SLA applied, Starlink guarantees **99.9% Network Availability** (meaning, an Outage Time not to exceed 0.1% of the measurement period) over each monthly billing period (calculated as specified in this SLA).
        
    2.  **Measurement Methodology**. While it is powered and in active use, Starlink will measure whether your Kit is able to connect to a Starlink Point of Presence every second. Should this check fail continuously for at least 60 seconds, this period plus every additional second until your Kit successfully reconnects to the Starlink Point of Presence will count as “**Outage Time**” for the current monthly billing period. If the Outage Time as a percentage of the total time in the monthly billing period exceeds the maximum Outage Time guaranteed in Section 2.1, an **SLA Violation** will be deemed to have occurred. The Kit automatically detects Outage Time. Outage Time can be viewed in your Starlink account. If you believe Outage Time was not detected by the Kit and is not reflected in your account, you must submit a support ticket within 14 days of the date of the Outage Time. The support ticket must include the precise time period (UTC) and nature of the outage. Starlink will review the support ticket and if valid, will record the Outage Time in question to be included in calculation of Network Availability.
        
    3.  **Exclusions and Limitations**. Outage Time as specified in Section 2.1 shall not count towards an SLA Violation if any of the following are true at the time of the outage, as determined by Starlink in its reasonable discretion:
        
    
    *   The Kits or Services were used in ways that do not comply with the Service Terms, Service plans or Starlink policies.
    *   The Kit is not installed in accordance with the install guidelines provided by Starlink, including but not limited to the Starlink Enterprise Readme and instructions provided in the box and/or on Starlink.com.
    *   The Kit has not maintained a clear, unobstructed view of the sky at all times, which includes when using the Kit in motion.
    *   The Kit experiences a disruption to Service caused by you or third parties, including, but not limited to, as a result of radio interference, physical obstructions, unstable power supply to the Kit, or your network configuration on non-Starlink devices.
    *   The Kit is in Sleep Mode.
    *   The Kit is performing a device reboot for regular software lifecycle management purposes.
    *   The Kit is providing rate limited Service as a result of data allowance having been exceeded.
    *   The Outage Time is caused by a force majeure event or Act of God preventing Starlink from providing Service to your Kit and/or other essential network components.
    *   The Kit is in a country where Starlink does not provide Service.
    *   The physical tilt of the Kit is in excess of 20 degrees (applies only to Performance Kit).
    *   The Kit is misaligned more than 5 degrees from the recommended alignment (does not apply to Performance Kit).
