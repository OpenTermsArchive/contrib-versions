2.  #### How Do We Collect Your Personal Information?
    
    We may collect your personal information from the following sources:
    
    *   **Directly from You** – For example, if you register for an account, or request or purchase products, services, or information from us.
        
    *   **From Third Parties** – For example, we may work with business partners, subcontractors, advertising networks, analytics providers, and search information providers, who may provide us with personal information about you.
        
    *   **Through Cookies and Other Online Tracking Technologies** – We and our service providers operating on our behalf collect information about your activity, or activity on devices associated with you, on our Site and applications, using tracking technologies such as cookies, Flash cookies, pixels, tags, software development kids, application program interfaces, device identifiers and web beacons. Additional information about tracking technologies and their uses can be found at: [http://www.Cookiepro.com](http://www.cookiepro.com/). This tracking data may be used for several different purposes, including to:
        
        *   Provide useful features to simplify your experience when you return to our Site and applications (e.g., remembering your shipping information for future product purchases);
        *   Deliver relevant content and targeted advertising based on your preferences, service usage, and location;
        *   Monitor, evaluate and optimize the use and operation of our Site and applications; and

    *   We may, through cookies and other online tracking technologies, collect information whenever you are visiting our Site. We may do so regardless of whether you have a registered Starlink account or are logged in to that account, and we may associate this tracking data with your subscriber account (if you have one), in which case we will treat it as personal information. Service providers that collect tracking data on our behalf may provide an opportunity for you to choose not to be tracked online. The use of such tracking information by a third party depends on the privacy policy of that third party. We do not respond to Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals sent to us by your browser at this time.

    *   We do not advertise third-party products and services on our Site, but we do advertise Starlink services on third-party websites, social media platforms and other applications. Those third-party websites and applications may also collect information about your activity on our Site and applications, or devices associated with you. Tracking data collected by our advertising websites and platforms helps us determine what ads we may use on the platforms and helps us analyze improvements to our advertising strategy.

4.  #### With Whom Do We Share Personal Information?
    
    We may share your personal information with the following categories of people:
    
    *   **Our Service Providers:** We may share your personal information with our affiliates and service providers for the purposes we outline above. For example, we may rely on service providers to host and maintain our online services, perform backup and storage services, process payments, transmit communications, perform advertising or analytics services, and complete your privacy rights requests.

    As a Starlink customer, you may share information with third parties (for example, when you send an email or communicate with a third-party website).

5.  #### How Do We Protect Personal Information?
    
    We implement technological, physical and administrative procedures to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the personal information. We also encrypt information transmitted to and from your Starlink equipment, as well as train our employees on the importance of privacy and security.
    
    Although we endeavor to keep information secure, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use or disclose personal information. We maintain procedures to deal with any suspected breach of personal information, and we will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
