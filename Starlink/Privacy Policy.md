    We may collect your personal information from the following sources:
    
    *   **Directly from You** – For example, if you register for an account, or request or purchase products, services, or information from us.

Additional information about tracking technologies and their uses can be found at: [http://www.Cookiepro.com](http://www.cookiepro.com/). This tracking data may be used for several different purposes, including to:
        
        *   Provide useful features to simplify your experience when you return to our Site and applications (e.g., remembering your shipping information for future product purchases);

    We do not knowingly sell your information.
    
4.  #### With Whom Do We Share Personal Information?
    
    We may share your personal information with the following categories of people:
    
    *   **Our Service Providers:** We may share your personal information with our affiliates and service providers for the purposes we outline above. For example, we may rely on service providers to host and maintain our online services, perform backup and storage services, process payments, transmit communications, perform advertising or analytics services, and complete your privacy rights requests.
    *   **Government or Law Enforcement Agencies, Regulators, Professional Advisors, or Auditors:** Where required by applicable law, or as we deem necessary to protect any person from death or serious bodily injury, we may also transfer your personal information to government regulators or law enforcement agencies in response to requests from such entities.
    *   **Organizations Involved in Business Transfers:** If we sell, merge or reorganize our company, we expect that the personal information that we have collected will be transferred to the surviving or acquiring entity in accordance with applicable law.
    
    We may also share your personal information with third parties based on your request or written consent to do so.
    
    As a Starlink customer, you may share information with third parties (for example, when you send an email or communicate with a third-party website). In this context, we are not sharing personal information; you are using our Services to share data, and we are merely connecting you to the Internet.
    
5.  #### How Do We Protect Personal Information?
    
    We implement technological, physical and administrative procedures to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the personal information. We also encrypt information transmitted to and from your Starlink equipment, as well as train our employees on the importance of privacy and security.
    
    Although we endeavor to keep information secure, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use or disclose personal information. We maintain procedures to deal with any suspected breach of personal information, and we will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

3.  #### HOW DO WE PROTECT PERSONAL DATA IF WE TRANSFER IT INTERNATIONALLY?
    
    We may transfer your personal data to service providers and business partners outside of the EEA and/or UK.
    
    Some of these recipients are located in countries in respect of which either the European Commission and/or UK Government (as and where applicable) has issued adequacy decisions, in which case, the recipient’s country is recognized as providing an adequate level of data protection under UK and/or European data protection laws (as applicable) and the transfer is therefore permitted under GDPR Art. 45.
    
    Some recipients of your personal data may be located in countries outside of the EEA and/or the UK for which the European Commission or UK Government (as and where applicable) has not issued adequacy decisions in respect of the level of data protection in such countries (“Restricted Countries”). For example, the United States is a Restricted Country. Where we transfer your personal data to a recipient in a Restricted Country, we will either:
    
    *   enter into appropriate data transfer agreements based on so-called Standard Contractual Clauses approved from time-to-time under GDPR Art. 46 by the European Commission, the UK Information Commissioner’s Office or UK Government (as and where applicable); or
    *   rely on other appropriate means permitted by GDPR Chapter V, which establish that such recipients will provide an adequate level of data protection and that appropriate technical and organizational security measures are in place to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, and against all other unlawful forms of processing.
    
    You may ask for a copy of such appropriate data transfer agreements by contacting us using the contact details below.
    
4.  #### HOW LONG DO WE KEEP PERSONAL DATA?
    
    We will only keep personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for. We may keep your personal data for a longer period to comply with our legal obligations or in the event of a complaint or litigation.
    
5.  #### YOUR RIGHTS
    
    Regarding your personal data, you may have the right to:
    
    *   **Request access (commonly known as a "data subject access request")** - enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and information about how it is processed.
        
    *   **Request correction** - enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
        
    *   **Request erasure** - enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no lawful reason for us continuing to store or process it, where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons that will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
        
    *   **Object to processing** - where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation that makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.
        
    *   **Request restriction of processing** - enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data if, (i) you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (ii) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (iii) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
        
    *   **Request the transfer of your personal data** to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
        
    *   **Withdraw consent at any time** where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.
        
    
    To exercise these rights, please contact us using the contact details below. Although we urge you to contact us first to resolve your issue, you always have the right to contact your data protection authority.
    
6.  #### YOUR CHOICES
    
    You are not required to provide personal data to us but if you do not provide any personal data to us, you may not be able to use our website or we may not be able to authenticate and assist you with your orders, inquiries or requests, and we generally will not be able to provide you with our products and services.
