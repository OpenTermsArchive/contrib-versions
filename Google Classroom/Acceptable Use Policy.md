Abuse program policies and enforcement
======================================

The content policies listed below play an important role in maintaining a positive experience for everyone using Google products. We need to curb abuses that threaten our ability to provide these services, and we ask that everyone abide by the policies below to help us achieve this goal.

These policies apply to content when using Google Classroom with a personal Google Account. In addition, users should comply with the Google Privacy Policy and the terms of service and policies for G Suite services, including Google [Drive](https://support.google.com/drive/?hl=en#topic=2375072), [Docs](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/148505?rd=1), [Gmail](https://www.google.com/gmail/about/policy/) and [Calendar](https://support.google.com/calendar/?hl=en#topic=3417969). The policies apply to all Classroom features, including course names, information shared in the class stream, communications and collaboration between teachers and students, and class materials.

When applying these policies, we may make exceptions based on artistic, educational, documentary, or scientific considerations, or where there are other substantial benefits to the public from not taking action on the content. Be sure to check back from time to time, as these policies may change. Please also refer to Google’s [Terms of Service](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/) for more information.

Report abuse
------------

If you believe that someone is violating the policies found below, [report abuse](https://support.google.com/edu/classroom/answer/7299017). If you’re a G Suite user, contact your organization administrator to report a violation of these policies.

To report copyright infringement or other legal issues, please use [this tool](https://support.google.com/legal/troubleshooter/1114905?rd=2%23ts=1115681), which will guide you through the process of reporting content that you believe warrants removal from Google’s services based on applicable laws.

Program Policies
----------------

User accounts

Students cannot use Google Classroom at a school with a personal account. To use Classroom with students, schools must sign up for a free [G Suite for Education](https://www.google.com/edu/products/productivity-tools/#how-to) account. Individuals under 13 years of age may not use Classroom with personal accounts. Accordingly, course titles and content may not be directed at individuals below age 13 or suggest enrolling users under this age. If you believe a Classroom class is being used at a school with personal accounts, [report](https://support.google.com/edu/classroom/contact/reportclass) the class.

Spam, malware, and phishing

Do not exploit Google Classroom or use it for purposes other than organizing, communicating or collaborating for educational or Classroom purposes. Keep our product spam and malware free, and do not use our products for phishing. Spam includes, but is not limited to, unwanted promotional or commercial content and unwanted or mass solicitation. We also do not allow the transmission of malware, viruses, destructive code, or anything that may harm or interfere with the operation of the networks, servers, or other infrastructure of Google or others. Don’t use Classroom to trick, mislead, or deceive other users into sharing information under false pretenses. Refrain from soliciting or collecting sensitive data, including but not limited to passwords, financial details, and social security numbers.

Violence

Do not promote hate or incite violence, or post graphic or violent material for the sake of disgusting or shocking others. Graphic materials may be used to demonstrate a political or social viewpoint, such as with regards to animal abuse or war; however, be sure that you are not being gratuitously graphic. Additionally, speak your mind without threatening others. This means that you can publish a disagreement you may have with another person's ideas, but do not threaten to cause serious physical injury or death to that person, or rally support to physically harm others. In cases where there is a serious and imminent physical threat of injury or death, we may take action on the content.

Hate speech

We do not support content that promotes or condones violence against individuals or groups based on race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, nationality, veteran status, or sexual orientation/gender identity, or whose primary purpose is inciting hatred on the basis of these core characteristics. This can be a delicate balancing act, but if the primary purpose is to attack a protected group, the content crosses the line.

Terrorist content
-----------------

We do not permit terrorist organizations to use Google Classroom for any purpose, including recruitment. Classroom also strictly prohibits content related to terrorism, such as content that promotes terrorist acts, incites violence, or celebrates terrorist attacks. 

If posting content related to terrorism for an educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic purpose,  
be mindful to provide enough information so viewers understand the context.  

Harassment, bullying, and threats

Do not use Google Classroom to harass, intimidate, bully or threaten others, and do not incite others to engage in these activities. Anyone using our services to single someone out for malicious abuse, to threaten someone with serious harm, to sexualize a person in an unwanted way, or to harass in other ways may have the offending content removed or be permanently banned from using the service. In emergency situations, we may escalate imminent threats of serious harm to law enforcement. Keep in mind that online harassment is also illegal in many places and can have serious offline consequences for both the harasser and the victim.

Adult material

Do not publish sexually explicit or pornographic images or videos. Writing about adult topics is permitted as long as it is not accompanied by sexually explicit images or videos, or any material that promotes or depicts unlawful or inappropriate sexual acts with children or animals. Additionally, we do not allow content that drives traffic to commercial pornography. We do allow naturalistic and documentary depictions of nudity (such as an image of a breastfeeding infant), as well as depictions of nudity that serve a clear educational, scientific, or artistic purpose.

Child exploitation

Google has a zero-tolerance policy against child sexual abuse imagery. You may interact with minors on this platform, but please do not use this platform to interact with children in an effort that may exploit or abuse them, including physical, emotional or psychological harm. Do not upload or share content that exploits or abuses children. This includes all child sexual abuse imagery (even cartoon images) and all content that presents children in a sexual manner. This means that you cannot use our services to create, possess, or distribute child sexual abuse imagery, and you cannot use our services to create a gallery of children's pictures with sexually explicit commentary, for example. We will remove such content and take appropriate action, which may include disabling accounts and reporting to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) and law enforcement.

If you find any content that you think exploits children in this manner, do not comment on such content, even if your intent is to bring it to Google's attention. Instead, flag the content through the ['Report Abuse'](https://support.google.com/edu/classroom/answer/7299017) link. If you find content elsewhere on the internet, please contact [NCMEC](http://www.missingkids.com/home) directly.

Personal and confidential information

Do not share personal and confidential information. We do not allow unauthorized publishing of people's private and confidential information, such as credit card numbers, Social Security or other national ID numbers, drivers and other license numbers, account passwords, or any other information that is not publicly accessible. Keep in mind that in most cases, information that is already available elsewhere on the Internet or in public records is not considered to be private or confidential under our policies.

Additionally, do not post or distribute images or videos of minors without the necessary consent from their legal representatives. [Report a violation](https://support.google.com/drive/troubleshooter/6080141).

Illegal activities

Do not use Google Classroom to engage in illegal activities or promote content, activities or behavior that are dangerous and illegal. For instance, do not facilitate the promotion or sale of regulated or illegal drugs, human trafficking, escort services, or terrorism. If we are notified of unlawful activities, we will take appropriate action, which may include removing access to our product, your Google Account, or reporting you to the relevant authorities.

Copyright infringement

Respect copyright laws. Do not share copyrighted content without authorization or provide links to sites where people can obtain unauthorized downloads of copyrighted content. It is our policy to respond to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement. Repeated infringement of intellectual property rights, including copyright, will result in account termination. If you see a violation of Google's copyright policies, [report](https://support.google.com/edu/classroom/answer/7165963) copyright infringement.

**Note**: Translations of our policies are provided for your convenience. If there is a conflict between the text of this policy and the text of the English language version of the policy, the text of the English language version of the policy will take precedence.
