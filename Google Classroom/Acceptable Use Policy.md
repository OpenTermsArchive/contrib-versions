Abuse programme policies and enforcement
========================================

The programme policies listed below apply to content when using Google Classroom with a personal Google Account. This includes all Classroom features, such as course names, information shared in the class stream, communications and collaboration between teachers, students and class materials. The programme policies listed below play an important role in maintaining a positive experience for everyone using Google products. 

We need to curb abuse that threatens our ability to provide these services, and we ask that everyone abides by the policies below to help us achieve this goal. After we are notified of a potential policy violation, we may review the content and take action, including restricting access to the content, removing the content and limiting or terminating a user’s access to Google products.

When applying these policies, we may make exceptions based on educational, documentary, scientific or artistic considerations, or where there are other substantial benefits to the public from not taking action on the content. 

Make sure that you check back from time to time, as these policies may change. Please also refer to [Google’s Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en-GB), Privacy Policy and the terms of service and policies for Workspace services, including Google Drive, Docs, Gmail and Calendar.

Programme policies
------------------

Account hijacking

Do not access another user's account without their permission. We may take appropriate action if we are notified of account hijacking, which may include reporting you to the relevant authorities, removing access to some of our products or disabling your Google Account.

Child sexual abuse and endangerment

Do not create, upload or distribute content that exploits or abuses children. This includes all child sexual abuse materials. To report content on a Google product that may exploit a child, click '[Report abuse](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/2463296)'. If you find content elsewhere on the Internet, please contact [the appropriate agency in your country](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/148666) directly.

More broadly, Google prohibits the use of our products to endanger children. This includes but is not limited to, predatory behaviour towards children such as:

*   ‘Child grooming’ (for example, befriending a child online to facilitate, either online or offline, sexual contact and/or exchanging sexual imagery with that child);
*   ‘Sextortion’ (for example, threatening or blackmailing a child by using real or alleged access to a child’s intimate images);
*   Sexualisation of a minor (for example, imagery that depicts, encourages or promotes the sexual abuse of children or the portrayal of children in a manner that could result in the sexual exploitation of children); and
*   Trafficking of a child (for example, advertising or solicitation of a child for commercial sexual exploitation).

We will remove such content and take appropriate action, which may include reporting to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, limiting access to product features and disabling accounts. If you believe that a child is in danger of or has been subject to abuse, exploitation or trafficking, contact the police immediately. If you have already made a report to the police and still need help or you have concerns that a child is or was being endangered on our products, you can [report the behaviour to Google](https://support.google.com/families/contact/report_child_grooming).

Circumvention

Do not engage in actions intended to bypass our policies or subvert restrictions placed on your account. This includes the creation or use of multiple accounts or other methods intended to engage in behaviour that was previously prohibited. We may take appropriate action if we are notified of circumvention, which may include reporting you to the relevant authorities, removing access to some of our products or disabling your Google Account.

Dangerous and illegal activities

Do not use this product to engage in illegal activities or to promote activities, goods, services or information that cause serious and immediate harm to people or animals. While we permit general information about this content for educational, documentary, scientific or artistic purposes, we draw the line when the content directly facilitates harm or encourages illegal activity. We will take appropriate action if we are notified of unlawful activities, which may include reporting you to the relevant authorities, removing access to some of our products or disabling your Google Account.

Harassment, bullying and threats

Don't harass, bully or threaten others. We also don’t allow this product to be used to engage or incite others in these activities. This includes singling someone out for malicious abuse, threatening someone with serious harm, sexualising someone in an unwanted way, exposing private information of someone else that could be used to carry out threats, disparaging or belittling targets of violence or tragedy, inciting others to carry out these activities or harassing someone in other ways. Keep in mind that online harassment is illegal in many places and can have serious offline consequences for both the harasser and the target. We may take appropriate action if we are notified of threats of harm or other dangerous situations, which may include reporting you to the relevant authorities, removing access to some of our products or disabling your Google Account.

Hate speech

Do not engage in hate speech. Hate speech is content that promotes or condones violence against, or has the primary purpose of inciting hatred against, an individual or group on the basis of their race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, age, nationality, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or any other characteristic that is associated with systemic discrimination or marginalisation.

Impersonation and misrepresentation of identity

Do not impersonate a person or organisation or misrepresent yourself. This includes impersonating any person or organisation that you don’t represent or providing misleading information about a user/site’s identity, qualifications, ownership, purpose, products, services or business.

This also includes content or accounts misrepresenting or concealing their ownership or primary purpose such as misrepresenting or intentionally concealing your country of origin or other material details about yourself when directing content about politics, social issues or matters of public concern to users in a country other than your own. We do allow parody, satire and the use of pseudonyms or pen names – just avoid content that is likely to mislead your audience about your true identity.

Malware and similar malicious content

Do not transmit malware or any content that harms or interferes with the operation of the networks, servers, end user devices or other infrastructure. This includes the direct hosting, embedding or transmission of malware, viruses, destructive code, or other harmful or unwanted software or similar content. This also includes content that transmits viruses, causes pop-ups, attempts to install software without the user’s consent or otherwise impacts users with malicious code.

Misleading content

Do not distribute content that deceives, misleads or confuses users. This includes:

*   Misleading content related to civic and democratic processes: content that is demonstrably false and could significantly undermine participation or trust in civic or democratic processes. This includes information about public voting procedures, political candidate eligibility based on age or birthplace, election results, or census participation that contradicts official government records. It also includes incorrect claims that a political figure or government official has died, been involved in an accident or is suffering from a sudden serious illness
*   Misleading content related to harmful conspiracy theories: content that promotes or lends credibility to beliefs that individuals or groups are systematically committing acts that cause widespread harm. This content is contradicted by substantial evidence and has resulted in or incites violence.
*   Misleading content related to harmful health practices: misleading health or medical content that promotes or encourages others to engage in practices that may lead to serious physical or emotional harm to individuals, or serious public health harm.
*   Manipulated media: media that has been technically manipulated or doctored in a way that misleads users and may pose a serious risk of egregious harm.

Violence and gore

Do not store or distribute violent or gory content involving real-life people or animals that is primarily intended to be shocking, sensational or gratuitous.

Content may be allowed in an educational, documentary, scientific or artistic context, but please be mindful to provide enough information to help people understand the context. In some cases, content may be so violent or shocking that no amount of context will allow that content to remain on our platforms. Lastly, don't encourage others to commit specific acts of violence.
