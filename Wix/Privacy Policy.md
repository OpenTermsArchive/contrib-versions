-------------

Wix has implemented security measures designed to protect the Personal Information you share with us, including physical, electronic and procedural measures.

We encourage you to set strong passwords for your User Account and User Website, and avoid providing us or anyone with any sensitive Personal Information of which you believe its disclosure could cause you substantial or irreparable harm.

Furthermore, because certain areas on our Services are less secure than others (for example, if you set your Support forum ticket to be “Public” instead of “Private”, or if you browse to a non-SSL page), and since e-mail and instant messaging are not recognized as secure forms of communications, we request and encourage you not to share any Personal Information on any of these areas or via any of these methods.

We welcome all qualified job seekers to apply to any of our open positions, by sending us their contact details and CV.

We will use such Personal Information solely for our internal recruitment, employment and business purposes.

16\. Public forums and user content
-----------------------------------

Our Services offer publicly accessible blogs, communities and support forums. Please be aware that any Personal Information you provide in any such areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your Personal Information from our blogs, communities or forums, feel free to contact us [here](https://www.wix.com/support-chatbot?nodeId=kKKuIuXsiPa1kiePMmcA&_type=privacyGeneral&referral=privacyPolicy1). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information from such areas. For example, if you use a third party application to post a comment (e.g., the Facebook social plugin application) while logged in to your related profile with such third party, you must login into such application or contact its provider if you want to remove the Personal Information you posted on that platform. 

​

In any event, we advise against posting any Personal Information (via any means) you don’t wish to publicize.

​

If you upload any user content to your User Account or post it on your User Website and provide it in any other way as part of the use of any Service, you do so at your own risk.

We have put adequate security measures in place to protect your Personal Information.  However, we cannot control the actions of other Users or members of the public who may access your User Content, and are not responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures you or we may have placed on your User Website (including, for instance, password-protected areas on your User Website). You understand and acknowledge that, even after its removal by you or us, copies of User Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if any third parties (including any of your Users-of-Users) have copied or stored such User Content. To clarify, we advise against uploading or posting any information you do not wish to be public.

#### #ItsThatEasy

Avoid posting any Personal Information to any of the public areas on our Services, or to your own website, if you don’t want it to become publicly available.
