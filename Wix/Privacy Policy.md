We also regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and regularly seek new ways and Third Party Services for further enhancing the security of our Services and protection of our Visitors’ and Users’ privacy.

​

Regardless of the measures and efforts taken by Wix, we cannot and do not guarantee the absolute protection and security of your Personal Information, your Users-of-Users’ Personal Information or any other information you upload, publish or otherwise share with Wix or anyone else. We encourage you to set strong passwords for your User Account and User Website, and avoid providing us or anyone with any sensitive Personal Information of which you believe its disclosure could cause you substantial or irreparable harm.

Furthermore, because certain areas on our Services are less secure than others (for example, if you set your Support forum ticket to be “Public” instead of “Private”, or if you browse to a non-SSL page), and since e-mail and instant messaging are not recognized as secure forms of communications, we request and encourage you not to share any Personal Information on any of these areas or via any of these methods.

​

If you have any questions regarding the security of our Services, you are welcome to contact us [here](https://www.wix.com/support-chatbot?nodeId=kKKuIuXsiPa1kiePMmcA&type=privacySecurity&referral=privacyPolicy).

#### #ItsThatEasy

Wix values the security of our customers' Personal Information and we do everything in our power to protect it. 

However, as we can’t guarantee absolute protection – we encourage you to be careful, set a strong password for your account, and avoid submitting any sensitive information which, if exposed, could cause you major harm.

14\. Third-party websites
-------------------------

Our Services may contain links to other websites or services. We are not responsible for such websites’ or services’ privacy practices. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Services and to read the privacy statements of each and every website and service you visit before providing your Personal Information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to such linked third party websites and services.

We understand that privacy and discreetness are crucial to our Applicants, and are committed to keep Applicants Personal Information  private and use it solely for Wix’s internal recruitment purposes (including for identifying Applicants, evaluating their applications, making hiring and employment decisions, and contacting Applicants by phone or in writing).

​

If you previously submitted your Applicants Personal Information to Wix, and now wish to access it, update it or have it deleted from Wix’s systems, please contact us at [jobs@wix.com](mailto:jobs@wix.com).

16\. Public forums and user content
-----------------------------------

Our Services offer publicly accessible blogs, communities and support forums. Please be aware that any Personal Information you provide in any such areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your Personal Information from our blogs, communities or forums, feel free to contact us [here](https://www.wix.com/support-chatbot?nodeId=kKKuIuXsiPa1kiePMmcA&type=privacyRemovePI&referral=privacyPolicy). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information from such areas. For example, if you use a third party application to post a comment (e.g., the Facebook social plugin application) while logged in to your related profile with such third party, you must login into such application or contact its provider if you want to remove the Personal Information you posted on that platform. 

​

In any event, we advise against posting any Personal Information (via any means) you don’t wish to publicize.

​

If you upload any user content to your User Account or post it on your User Website and provide it in any other way as part of the use of any Service, you do so at your own risk.

We have put adequate security measures in place to protect your Personal Information.  However, we cannot control the actions of other Users or members of the public who may access your User Content, and are not responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures you or we may have placed on your User Website (including, for instance, password-protected areas on your User Website). You understand and acknowledge that, even after its removal by you or us, copies of User Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if any third parties (including any of your Users-of-Users) have copied or stored such User Content. To clarify, we advise against uploading or posting any information you do not wish to be public.

#### #ItsThatEasy

Avoid posting any Personal Information to any of the public areas on our Services, or to your own website, if you don’t want it to become publicly available.
