3\. Why do we collect such ‘Personal Information’
-------------------------------------------------

We use your Personal Information for the following purposes:

1. To provide and operate the Services;
    
2. .To further develop, customize, expand, and improve our Services, based on Users’ common or personal preferences, experiences and difficulties;
    
3. To provide our Users with ongoing customer assistance and technical support;
    
4. To be able to contact our Users with general or personalized service-related notices and promotional messages (as further detailed in [Section 8](https://www.wix.com/about/privacy) below);
    
5. To help us to update, expand and analyze our records to identify new customers;

4.How we share your Personal Information

4\. How we share your ‘Personal Information’
--------------------------------------------

We may share your Personal Information with service providers and others (or otherwise allow them access to it) in the following manners and instances:

Third Party Service Providers:  Wix has partnered with a number of selected service providers, whose services and solutions complement, facilitate and enhance our own. These include hosting and server co-location services, communications and content delivery networks (CDNs), data and cyber security services, billing and payment processing services, domain name registrars, fraud detection and prevention services, web analytics, e-mail distribution and monitoring services, session recording and remote access services, performance measurement, data optimization and marketing services, content providers, and our legal and financial advisors (collectively, “Third Party Service Provider(s)”).   
 

In case that Wix shares personal data with a Third Party Service Provider that provides AI services, Wix will ensure that the Third Party Service Provider is under a contractual obligation not to use the data in order to train or improve its AI models.​

4.1.

### #ItsThatEasy

We may share the Personal Information of our Users and Users-of-Users with various third parties, including certain service providers and law enforcement officials.

​

The Personal Information may be shared solely in accordance with this policy.

Law Enforcement, Legal Requests and Duties: Wix may disclose or otherwise allow access to any categories of your Personal Information described in this Privacy Policy pursuant to a legal request, such as a subpoena, legal proceedings, search warrant or court order, or in compliance with applicable laws, if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so, with or without notice to you.

4.2.

Protecting Rights and Safety:  Wix may share any categories of your Personal Information described in this Privacy Policy if we believe in good faith that this will help protect the rights, property or personal safety of Wix, any of our Users, any Users-of-Users, or any member of the general public, with or without notice to you.

4.3.

Wix Subsidiaries and Affiliated Companies: We may share your Personal Information internally within our family of companies, for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. For example, we may share your Personal Information with Wix.com Inc., our US-based subsidiary, in the course of facilitating and providing you (and your Users-of-Users) with our Services.  
Sharing Personal Information by Wix subsidiaries and affiliated companies in the European Union, the United Kingdom and Switzerland with Wix’s subsidiaries located outside these regions will only take place under an approved transfer mechanism, such as the relevant Standard Contractual Clauses.

4.4.

In connection with a change in corporate control: In addition, should Wix or any of its affiliates undergo any change in control, including by means of merger, acquisition or purchase of substantially all of its assets, your Personal Information may be shared with the parties involved in such event.

4.5.

Upon Your Further Direction: The Wix Services enable you, through different techniques, to engage and procure various third party services, products and tools for enhancing your web or mobile sites, including, without limitation, applications and widgets offered to you by third parties through the Wix Website (including the Wix App Market), eCommerce payment providers, third party designers who may assist you with your website, etc. (collectively, “Third Party Services”). If you choose to engage with such Third Party Services, they may have access to and process Personal Information of your Users-of-Users collected through your web or mobile sites. For example:

a) Framed Pages: our Services may enable you to integrate Third Party Services directly into your web or mobile sites, such as via page framing techniques to serve content to or from Third Party Services  or other parties (“Frames”). In these circumstances, the Third Party Services may collect Personal Information from your Users-of-Users.

b) App Market Developers: We allow third party developers (“Third Party Developer(s)”) to develop and offer their own applications via the Wix App Market (“Third Party App(s)”) to Users, which you may integrate into your web or mobile sites. Each Third Party Developer is bound by the Wix App Market Partner Agreement, which among other things, restricts the ways in which such developers may access, store, share, and use the Personal Information you and/or your Users-of-Users provide to them.

c) Social Media Features: Our Services may enable you to integrate certain Social Media features, widgets, and single sign on features, such as “Facebook Connect,” or “Google Sign-in” (“Social Media Features”) into your web or mobile sites. These Social Media Features may collect certain Personal Information from your Users-of-Users such as identifiers, including name, alias, unique personal identifier, online identifier, internet protocol address, email address, or other similar identifiers. Social Media Features are hosted either by a third party or directly on our Services.

Please note that in the examples listed above in this Section 4.6, Wix merely acts as an intermediary platform allowing you to procure the services of such Third Party Services (including, but not limited to, Third Party Developers, Third Party Apps and Social Media Features) with which you are interacting directly, and at your discretion. In this respect, Wix acts as a service provider to you, disclosing information to the Third Party Services on your behalf. Wix will share your Users-of-Users’ Personal Information with Third Parties Services only upon your direction or with your permission and is not, and shall not be, in any way responsible for such Third Party Services processing of such Personal Information, or liable with respect thereto.

Wix does not control and is not responsible for the actions or policies of any Third Party Service, and your use of any Third Party Service is at your own risk. We encourage you to review any privacy policy accompanying a Third Party Service and ask such Third Party Service for any clarifications you may need before deciding to install and/or use their services.

5.1.

User's personal information is controlled by Wix.com Ltd. in Israel, which the European Commission considers as a country offering an adequate level of protection for the Personal Information of E.U. Member State residents (see [here](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32011D0061)).

11\. Questions and Complaints

11\. Data retention
-------------------

We may retain your Personal Information (as well as your Users-of-Users’ Personal Information) for as long as your User Account is active, as indicated in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise needed to provide you with our Services.

​

We may continue to retain your Personal Information after you deactivate your User Account and/or cease to use any particular Services, as reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes regarding our Users or their Users-of-Users, prevent fraud and abuse, enforce our agreements and/or protect our legitimate interests.

​

To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of such data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of such data, the purposes for which we process it, and the applicable legal requirements.

### #ItsThatEasy

We may keep your Personal Information for as long as your account is active, and longer as needed (for example, if we are legally obligated to keep it longer, or need it to protect our interests).

12\. Data Retention

12\. Security
-------------

Wix has implemented security measures designed to protect the Personal Information you share with us, including physical, electronic and procedural measures. Among other things, we offer HTTPS secure access to most areas on our Services; the transmission of sensitive payment information (such as a credit card number) through our designated purchase forms is protected by an industry standard SSL/TLS encrypted connection; and we regularly maintain a PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards) certification. We also regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and regularly seek new ways and Third Party Services for further enhancing the security of our Services and protection of our Visitors’ and Users’ privacy.

​

Regardless of the measures and efforts taken by Wix, we cannot and do not guarantee the absolute protection and security of your Personal Information, your Users-of-Users’ Personal Information or any other information you upload, publish or otherwise share with Wix or anyone else. We encourage you to set strong passwords for your User Account and User Website, and avoid providing us or anyone with any sensitive Personal Information of which you believe its disclosure could cause you substantial or irreparable harm.

Furthermore, because certain areas on our Services are less secure than others (for example, if you set your Support forum ticket to be “Public” instead of “Private”, or if you browse to a non-SSL page), and since e-mail and instant messaging are not recognized as secure forms of communications, we request and encourage you not to share any Personal Information on any of these areas or via any of these methods.

​

If you have any questions regarding the security of our Services, you are welcome to contact us [here](https://www.wix.com/support-chatbot?nodeId=kKKuIuXsiPa1kiePMmcA&type=privacySecurity&referral=privacyPolicy).

Wix values the security of our customers' Personal Information and we do everything in our power to protect it.

-----------------------------------

Our Services offer publicly accessible blogs, communities and support forums. Please be aware that any Personal Information you provide in any such areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your Personal Information from our blogs, communities or forums, feel free to contact us [here](https://www.wix.com/support-chatbot?nodeId=kKKuIuXsiPa1kiePMmcA&type=privacyRemovePI&referral=privacyPolicy). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information from such areas. For example, if you use a third party application to post a comment (e.g., the Facebook social plugin application) while logged in to your related profile with such third party, you must login into such application or contact its provider if you want to remove the Personal Information you posted on that platform. 

​

In any event, we advise against posting any Personal Information (via any means) you don’t wish to publicize.

​

If you upload any user content to your User Account or post it on your User Website and provide it in any other way as part of the use of any Service, you do so at your own risk.

We have put adequate security measures in place to protect your Personal Information.  However, we cannot control the actions of other Users or members of the public who may access your User Content, and are not responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures you or we may have placed on your User Website (including, for instance, password-protected areas on your User Website). You understand and acknowledge that, even after its removal by you or us, copies of User Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if any third parties (including any of your Users-of-Users) have copied or stored such User Content. To clarify, we advise against uploading or posting any information you do not wish to be public.

### #ItsThatEasy

Avoid posting any Personal Information to any of the public areas on our Services, or to your own website, if you don’t want it to become publicly available.

Additional Information for U.S. State Residents
-----------------------------------------------

This section of our Privacy Policy details what Personal Information we collect about you under U.S. applicable privacy laws and regulations, the sources of the Personal Information, the purposes of use and disclosure, and the categories of third parties that may receive that Personal Information. The information in this section applies to you if you are a U.S. resident in a state with an applicable privacy law or regulation.

​

Please read this section in combination with the other sections of this Privacy Policy for a complete understanding of how we collect, use, and disclose your personal information.

### Your Rights and how to exercise them:

Here is a brief overview of your rights:  
 

* Right to Delete Your Information: Upon your request, we will delete the personal information we have collected from you, subject to certain legally permissible exceptions. 
    
    * Please follow the instructions provided in this Help Center article: <"[Permanently Deleting Your Wix Account](https://support.wix.com/en/article/privacy-permanently-deleting-your-wix-account-2888065)">, which explains how to delete your Personal Information. You can also choose to request the deletion through this  [web form](https://www.wix.com/account/support/permanent-delete) or by contacting us as described in this Privacy Policy.  
         
        
* Right to Know and Access Your Personal Information: You have the right to ask us to confirm whether we process your personal information and for a copy of the personal information we maintain about you.
    
    * Please follow the instructions provided in this Help Center article: <"[Retrieving Your Wix Account Data](https://support.wix.com/en/article/privacy-retrieving-your-wix-account-data)">, which explains how you can retrieve your Personal Information. You can also submit a request to access your Personal Information through this [web form](https://www.wix.com/account/support/get-archive) or by contacting us as described in this Privacy Policy

    * For any questions, you can reach out to us using the method described in this Privacy Policy  
         
        
* Right to Opt Out of the Sale of Your Personal Information: You can tell us not to "sell" your personal information according to applicable law, even though we don't technically sell your information in the traditional sense. We may share certain categories of Personal Information with our Third Party Service Providers. However,  the current regulation uses a very broad (and somewhat scary) definition of “Sale”."
    
* Right to Limit Use of Your Personal Information for Targeted Advertising (defined in California as “Sharing”): You can ask us not to use or disclose your personal information for targeted advertising. Just visit our [Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information page](https://www.wix.com/about/privacy/do-not-sell-my-personal-information). You also can use the Global Privacy Control to signal your opt-out preference. To learn more about the GPC please visit [https://globalprivacycontrol.org](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/).
    

  
  
You may exercise any of the rights described above, you can also submit a request by email to privacy@wix.com, or by mail to Wix.com, 5 Yunitsman St., Tel Aviv, Israel.  
  
When you submit a request, we will usually ask you to provide an email address to verify your identity and prevent fraud.  
  
You may also designate an authorized agent to submit a request on your behalf.   
Depending on the nature of the request, we may authenticate the request by requesting additional information or documentation, such as account related information, billing information used to purchase paid Services and the submission of specific documents.  
  
No Discrimination. Wix does not discriminate against any individual for exercising their rights under this section.  
  
If we deny your request or cannot fulfill it, you may appeal our decision by contacting us as described in this Privacy Policy to ask us to review your request again. Your communication should include “Appeal” in the subject line.
