Wix.com Terms of Use
====================

Last Revised: November 24, 2022

Welcome to Wix.com’s Terms of Use! We are truly excited to have you aboard. Thank you for choosing to use our services.

  
Below we have listed important legal terms that apply to anyone who visits our website or uses our services. These terms are necessary in order to protect both you and us and to make our services possible and more enjoyable for everyone. Wix offers a wide range of services and features and part of the terms below may not be relevant to the specific services you use.

​

We understand that legal terms can be exhausting to read, and we’ve tried to make the experience more pleasant. If you have suggestions on how we can improve them, you are welcome to [contact us](http://wix.com/contact?referral=termsofusecontact).

1\. Introduction
----------------

### 1.1. Our Purpose

Our services offer our Users (as defined below) the ability to easily create a beautiful and highly functional online presence, manage and promote businesses, content, and ideas, and have an overall great experience doing so – even without being tech-savvy or a design guru. As detailed below, we offer our users numerous tools and features for creating, publishing, and use of stunning websites, online e-commerce platforms, newsletters, galleries, media players, mobile apps, and other online and mobile applications, tools, and services. The online, and mobile websites, functionalities, and platforms created by Users are collectively referred to herein as “User Platform(s)”. 

#### #ItsThatEasy

### 1.2. Legal Agreement

These Wix.com Terms of Use (“Terms of Use”), together with such additional terms which specifically apply to some of our services and features as presented on the Wix.com website(s) (“Wix Website”, and collectively – the “Wix Terms”), set forth the entire terms and conditions applicable to each visitor or user (“User” or “you”) of the Wix Website, the Wix mobile application (the “Wix App”) and/or any other services, applications and features offered by us with respect thereto, except where we explicitly state otherwise (all services offered through the Wix Website or the Wix App, collectively – the “Wix Services” or “Services”). For the avoidance of doubt, Wix Services (as defined in these Terms of Use) do not include services, applications, features, or components that were built, developed, connected or offered by a Wix User, even if presented on the Wix Website or the Wix App.

The Wix Terms constitute a binding and enforceable legal contract between Wix.com Ltd. and its affiliated companies and subsidiaries worldwide (“Wix”, “us” or “we”) and you in relation to the use of any Wix Services - so please read them carefully.

You may visit and/or use the Wix Services and/or the Wix App only if you fully agree to the Wix Terms - and by using and/or registering to any of the Wix Services, you signify and affirm your informed consent to these Terms of Use and any other Wix Terms applicable to your use of any Wix Services. If you do not read, or fully understand or if you do not agree to the Wix Terms, you must immediately leave the Wix Website and avoid or discontinue all use of the Wix Services or Wix App.

​

By using our Services, you also acknowledge that you have read our Privacy Policy available at our [Privacy Policy](http://www.wix.com/about/privacy).

#### #ItsThatEasy

By visiting our website or using our application and/or services, you are entering into a legal agreement with us, consisting of these Terms of Use, and our additional services’ legal terms. By using our services, you signify your consent to these terms and you acknowledge that you have read our Privacy Policy. You may not use our services if you do not consent to all our terms.

### 1.3. User Account

In order to access and use the Wix Services, you must first register and create an account with Wix (“User Account”).

Creation of a User Account or purchase of Paid Services (as defined in Section 5 below), can be done either directly on the Wix Website or through an unrelated third-party authorized to sell Wix subscriptions to User Accounts and other Paid Services (a “Reseller”) under a separate agreement with Wix (a “Reseller Agreement”).

If you register to Wix Services or purchase Paid Services via a Reseller (referred to herein as a “Reseller User”) please note the following:

​

* These Terms of Use are applicable in addition to any arrangement by and between you and the Reseller, and they govern your use of the Wix Services.
    
* As between you and Wix,  per your relationship with Wix and unless otherwise specifically indicated in these Terms of Use, these Terms of Use supersede any arrangement between you and the Reseller with regard to your use of the Wix Services and/or activities in your User Account (or the User Account to which you are added).
    
* Certain services, applications, and features of the Wix Services may not be available to you or may only be available to you through the Reseller platform.  
    

### 1.4 Access to Accounts; Roles and Permissions

You may invite others to your User Account and your User Platforms and assign them certain roles and permissions to perform certain activities within your User Account and User Platforms. 

​

A person granted permission to perform activities on a User Account that such person does not own is referred to herein as a “Contributor”.

​

If anyone other than yourself (including Contributors) accesses your User Account and/or any of your User Platforms’ settings, they may also (and if done by a Contributors, depending on the roles and permissions you assign them), perform actions available to you (unless as specifically stated otherwise on the Wix Services), make changes to your User Platform(s) and User Account, and accept any legal terms available therein, make various representations and warranties and more – and all such activities will be deemed to have occurred on your behalf and in your name as the owner of the User Account, whether or not specifically authorized by you.

​

Therefore, we strongly encourage you to (i) keep the log-in credentials of your User Account confidential, and (ii) allow access to your User Account, only to people you trust - as you will be solely and fully responsible for all activities that occur under your User Account and/or User Platforms (including for any representations, warranties, and undertakings made therein and including by any Contributor), and for any damages, expenses or losses that may result from such activities.

​

You must provide accurate and complete information when registering your User Account and using Wix Services. We strongly encourage you to provide your own (or your company’s, as applicable) contact and billing details, including your valid e-mail address, as we may use it to identify and determine the actual and true owner of the User Account and/or User Content (as defined below) submitted to us.

​

If you are a Contributor,  you are required to register and create a User Account of your own in order to access the User Account under which you are a Contributor. Therefore these Terms of Use apply to Contributors as well.

​

If you are a Reseller User, then depending on the agreement between you and the Reseller, such Reseller may be the owner of the User Platform and you may be invited by the Reseller as a Contributor to such User Platform.

​

If you are invited as a Contributor to a User Platform or if you are a Reseller User, you acknowledge that the owner of such User Platform and /or the Reseller (ii) shall have full access to any information (including personal information) that is stored by you or on your behalf on such User Platform; and (ii) shall have all the rights and functionalities awarded to a User Account owner, in connection with such User Platform.

#### #ItsThatEasy

You can create an account and purchase services also via a third-party authorized to sell Wix (Reseller). If you register to Wix or purchase services via a Reseller you agree and accept these Wix terms of use (in addition to any arrangement between you and the Reseller), so that in you relationship with Wix these terms will overcome any other terms, and that some Wix services and features may not be available to you or be available to you only through the Reseller platform.

#### #ItsThatEasy

You can invite others (Contributors) to perform activities on your User Account by assigning them certain roles and permissions

​

If you are invited to be a Contributor on other User’s Platform , you need to create a User Account of your own before you access the other User Platform.   
  
If you are a Reseller User, the Reseller may be the owner of the User Platform and have access to information on such User Platform. The Reseller will also have all rights and functionalities awarded to a User Account owner. You may be invited by the Reseller as a Contributor to such User Platform.

###### 1\. 5 Account Ownership

For each User Platform, Wix will consider the owner of such User Platform to be the person or entity whose email address is listed in Wix’s records as the owner of the User Account under which the User Platform was created. 

​

In case of a dispute on User Account ownership, we reserve the right to determine ownership to a User Account based on our reasonable judgment, whether or not an independent investigation has been conducted by us. However, if we cannot make such a determination (as we may deem in our sole discretion), we reserve the right to avoid doing so and/or suspend a User Account until the parties disputing such ownership, reach a resolution, without Wix having any liability to you or to any other party. We may request documentation (e.g., government-issued ID, a business license) that may assist us in determining ownership.

​

If you created your User Account directly on the Wix Website (and not via a Reseller),  we may consider the principles set forth below to determine ownership.

​

If you are invited as a Contributor to a User Platform or if you are a Reseller User, you acknowledge that the owner of such User Platform and /or the Reseller (ii) shall have full access to any information (including personal information) that is stored by you or on your behalf on such User Platform; and (ii) shall have all the rights and functionalities awarded to a User Account owner, in connection with such User Platform.

​

1. Wix will consider the person or entity who has access to the e-mail address (listed in Wix’s records for a User Account under which such User Platform or User Content was created) as the owner of a User Account, User Platform, and/or User Content created and/or uploaded to the relevant Wix Service.
    
2. If any Paid Services were purchased via a User Account, Wix may consider the owner of such User Account and/or the relevant User Platform and/or User Content created thereunder, as the person or entity whose billing details were used to purchase such Paid Services (“Billing Information”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, when applicable, if a User Platform was connected to an external domain name (either imported or purchased as part of certain Paid Services, as defined below), and such domain’s registration information is publicly available via the WHOIS database provided on the [www.whois.net](https://www.whois.net/) website or on Wix’s database, Wix may consider the owner of such User Platform as the person or entity registered as the registrant of such domain thereunder. In the event that an individual and an organization are both registered as the registrant or the registrant organization of such a domain, Wix will consider the organization as the actual owner of the domain. In the event the Billing Information indicates one person as the owner of the User Platform and the domain registration indicates a different owner, Wix shall consider the person registered as the owner of the domain connected to the Wix Account as the owner of the User Platform.
    

​

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Wix shall have the right to determine the ownership of User Content and/or a User Website as it chooses, including by ignoring the indications set forth above, in the event Wix deems, at its sole discretion, that the situation justifies such determination, all based upon the factual situation as determined by the sole discretion of Wix.

​

If you are a Reseller User the ownership of the respective User Account may be determined by Wix pursuant to the terms of the Reseller Agreement.

#### #ItsThatEasy

To use certain of our services, you need to create a user account.  
  
You should keep your username and password protected and safe, and only allow people you trust to access your account or website settings.  
 

All activities that occur under your user account or website are your responsibility.

The account information you provide us must be your own (or your company’s), and be accurate and complete.  
  
When a user account is disputed, we may determine the ownership of such user account.

4. All Fees paid directly to Wix shall be deemed to be in U.S. Dollars, except as specifically stated otherwise in writing by Wix. To the extent permitted by law (and unless specified otherwise by Wix in writing), all Fees are exclusive of all taxes (including value-added tax, sales tax, goods and services tax, etc.), levies or duties imposed by taxing authorities (“Taxes”), and you shall be responsible for payment of all applicable Taxes relating to your use of the Wix Services, or to any payments or purchases made by you. If Wix is obligated to collect or pay Taxes for the Fees payable by you, and whether or not such Taxes were added and collected from you for previous transactions, such Taxes may be added to the payment of any outstanding Fees and will be reflected in the Invoice for such transaction. We recommend that you verify the existence of any additional fees you may be charged by third parties in connection with the purchase of Paid Services or in connection with the renewal thereof (such as international transaction fees, currency exchange fees, or fees due to banks or credit card companies).

#### #ItsThatEasy

Some of our services cost money. We will let you know how much beforehand Our prices are stated in U.S. Dollars and before taxes, unless otherwise said.

If needed, we or our affiliates may request and collect payments and related information from the relevant payment providers and banks.

If you are a Reseller User then payment and management of Paid Service might be conducted directly with the Reseller.

### 5.2. Invoices

If you are a Reseller User and you pay the Reseller and not directly to Wix, the following Section 5.2 does not apply to you.

​

Wix and/or its affiliated companies will issue an invoice or credit memo for any payment of Fees or refund made to or by Wix (“Invoice”). Each Invoice will be issued in electronic form and based on the country stated in your billing address and will be made available to you via your User Account and/or by e-mail. For the purpose of issuing the Invoice, you may be required to furnish certain Personal Information (as such term is defined in the Privacy Policy) in order to comply with local laws. Please note that the Invoice presented in your User Account may be inadequate with your local law requirements, and in such case may be used for pro forma purposes only. 

#### #ItsThatEasy

Invoices for our paid services will be available in your user account unless you’re a Reseller User. 

### 5.3. Subscription Auto-Renewals

1. In order to ensure that you do not experience any interruption or loss of services, certain Paid Services include an automatic renewal option by default, according to which, unless you [turn off](https://support.wix.com/en/article/turning-off-the-auto-renewal-for-a-wix-premium-plan/) the auto-renewal option is turned off by you or your Reseller, such Paid Services will automatically renew upon the end of the applicable subscription period, for a renewal period equal in time to the original subscription period (excluding extended periods) and, unless otherwise notified to you, (by Wix or your Reseller), at the same price (subject to applicable Taxes changes and excluding any discount or other promotional offer provided for the first period) (“Renewing Paid Services”). For example, if the original subscription period for a Service is one month, each of its renewal periods (where applicable) will be for one month. 
    
2. Accordingly, where applicable and as for Fees paid directly to Wix, Wix will attempt to automatically charge you the applicable Fees using the Stored Card, within up to two (2) weeks before such renewal period commences. In the event of failure to collect the Fees owed by you, we may in our sole discretion (but shall not be obligated to) retry to collect at a later time, and/or suspend or cancel your User Account, without further notice. If your Renewing Paid Service is subject to a yearly or multiple-year subscription period, Wix will endeavor to provide you a notice prior to the renewal of such Paid Service at least thirty (30) days in advance of the renewal date.
    
3. By entering into these Terms of Use and by purchasing a Renewing Paid Service, you acknowledge and agree that the Renewing Paid Service shall automatically renew in accordance with the above terms.
    
4. You (or the Reseller from which you purchase the Paid Services) may turn off the auto-renewal option for Renewing Paid Services at any time via your User Account or by visiting [Wix Help Center](https://www.wix.com/support/html5/article/canceling-a-wix-premium-plan/).
    
5. Certain domains are subject to a different renewal policy as detailed at [Web.com Reseller Domain Name Registration Agreement](https://www.wix.com/wix-platform/website-368/web/) and [Tucows Reseller Domain Name Registration Agreement](https://www.wix.com/wix-platform/website-368/tucows/), as applicable.
    
6. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, you are, and shall be, solely responsible to verify and ensure the successful renewal of the Wix Services you use (whether or not such Wix Services are subject to automatic subscription renewals). Accordingly, you shall be solely responsible with respect to any discontinuation of any Wix Services previously purchased by you, including due to a cancellation, failure to charge the applicable recurring Fees, or due to any Wix Services not being subject to automatic subscription renewals. You acknowledge and agree that you shall not have any claims against Wix in relation to the discontinuation of any Wix Services or Third Party Services, for whatever reason.
    

#### #ItsThatEasy

To make sure you don’t lose your domain or experience interruptions with your website at the end of your subscription period, we’ll automatically renew our service and bill you accordingly, in regular intervals as your initial subscription, unless you (or the Reseller you purchased the Paid Services from) turn-off auto-renewal.

Some services whether on purpose or mistake may not automatically renew. You should make sure that your subscriptions are renewed in time.

### 5.4. Money-Back Guarantee

#### #ItsThatEasy

If you are a Reseller User, and you pay the Reseller and not directly to Wix,  Section 5.4 does not apply to you.

​

1. If you are not happy with your initial purchase of a Premium Plan, you may provide notice of cancellation for any reason within fourteen (14) days of having first ordered or activated such Premium Plan (the “Refund” and “Refund Period”). The Refund is applicable only to the initial purchase of a Premium Plan which is an upgrade of a free website. The Refund is not applicable to any additional purchases, upgrades, modifications or renewals of Wix Services. If you reside in a jurisdiction that requires a longer Refund Period, we will accommodate such requirements in accordance with all applicable laws. If Wix receives such notice within the Refund Period, Wix will refund to you the amount Wix charged you for such Wix Services, in the currency you were originally charged in, and cancel the services accordingly. Please note that the Refund amount may be different than the amount you were charged due to currency changes and third-party fees. Wix will not be responsible for any differences caused by a change of currency exchange rates or fees you were charged by third parties. After the Refund Period, the Fees paid by you will be non-refundable and non-cancellable. In addition, if we find that a notice of cancellation has been given by a User in bad faith or in an illegitimate attempt to avoid payment for services actually received, we reserve our right to still charge the User for any Wix Services actually received, as permitted by the applicable law.
    
2. Please note: Certain services purchased on or through the Wix Services may be non-refundable altogether. These include Third Party Services such as domains, business tools and applications. The terms of each purchased service or application are indicated on the Wix Website and/or as part of or during the process of purchasing such services or applications. It is your responsibility to verify the ability to cancel a service prior to its purchase. Wix will not refund any amounts paid for non-refundable Paid Services, applications or Third Party Services.
    

We are happy to offer a 14-day money-back guarantee for our monthly or annual paid services when first purchased. This may be extended according to the law. If you are a Reseller User and pay the Reseller, this Section does not apply to you.  
  
Please carefully check the terms of each service before buying, since some services are non-refundable.

### 5.5. Chargebacks

If at any time, we record a decline, chargeback or other rejection of a charge of any payable Fees due directly to Wix, on your Wix account (“Chargeback”), this will be considered as a breach of your payment obligations hereunder, and your use of the Wix Services may be automatically disabled or terminated. 

​

In the event a Chargeback is performed, your User Account may be blocked without the option to re-purchase or re-use it, and any data contained in such User Account, including any domains, applications and Third Party Services may be subject to cancellation and Capacity Loss (as defined in Section 6.3 below). 

Your use of the Wix Services will not resume until you re-subscribe for any such Wix Services, and pay any applicable Fees in full, including any fees and expenses incurred by Wix and/or any Third Party Services for each Chargeback received (including Fees for Wix Services provided prior to the Chargeback, handling and processing charges and fees incurred by the payment processor).

If you have any questions or concerns regarding a payment made by you to Wix, we encourage you to first contact our Customer Support team before filing a Chargeback or reversal of payment, in order to prevent the Wix Services from being canceled and your User Account being blocked, and to avoid the filing of an unwarranted or erroneous Chargeback, which may result in your being liable for its applicable Fees, in addition to re-payment of all the Fees applicable to the Wix Services purchased (and charged-back) by you.

We reserve our right to dispute any Chargeback received, including by providing the relevant credit card company or financial institution with any information and documentation proving that the User responsible for such Chargeback did in fact authorize the transaction and received or made use of the services rendered thereafter.

#### #ItsThatEasy

Chargebacks may bring us to cancel your account, so we urge you to avoid causing them. Please contact our Customer Support team before filing a chargeback. You will be responsible for any incorrect fees, losses and expenses that follow.
