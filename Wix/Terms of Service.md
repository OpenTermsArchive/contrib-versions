1\. Introduction

The online and mobile websites and platforms created by Users are collectively referred to herein as (“User Platform(s)”). 

#### #ItsThatEasy

Wix.com offers online and mobile services and tools, that let create, manage and or/use your own online and mobile presence.

### 1.2. Legal Agreement

These Wix.com Terms of Use (“Terms of Use”), together with such additional terms which specifically apply to some of our services and features as presented on the Wix.com website(s) (“Wix Website”, and collectively – the “Wix Terms”), all set forth the entire terms and conditions applicable to each visitor or user (“User” our “you”) of the Wix Website, the Wix mobile application (the “Wix App”) and/or any other services, applications and features offered by us with respect thereto, except where we explicitly state otherwise (all services offered through the Wix Website or the Wix App, collectively – the “Wix Services” or “Services”).

The Wix Terms constitute a binding and enforceable legal contract between Wix.com Ltd. and its affiliated companies and subsidiaries worldwide (“Wix”, “us” or “we”) and you in relation to the use of any Wix Services - so please read them carefully.

You may visit and/or use the Wix Services and/or the Wix App only if you fully agree to the Wix Terms - and by using and/or registering to any of the Wix Services, you signify and affirm your informed consent to these Terms of Use and any other Wix Terms applicable to your use of any Wix Services. If you do not read, fully understand and agree to the Wix Terms, you must immediately leave the Wix Website and avoid or discontinue all use of the Wix Services.

​

By using our Services, you acknowledge that you have read our Privacy Policy available at [http://www.wix.com/about/privacy](http://www.wix.com/about/privacy) (“Privacy Policy”).

#### #ItsThatEasy

By visiting our website or using our application and/or services, you are entering into a legal agreement with us, consisting of these Terms of Use, and our additional services’ legal terms. 

By using our services, you signify your consent to these terms and you acknowledge that you have read our Privacy Policy. You may not use our services if you do not consent to all our terms.

### 1.3. User Account

In order to access and use certain sections and features of the Wix Services, you must first register and create an account with Wix (“User Account”).

If anyone other than yourself accesses your User Account and/or any of your User Platforms’ settings, they may perform any actions available to you (unless as specifically stated otherwise on the Wix Services), make changes to your User Platform(s) and User Account, and accept any legal terms available therein, make various representations and warranties and more – and all such activities will be deemed to have occurred on your behalf and in your name.

Therefore, we strongly encourage you to keep the log-in credentials of your User Account confidential, and allow such access only to people you trust - as you will be solely and fully responsible for all activities that occur under your User Account and/or User Platforms (including for any representations, warranties and undertakings made therein), whether or not specifically authorized by you, and for any damages, expenses or losses that may result from such activities.

You must provide accurate and complete information when registering your User Account and using the Wix Services, to which you are the sole and exclusive rights holder. We strongly encourage you to provide your own (or your company’s) contact and billing details, including your valid e-mail address, as we may use it to identify and determine the actual and true owner of the User Account and/or User Content (as defined below) submitted to us. 

In case of a dispute on User Account ownership, we reserve the right to determine ownership to a User Account based on our reasonable judgment, whether or not an independent investigation has been conducted by us. However, if we cannot make such determination (as we may deem in our sole discretion), we reserve the right to avoid doing so and/or suspend a User Account until the parties disputing such ownership, reach a resolution, without liability to you or to any other party. We may request documentation (e.g. government-issued ID, a business license) that may assist us in determining ownership. Among others, we may consider the principles set forth below.

​

1.  Wix will consider the owner of a User Account, User Platform and/or User Content created and/or uploaded to the relevant Wix Service, as the person or entity who has access to the e-mail address then listed in Wix’s records for such User Account under which such User Platform or User Content was created.
    
2.  If any Paid Services (as defined in Section 5 below) were purchased via a User Account, Wix will consider the owner of such User Account and/or the relevant User Platform and/or User Content created thereunder, may be considered to be the person or entity whose billing details were used to purchase such Paid Services (“Billing Information”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, when applicable if a User Platform was connected to an external domain name (either imported or purchased as part of certain Paid Services, as defined below), and such domain’s registration information is publicly available via the WHOIS database provided on the [www.whois.net](http://www.whois.net/) website or on Wix’s database, Wix will consider the owner of such User Platform as the person or entity registered as the registrant of such domain thereunder. In the event that an individual and an organization are both registered as the registrant or the registrant organization of such domain, Wix will consider the organization as the actual owner of the domain, and therefore as the owner of the User Platform connected to such domain. In event the Billing Information indicates one person as the owner of the User Platform and the domain registration indicates a different owner, Wix shall consider the person registered as the owner of the domain connected to the Wix Account as the owner of the User Platform.
    
3.  Notwithstanding the forgoing, Wix shall have the right to determine the ownership of User Content and/or a User Website as it chooses, including by ignoring the indications set forth above, in event Wix deems, at its sole discretion, that the situation justifies such determination, all based upon the factual situation as determined by Wix. 
    

#### #ItsThatEasy

To use certain of our services, you need to create a user account.  
  
You should keep your username and password protected and safe, and only allow people you trust to access your account or website settings.  
  
All activities that occur under your user account or website are your responsibility.

The account information you provide us must be your own (or your company’s), and be accurate and complete.

When a user account is disputed, we may determine the ownership of such user account.

----------------

### 5.1. Paid Services

The use of certain Wix Services may be subject to payment of particular fees, as determined by Wix in its sole discretion (“Paid Services” and “Fee(s)”, respectively). Wix will provide notice of such Fees then in effect in relation to such Paid Services. If you wish to receive or use such Paid Services, you are required to pay all applicable Fees in advance.

Wix reserves the right to change its Fees at any time, upon notice to you if such change may affect your existing subscriptions. If you received a discount or other promotional offer, Wix shall have the right to automatically and without notice renew your subscription to such Wix Service(s) at the full applicable Fee.

All Fees shall be deemed to be in U.S. Dollars, except as specifically stated otherwise in writing by Wix. To the extent permitted by law (and unless specified otherwise by Wix in writing), all Fees are exclusive of all taxes (including value added tax, sales tax, goods and services tax, etc.), levies or duties imposed by taxing authorities (“Taxes”), and you shall be responsible for payment of all applicable Taxes relating to your use of the Wix Services, or to any payments or purchases made by you. If Wix is obligated to collect or pay Taxes for the Fees payable by you, and whether or not such Taxes were added and collected from you for previous transactions, such Taxes may be added to the payment of any outstanding Fees and will be reflected in the Invoice for such transaction. We recommend that you verify the existence of any additional fees you may be charged by third parties in connection with the purchase of Paid Services or in connection with the renewal thereof (such as international transaction fees, currency exchange fees or fees due to banks or credit card companies). Wix is not responsible for any such additional fees or costs.

As part of registering or submitting information to receive Paid Services, you also authorize Wix (either directly or through its affiliates, subsidiaries or other third parties) to request and collect payment  and service fees (or otherwise charge, refund or take any other billing actions) from our payment provider or your designated banking account, and to make any inquiries Wix or its affiliates may consider necessary to validate your designated payment account or financial information, in order to ensure prompt payment, including for the purpose of receiving updated payment details from your payment, credit card or banking account provider (e.g., updated expiry date or card number as may be provided to us by your credit card company).

You must keep a credit card stored with Wix to pay for your Paid Services (“Stored Card”). You will be able to identify your Stored Card by its last four digits as in your Account Settings Page.

#### #ItsThatEasy

Some of our services cost money. We will let you know how much beforehand

Our prices are stated in U.S. Dollars and before taxes, unless otherwise said. 

If needed, we or our affiliates may request and collect payments and related information from the relevant payment providers and banks.

### 5.2. Invoices

Wix and/or its affiliated companies will issue an invoice or credit memo for any payment of Fees or refund made to or by Wix (“Invoice”). Each Invoice will be issued in electronic form and based on the country stated in your billing address, and will be made available to you via your User Account and/or by e-mail. For the purpose of issuing the Invoice, you may be required to furnish certain Personal Information (as such term is defined in the Privacy Policy) in order to comply with local laws. Please note that the Invoice presented in your User Account may be inadequate with your local law requirements, and in such case may be used for pro forma purposes only. 

#### #ItsThatEasy

Invoices for our paid services will be available in your user account. 

### 5.3. Subscription Auto-Renewals

In order to ensure that you do not experience any interruption or loss of services, certain Paid Services include an automatic renewal option by default, according to which, unless you [turn-off](https://support.wix.com/en/article/turning-off-the-auto-renewal-for-a-wix-premium-plan)  the auto-renewal option, such Paid Services will automatically renew upon the end of the applicable subscription period, for a renewal period equal in time to the original subscription period (excluding extended periods) and, unless otherwise notified to you, at the same price (subject to applicable Taxes changes and excluding any discount or other promotional offer provided for the first period) (“Renewing Paid Services”). For example, if the original subscription period for a Service is one month, each of its renewal periods (where applicable) will be for one month. Accordingly, where applicable, Wix will attempt to automatically charge you the applicable Fees using the Stored Card, within up-to two (2) weeks before such renewal period commences. In the event of failure to collect the Fees owed by you, we may in our sole discretion (but shall not be obligated to) retry to collect on a later time, and/or suspend or cancel your User Account, without further notice. If your Renewing Paid Service is subject to a yearly or multiple-year subscription period, Wix will endeavor to provide you a notice prior to the renewal of such Paid Service at least thirty (30) days in advance of the renewal date.

​

By entering into this Agreement and by purchasing a Renewing Paid Service, you acknowledge and agree that the Renewing Paid Service shall automatically renew in accordance with the above terms. 

​

You may turn-off the auto-renewal option for Renewing Paid Services at any time via your User Account or by visiting [Wix Help Center](https://www.wix.com/support/html5/article/canceling-a-wix-premium-plan).

Certain domains are subject to a different renewal policy as detailed in the [Domains Registration Agreement](http://www.wix.com/about/registration-agreement). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, you are and shall be solely responsible to verify and ensure the successful renewal of the Wix Services you use (whether or not such Wix Services are subject to automatic subscription renewals). Accordingly, you shall be solely responsible with respect to any discontinuation of any Wix Services previously purchased by you, including due to a cancellation, failure to charge the applicable recurring Fees, or due to any Wix Services not being subject to automatic subscription renewals. You acknowledge and agree that you shall not have any claims against Wix in relation to the discontinuation of any Wix Services or Third Party Services, for whatever reason.

#### #ItsThatEasy

To make sure you don’t lose your domain or experience

interruptions with your website at the end of your subscription period, we’ll automatically renew our service and bill you accordingly, in regular intervals as your initial subscription, unless you turn-off auto-renewal.

Some services whether on purpose or mistake may not automatically renew. You should make sure that your subscriptions are renewed in time.

### 5.4. Money-Back Guarantee

If you are not satisfied with Wix Services that are subject to a Fee for a period of service or subscription commitment and which is your initial purchase of such service, you may provide notice of cancellation for any reason within fourteen (14) days of having first ordered or activated such Wix Services (the “Refund” and “Refund Period”). The Refund is applicable only to the initial purchase of Wix services which is an upgrading of a free website by purchasing a Premium Plan (as offered on the Wix Website). The Refund is not applicable to any additional purchases, upgrades, modification or renewals of Wix Services. If you reside in a jurisdiction which requires a longer Refund Period, we will of course be happy to accommodate such requirements in accordance with all applicable laws. If Wix receives such notice within such Refund Period, Wix will refund to you the amount Wix charged you for such Wix Services, in currency you were originally charged in, and cancel them accordingly. Please note that the Refund amount may be different than the amount you were charged due to currency changes and third party fees. Wix will not be responsible for any differences caused by change of currency exchange rates or fees you were charged by third parties. After the Refund Period, the Fees paid by you are non-refundable and non-cancellable. In addition, if we find that a notice of cancellation has been given in bad faith or in an illegitimate attempt to avoid payment for services actually received and enjoyed, we reserve our right to still charge the User who provided such notice for any Wix Services actually received, as permitted by law.

Please note: Certain services purchased on or through the Wix Services may be non-refundable. These include Third Party Services such as domains, business tools and applications. The terms of each purchased service or application are indicated on the Wix Website and/or as part of or during the process of purchasing such services or applications. It is your obligation to verify your ability to cancel a service prior to purchasing it. Wix will not refund any amounts paid for non-refundable Paid Services, applications or Third Party Services. 

#### #ItsThatEasy

We are happy to offer a 14-day money-back guarantee for our monthly or annual paid services when first purchased. This may be extended according to the law.   
  
Please carefully check the terms of each service before buying, since some services are non-refundable.

### 5.5. Chargebacks

If, at any time, we record a decline, chargeback or other rejection of a charge of any payable Fees on your Wix account (“Chargeback”), this will be considered as a breach of your payment obligations hereunder, and your use of the Wix Services may be automatically disabled or terminated. 

In the event a Chargeback is performed, your User Account may be blocked without the option to re-purchase or re-use it, and any data contained in such User Account, including any domains, applications and Third Party Services may be subject to cancellation and Capacity Loss (as defined in Section 6.3 below). 

Your use of the Wix Services will not resume until you re-subscribe for any such Wix Services, and pay any applicable Fees in full, including any fees and expenses incurred by Wix and/or any Third Party Services for each Chargeback received (including Fees for Wix Services provided prior to the Chargeback, handling and processing charges and fees incurred by the payment processor).

If you have any questions or concerns regarding a payment made to Wix, we encourage you to first contact our Customer Support team before filing a Chargeback or reversal of payment, in order to prevent the Wix Services from being cancelled and your User Account being blocked, and to avoid the filing of an unwarranted or erroneous Chargeback, which may result in your being liable for its applicable Fees, in addition to re-payment of all the Fees applicable to the Wix Services purchased (and charged-back) by you.

We reserve our right to dispute any Chargeback received, including by providing the relevant credit card company or financial institution with any information and documentation proving that the User responsible for such Chargeback did in fact authorize the transaction and make use of the services rendered thereafter.

#### #ItsThatEasy

Chargebacks may bring us to cancel your account, so we urge you to avoid causing them.

Please contact our Customer Support team before filing a chargeback. You will be responsible for any incorrect fees, losses and expenses that follow.

6\. Cancellation
