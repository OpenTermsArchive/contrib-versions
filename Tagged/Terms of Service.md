### **L) Disputes**

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF. You and the Company agree that, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, you and the Company shall seek to resolve any and all disputes between the Company and you, respectively, including, without limitation, all claims, counter-claims and cross-claims (collectively, "Claims"), whether in law, equity or otherwise, solely through individual arbitration in accordance with the policies and procedures set forth in this Agreement. Such disputes shall include without limitation:

* disputes arising out of and/or otherwise relating to Company's Terms of Service, Content and Conduct Policy, and/or Privacy Policy;
    
* disputes arising out of and/or otherwise relating to any Services and/or any content on our Services;
    
* disputes arising out of and/or otherwise relating to any information, communications and/or other material that you and/or any other person and/or entity provide to and/or through the Services;
    
* disputes arising out of and/or otherwise relating to any information and/or other material that is collected, stored and/or disseminated by, on behalf of and/or with the approval of the Company;
    
* disputes arising out of and/or otherwise relating to any advertising and/or other communications by the Company in connection with the Services;
    
* disputes that are the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class;
    
* disputes that arose before you entered into this Agreement and/or any prior version of this Agreement;
    
* disputes that may arise after you terminate your registration with the Services; and
    
* disputes arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory.
    

Despite the language agreed to above and as an alternative to arbitration, either you and/or the Company may bring an individual action against the other in small claims court. Additionally, you and/or the Company may bring any Claim against the other to the attention of a federal, state and/or local government entity, which may elect to seek relief against the Company on your behalf, and/or against you on the Company's behalf.

You agree that you and the Company have voluntarily and intentionally waived any and all right to a trial by jury, and (except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement) any and all right to participate in a class action. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Dispute provision. This Dispute provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.

For you or the Company to initiate arbitration against the other party it must first send by certified mail to the other party a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice must identify and detail the nature of the party's Claim, the basis for that Claim, and the specific relief being sought for that Claim, including, without limitation, any Claim for injunctive relief. For the parties' convenience, a form for providing Notice is available at [http://www.tagged.com/disputeresolution\_forms.html](http://www.tagged.com/disputeresolution_forms.html) to download and complete. A Notice being sent to the Company must be addressed to: Dispute Resolution Department, The Meet Group, Inc., Attention: General Counsel, 100 Union Square Drive, New Hope, PA 18938 ("Company Notice Address"). A Notice being sent to you shall be sent to the e-mail address associated with your Services account and to any other e-mail address provided in your registration (collectively, "Member Notice Address"). You may also opt to receive a copy of any Notice via mail by sending a written request to the Company Notice Address including your name, postal address, Member Notice Address and Services User ID number (UID).

After receipt of the Notice you and the Company must attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute set forth in the Notice. If you and the Company are not able to resolve the dispute within 30 days after the Notice is received, then you or the Company may initiate an arbitration proceeding against the other by downloading and completing the "American Arbitration Association ("AAA") Consumer-Related-Disputes Form-California (For Use Only In California)" demand for arbitration form available at [Demand for Arbitration](https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer_Demand_for_Arbitration_Form_3.pdf) ("Demand"), and sending a copy of the Demand to the AAA, together with a copy of the Terms of Service and a check or money order payable to the AAA in the amount of the appropriate filing fee, and sending a copy of the Demand to the other party. The copy of the Demand being sent to the AAA must be addressed as stated on the Demand. A copy of the Demand being sent to the Company must be addressed to the Company Notice Address. A copy of the Demand being sent to you shall be addressed to the Member Notice Address.

Please note AAA does not provide the Company customer support and is only able to provide information regarding initiating an arbitration proceeding against the Company. All concerns regarding your account should be addressed to the Company by submitting a [Ticket](http://www.tagged.com/contact.html). The Company will try to resolve your concern, and in the case that you are not satisfied with the resolution you may choose to follow the process outlined on the [Dispute Resolution Page](http://www.tagged.com/disputeresolution.html).

Information regarding the appropriate filing fee to send with the Demand to the AAA (including the possible waiver of all or part of that fee) is available at [AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules](https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer_Fee_Schedule_2.pdf), or by calling AAA Customer Service at (800) 778-7879 or AAA Case Filing Services at (877) 495-4185. If you initiate an arbitration proceeding against the Company and are not able to pay all or part of the AAA filing fee (and do not receive a waiver of the unpayable amount), and so long as the total amount of the relief you are seeking in the Demand is $10,000 or less, then you may send a written request for payment of the unpayable amount to the Company at the Company Notice Address. The Company shall consider your request and will, in its own discretion, either (1) pay the unpayable amount to the AAA directly or (2) send notice to you of its denial of your request within 10 business days of the receipt thereof. Further, if you initiate an arbitration proceeding against the Company, and so long as the total amount of the relief you are seeking in the Demand is $10,000 or less, then you may send proof of your payment of all or part of the AAA filing fee to the Company at the Company Notice Address, and the Company shall reimburse you for that actually paid amount.

The arbitration shall be administered by the AAA and shall be governed by the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures and the AAA Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules"), as modified by this Agreement. The AAA Rules are available online at [AAA Consumer Arbitration](https://www.adr.org/consumer) and [Consumer Arbitration Rules](https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer-Rules-Web_0.pdf), or by calling AAA Customer Service at (800) 778-7879. (Additional information about the arbitration process, presented in a simplified FAQ format, is available at [http://www.tagged.com/disputeresolution.html](http://www.tagged.com/disputeresolution.html). The arbitrator selected to resolve the dispute between you and the Company shall bound by the terms of this Agreement. All arbitration hearings shall take place exclusively in San Francisco County, California. Except, however, that if the total amount of the relief you are seeking in the arbitration is $10,000 or less you may choose whether the arbitration shall be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephone hearing, or by an in-person hearing, as established by the AAA Rules. If the total amount you are seeking is greater than $10,000 then your and the Company's respective rights to an arbitration hearing shall be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which any award is based.

In addition to any reimbursement of AAA filing fees as detailed above, and so long as the total amount of the relief you are seeking in the arbitration is $10,000 or less, the Company shall pay all other AAA administration fees and all arbitrator fees for the arbitration. Except, however, that if the arbitrator in such action finds that either the substance of your dispute against the Company or the relief you are seeking in the arbitration is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees in such action shall be governed by the AAA Rules. In said event, you hereby agree to reimburse the Company for all monies paid by the Company that are your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Additionally, if the total amount of the relief you are seeking in the arbitration is greater than $10,000 then the payment of all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees shall be governed by the AAA Rules.

You and the Company agree that unless and until the arbitrator determines the monetary and/or other relief, if any, to which you and/or the Company is entitled in connection with the dispute being arbitrated, neither you nor the Company shall disclose to the arbitrator the amount of any settlement offer(s) that you and/or the Company previously made to the other in connection with said dispute. In any individual arbitration between you and the Company, if the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of the Company's last written settlement offer to you then the Company shall:

* pay you the amount of the award or $2,500 (the "Member Incentive"), whichever is greater; and
    
* pay your attorney, if any, twice the amount of any fees, and reimburse said attorney any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs), that said attorney reasonably and actually accrues in investigating, preparing and pursuing your Claim against the Company in the arbitration (collectively, the "Attorney Incentive").
    

However, if the Company did not make any written settlement offer to you prior to the arbitrator in said individual arbitration issuing you an award, then so long as the arbitrator awards you any monetary relief on the merits of your Claim against the Company, you and your attorney (if any) shall be entitled to receive the Member Incentive and the Attorney Incentive, respectively. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of any fees and/or expenses, the Member Incentive and/or the Attorney Incentive at any time during the individual arbitration and/or upon request by you and/or the Company made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits of said individual arbitration. The Attorney Incentive supplements and does not supersede any right you may have under applicable law to receive attorneys' fees and/or expenses in connection with the individual arbitration (including as may be awarded to you by the arbitrator), but in no event may you recover a duplicative award of attorneys' fees and/or expenses. If the Company prevails in an individual arbitration against you and is entitled under applicable law to receive attorneys' fees and/or expenses, the Company hereby agrees that it shall not seek and shall refuse to receive such an award.

The arbitrator may award any form of individual relief in your favor, but solely to the extent warranted by your individual Claim. You and the Company agree that, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, you and the Company may bring a Claim against the other solely in your or the Company's individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, and, except as otherwise set forth herein, no arbitrator may consolidate more than one person's Claim and/or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If all or part of this specific paragraph is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable after final appeal, then the entirety of this Dispute provision shall be deemed null and void.

AT ANY TIME AND IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION THE COMPANY MAY DIRECT THE AAA TO CONSOLIDATE ANY AND ALL PENDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION CLAIMS THAT (i) ARISE IN SUBSTANTIAL PART FROM THE SAME AND/OR RELATED TRANSACTIONS, EVENTS AND/OR OCCURRENCES, AND (ii) INVOLVE A COMMON QUESTION OF LAW AND/OR FACT WHICH, IF RESOLVED IN MULTIPLE INDIVIDUAL AND NON-CONSOLIDATED ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS, MAY RESULT IN CONFLICTING AND/OR INCONSISTENT RESULTS. IN SAID EVENT, YOU HEREBY CONSENT TO CONSOLIDATED ARBITRATION, IN LIEU OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, OF ANY AND ALL CLAIMS YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST THE COMPANY AND THE AAA RULES SET FORTH HEREIN SHALL GOVERN ALL PARTIES. Additionally, in said event, if the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Company's last written settlement offer to you then the Company shall:

* pay you the amount of the award or three times the amount of the Company's last written settlement offer to you (the "Member Incentive"), whichever is greater; and
    
* pay your attorney, if any, twice the amount of any fees, and reimburse said attorney any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs), that said attorney reasonably and actually accrues in investigating, preparing and pursuing your Claim against the Company in the arbitration (collectively, the "Attorney Incentive").
    

However, if the Company did not make any written settlement offer to you prior to the arbitrator in said consolidated arbitration issuing you an award, then so long as the arbitrator awards you any monetary relief on the merits of your Claim against the Company, then you shall be entitled to receive the award and/or $500, whichever is greater, and your attorney (if any) shall be entitled to receive the Attorney Incentive. As also noted above, the arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of any fees and/or expenses, the Member Incentive and/or the Attorney Incentive at any time during the consolidated arbitration and/or upon request by you and/or the Company made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits of said arbitration. Similarly, the Attorney Incentive supplements and does not supersede any right you may have under applicable law to receive attorneys' fees and/or expenses in connection with the consolidated arbitration (including as may be awarded to you by the arbitrator), but in no event may you recover a duplicative award of attorneys' fees and/or expenses. If the Company prevails in a consolidated arbitration against you and is entitled under applicable law to receive attorneys' fees and/or expenses, the Company hereby agrees that it shall not seek and shall refuse to receive such an award. If all or part of this specific paragraph is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable after final appeal, then the entirety of this Dispute provision shall be deemed null and void.

Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that if the Company changes this Disputes provision in the future (other than a change to the Company Notice Address and/or any Internet address, telephone number and/or document title set forth in this provision) you may reject that change by sending written notice within 30 days of the change to the Company at the Company Notice Address. By rejecting said change you reaffirm that you shall seek to resolve all disputes between you and the Company solely through arbitration in accordance with this Agreement.

If there is a dispute between participants on the Services, or any third party, the Company is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that Member has a dispute with one or more members, Member hereby releases the Company and its directors, officers, employees, agents, independent contractors, representatives, parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns and licensees from all claims, actions, losses, liabilities, judgments, damages, costs and expenses of every kind or nature (regardless of whether actual or consequential, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed), arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or any the Services. If Member is a California resident, Member hereby waives California Civil Code Section 1542, which says "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."

### **N) Termination**

Either party may terminate use of the Services with or without cause at any time and effective immediately upon written notice to the other party. The Company may terminate with or without cause at any time and effective immediately, at the Company's sole discretion, including but not limited to Member's failure to conform with these terms and conditions of the Agreement. the Company shall not be liable to Member or any third party for termination of use of the Services or Services. Member's right to use the Services shall cease immediately. Member shall have no right and the Company will have no obligation thereafter to forward any unread or unsent messages to Member or any third party. Sections G-N shall survive termination of the Agreement.

2.3. We also offer various services or features that are subject to a fee. Before you sign up to purchase such services or features, we will provide you with further information about what you will be purchasing, for example, where applicable: the main characteristics of the services or features, the term of your subscription (including any extension), how to terminate your subscription, the price and any payment conditions and limitations of means of payment. In case you purchase Virtual Goods (see Clause 3.3 below), we will further inform you that these are redeemable only on the Service for digital merchandise and content and that they are not refundable. If you want to upgrade your Basic Membership by choosing a membership that is subject to a fee ("Premium Membership"), or access any other services or features subject to a fee, you acknowledge that by pressing the "Buy now"-button (or comparable button), you will have confirmed that you want to purchase the Premium Membership or other services or features that you have selected.

Plantilla para el formulario de rescisión

**1\. Descripción del servicio**

1.1. Una vez que te hayas registrado para obtener una cuenta, te proporcionaremos acceso a una plataforma en línea a través de la cual podrás conocer a otros clientes registrados (también conocidos como miembros). Únicamente se puede acceder al Servicio a través de aplicaciones móviles en dispositivos iOS y Android (aunque, en el futuro, podrían estar disponibles otros sistemas operativos), o a través de nuestro sitio web Tagged y/o Hi5 (ten en cuenta que algunas funciones solo estarán disponibles a través de la aplicación móvil o la web); y el Servicio incluye algunos servicios que son gratuitos y otros que son de pago.

1.2. El Servicio contiene "perfiles" de miembros, que incluyen contenidos (también denominados "datos") puestos a disposición por dichos miembros. También puedes encontrar más detalles sobre los tipos de información personal que se recopilan y cómo se pone esta información a disposición de otros miembros en nuestra [Política de Privacidad](https://secure.tagged.com/terms_of_service.html?#privacy_policy) (consulta la Cláusula 5 más adelante). Ofrecemos nuestro Servicio globalmente; y es posible que nuestros miembros busquen y contacten a otros miembros en cualquiera de los países en los que operamos.

**2\. Acceso al servicio y conclusión de tu suscripción**

2.1. Para acceder al Servicio y usarlo, deberás registrarte. Para ello, tendrás que elegir una opción de registro disponible, como correo electrónico, SMS, Iniciar sesión con Apple, Iniciar sesión con Google o Facebook, y proporcionar credenciales de inicio de sesión, como dirección de correo electrónico y una contraseña de tu elección. Serás responsable de mantener la confidencialidad de tu contraseña y de las credenciales de tu cuenta. Además, serás responsable de todas y cada una de las actividades causadas culpablemente que se produzcan en tu cuenta. Te comprometes a notificarnos inmediatamente cualquier uso no autorizado de tu cuenta o cualquier otra violación de la seguridad en cuanto tengas conocimiento de ello.

2.2. Una vez que te hayas registrado correctamente, podrás acceder a nuestro Servicio gratuito ("Membresía Básica").

2.3. También ofrecemos varios servicios o funciones que están sujetos a una tarifa. Antes de que te registres para comprar dichos servicios o funciones, te proporcionaremos más información sobre lo que vas a comprar, por ejemplo, cuando proceda: las características principales de los servicios o funciones, el plazo de tu suscripción (incluida cualquier prórroga), cómo finalizar tu suscripción, el precio y cualquier condición de pago y limitaciones de los medios de pago. En caso de que adquieras Bienes Virtuales (consulta la Cláusula 3.3 más adelante), te informaremos además de que estos solo son canjeables en el Servicio por mercancías y contenidos digitales y que no son reembolsables. Si quieres mejorar tu Membresía Básica eligiendo una membresía de pago ("Membresía Premium"), o acceder a otros servicios o funciones de pago, reconoces que, al tocar el botón "Comprar ahora" (o un botón similar), habrás confirmado que quieres comprar la Membresía Premium u otros servicios o funciones que hayas seleccionado. Nuestra relación contractual para dichas compras se confirmará en la fecha en que recibas una confirmación de tu pedido. No obstante, ten en cuenta que el cumplimiento de tu obligación de pago con nosotros está sujeto a que el proveedor de servicios de pago correspondiente verifique y procese la compra.

2.4. También puedes realizar compras a través de nuestra aplicación para iOS de Apple o Android de Google. Esto incluye la compra de una Membresía Premium o de cualquier otro servicio o función sujetos a una tarifa. En este caso, seguimos siendo responsables de la prestación de nuestro Servicio. Recibirás una confirmación de pedido relativa a los Términos de Suscripción después de cualquier compra de este tipo. Sin embargo, cualquier compra y/o suscripción se concluye (y debe cancelarse o rescindirse) únicamente a través de Apple/Google (consulta la Cláusula 5.3), y está sujeta a las normas y principios técnicos establecidos por Apple/Google, sobre los que no tenemos ningún control. Por regla general, una compra a través de una tienda de aplicaciones tendrá lugar cuando hagas clic en "Comprar ahora" (o un botón similar) y, cuando sea necesario, introduzcas tu contraseña o credenciales equivalentes (por ejemplo, Touch ID o Face ID) para la tienda de aplicaciones. Tu relación contractual con Apple/Google quedará confirmada en la fecha en que Apple/Google te envíe un correo electrónico de confirmación de tu pedido; y Apple/Google te facturará cualquier cargo de Membresía Premium a través de tu cuenta de Apple/Google. También encontrarás en la App Store toda la información esencial que necesites sobre tu relación contractual con Apple/Google. Si adquieres una Membresía Premium a través de la App Store que está sujeta a prórroga automática, la Membresía Premium tendrá una duración determinada, que se prorrogará automáticamente a menos que canceles tu suscripción con Apple/Google de acuerdo con los Términos de Uso de Apple/Google. Ten en cuenta que las Cláusulas 5.3 y 12 de estos Términos de Uso no se aplicarán cuando hayas adquirido una Membresía Premium a través de Apple/ Google.

2.5. Consulta también las Cláusulas 14 y 15 para conocer los términos que se aplicarán si has descargado nuestra aplicación desde Apple o Google. Ten en cuenta también que, si has descargado nuestra aplicación desde la App Store de Apple/Google, se aplicarán los Términos de Uso de la App Store de Apple/Google, que prevalecerán sobre estos Términos de Uso en caso de conflicto.

6.9. Aunque trabajamos duro para proporcionar un servicio de alta calidad, no garantizamos que el Servicio funcione perfectamente en todo momento y no podemos asegurar que el Servicio sea siempre ininterrumpido, seguro o esté libre de errores. En particular, no somos responsables de las interrupciones que afecten a la accesibilidad del Servicio cuando dichas interrupciones estén causadas por acciones o acontecimientos que estén fuera de nuestro control. Además, aunque adoptaremos las medidas de seguridad técnicas y organizativas adecuadas para proteger tus datos personales, en la medida en que lo permita la ley, no seremos responsables de ningún acceso no autorizado por parte de terceros a tus datos personales (por ejemplo, debido a que piratas informáticos obtengan acceso no autorizado a nuestra base de datos), si esto no se debe a una acción u omisión culpable por nuestra parte, en particular, a no haber tomado todas las medidas de precaución necesarias para evitar cualquier infracción de las leyes aplicables.

b) Para todos los demás daños debidos al incumplimiento de obligaciones contractuales esenciales resultantes de una negligencia simple por nuestra parte, de nuestros representantes legales o auxiliares ejecutivos, nuestra responsabilidad se basará en el fondo del asunto. Las obligaciones contractuales esenciales (obligaciones cardinales) son aquellas cuyo cumplimiento permite la correcta ejecución del contrato en primer lugar y en cuyo cumplimiento puede confiar normalmente la parte contratante. En tales casos, seremos responsables de un importe de indemnización como el que sería típico por daños previsibles en un contrato de este tipo. Por lo demás, la responsabilidad queda excluida.

c) Las disposiciones anteriores no afectan a la responsabilidad en virtud de la ley alemana sobre responsabilidad por productos defectuosos.

6.11. Estás obligado a tomar las medidas adecuadas para prevenir y mitigar los daños, en particular para garantizar, siempre que sea técnicamente posible, la seguridad adecuada de tus datos en tus dispositivos.

Musterformular für den Widerruf

**1\. Leistungsbeschreibung**

1.1. Nachdem Sie sich für ein Konto angemeldet haben, erhalten Sie von uns Zugriff auf eine Online-Plattform, über die Sie andere registrierte Kunden (auch als Mitglieder bezeichnet) kennenlernen können. Der Zugriff auf den Service ist nur über Mobile Apps auf iOS- und Android-Geräten möglich (zukünftig möglicherweise auch über andere Betriebssysteme) bzw. über unsere Tagged- und/oder Hi5-Website (wir weisen darauf hin, dass bestimmte Funktionen nur über die Mobile App bzw. über das Internet verfügbar sind); und im Leistungsumfang sind sowohl kostenlose als auch kostenpflichtige Dienste inbegriffen.

1.2. Der Service enthält Mitglieder-„Profile“, in denen Inhalte enthalten sind (auch als „Daten“ bezeichnet), die von den betreffenden Mitgliedern bereitgestellt werden. Weitere Informationen zu den Arten personenbezogener Daten, die erfasst werden, und den Verfahren, mit denen diese Informationen anderen Mitgliedern zur Verfügung gestellt werden, entnehmen Sie auch unserer [Privacy Policy](https://secure.tagged.com/terms_of_service.html?#privacy_policy) (siehe den nachstehenden Abschnitt 5). Wir bieten unseren Service weltweit an; und unsere Mitglieder haben die Möglichkeit, in allen Ländern, in denen wir tätig sind, nach anderen Mitgliedern zu suchen und diese zu kontaktieren.

**2\. Zugriff auf den Service und Abschluss Ihres Abonnements**

2.1. Um auf den Service zugreifen und ihn nutzen zu können, müssen Sie sich registrieren. Dazu müssen Sie eine der verfügbaren Registrierungsoption auswählen, z. B. E-Mail, SMS, Mit Apple anmelden, Mit Google oder Facebook anmelden, und Anmeldeinformationen wie Ihre E-Mail-Adresse und ein von Ihnen gewähltes Passwort eingeben. Sie sind dafür verantwortlich, die Vertraulichkeit Ihres Passworts und Ihrer Kontoinformationen zu wahren. Ebenso sind Sie verantwortlich für sämtliche schuldhaft verursachten Aktivitäten, die im Namen Ihres Kontos stattfinden. Sie erklären sich damit einverstanden, uns unverzüglich über jede unbefugte Nutzung Ihres Kontos oder andere Sicherheitsverletzung zu informieren, sobald Sie davon Kenntnis erhalten.

2.2. Nach erfolgreicher Registrierung erhalten Sie Zugriff auf unseren kostenlosen Service („Basis-Mitgliedschaft“).

2.3. Darüber hinaus bieten wir verschiedene Dienste oder Funktionen an, für deren Nutzung eine Gebühr erhoben wird. Bevor Sie sich zum Kauf solcher Dienste oder Funktionen registrieren, stellen wir Ihnen weitere Informationen darüber bereit, welche Leistungen jeweils in Ihrem Kauf inbegriffen sind, zum Beispiel, sofern zutreffend: die Hauptmerkmale der Dienste oder Funktionen, die Laufzeit Ihres Abonnements (einschließlich etwaiger Verlängerungen), Hinweise zur Kündigung Ihres Abonnements, den Preis sowie alle geltenden Zahlungsbedingungen und Beschränkungen bezüglich der gültigen Zahlungsmittel. Beim Erwerb virtueller Güter (siehe den nachstehenden Abschnitt 3.3) informieren wir Sie ebenfalls darüber, dass diese nur im Rahmen des Service gegen digitale Waren und Inhalte eingelöst werden können und dass sie nicht erstattungsfähig sind. Wenn Sie ein Upgrade von Ihrer Basis-Mitgliedschaft auf eine kostenpflichtige Mitgliedschaft („Premium-Mitgliedschaft“) durchführen oder auf andere kostenpflichtige Dienste oder Funktionen zugreifen möchten, nehmen Sie zur Kenntnis, dass Sie durch Drücken der Schaltfläche „Jetzt kaufen“ (oder einer ähnlichen Schaltfläche) bestätigen, dass Sie die Premium-Mitgliedschaft oder andere Dienste oder Funktionen erwerben möchten, die Sie ausgewählt haben. Unser Vertragsverhältnis für solche Einkäufe wird mit dem Datum wirksam, an dem Sie eine Bestätigung Ihrer Bestellung erhalten. Wir weisen jedoch darauf hin, dass die Erfüllung Ihrer Zahlungsverpflichtung uns gegenüber der Überprüfung und Abwicklung des Kaufs durch den jeweiligen Zahlungsdienstleister unterliegt.

2.4. Sie können Einkäufe auch über unsere App für Apple iOS oder Google Android tätigen. Dies gilt auch für den Erwerb einer Premium-Mitgliedschaft oder anderer kostenpflichtiger Dienste oder Funktionen. In diesem Fall bleiben wir für die Bereitstellung unseres Dienstes verantwortlich. Nach einem solchen Kauf erhalten Sie eine Bestätigung Ihrer Abonnementbedingungen. Allerdings werden solche Käufe und/oder Abonnements ausschließlich über Apple/Google (siehe Abschnitt 5.3) abgeschlossen (und müssen über den betreffenden Anbieter storniert oder gekündigt werden) und unterliegen den technischen Standards und Grundsätzen von Apple/Google, auf die wir keinen Einfluss haben. In der Regel erfolgt ein Kauf über einen App Store, wenn Sie auf „Jetzt kaufen“ (oder eine ähnliche Schaltfläche) klicken und auf Aufforderung Ihr Passwort bzw. entsprechende Anmeldeinformationen (z. B. Touch ID oder Face ID) für den App Store eingeben. Ihr Vertragsverhältnis mit Apple/Google wird wirksam mit dem Datum, an dem Apple/Google Ihnen eine E-Mail-Bestätigung Ihrer Bestellung zusendet; und Apple/Google stellt Ihnen die Gebühren für eine Premium-Mitgliedschaft über Ihr Apple-/Google-Konto in Rechnung. Alle wichtigen Informationen, die Sie über Ihr Vertragsverhältnis mit Apple/Google benötigen, werden Ihnen ebenfalls im App Store bereitgestellt.

Wir weisen darauf hin, dass die Abschnitte 5.3 und 12 dieser Nutzungsbedingungen keine Gültigkeit haben, wenn Sie eine Premium-Mitgliedschaft über Apple/ Google erworben haben.

2.5. Bitte beachten Sie auch die nachstehenden Abschnitte 14 und 15 zu den jeweiligen Bedingungen, die gelten, wenn Sie unsere App über Apple oder Google heruntergeladen haben.

3.2. Sie haben die Möglichkeit, sich für ein Upgrade Ihrer Mitgliedschaft auf den Premium-Status („Premium-Mitgliedschaft“) zu entscheiden, für die eine zusätzliche monatliche Gebühr anfällt. Bei Erwerb einer Premium-Mitgliedschaft verlängert sich Ihre Mitgliedschaft automatisch auf monatlicher Basis.

3.3. Sie können „virtuelle Güter“ ausschließlich zur Nutzung im Rahmen des Service erwerben (z. B. virtuelles „Gold“). Käufe oder sonstige Formen des Erwerbs virtueller Güter berechtigen nur zu einer begrenzten, nicht übertragbaren, nicht unterlizenzierbaren, vollumfänglich widerrufbaren Lizenz zur Nutzung solcher virtuellen Güter für den Zugriff auf Dienste, die wir ausdrücklich zur privaten, nichtkommerziellen Nutzung in Verbindung mit solchen virtuellen Gütern zur Verfügung stellen (z. B. Live-Animationen, sog. virtuelle „Geschenke“). Virtuelle Güter können nur im Rahmen des Service gegen digitale Waren und Inhalte eingelöst werden. Virtuelle Güter verfallen nicht. Virtuelle Güter sind nicht erstattungsfähig. Virtuelle Güter haben keinen Geldwert und stellen keine Währung oder Eigentum jeglicher Art dar. Virtuelle Güter sind nicht übertragbar oder abtretbar. Sie haben keinen Anspruch auf Rückerstattung, Zahlung von Geldbeträgen oder eine andere Entschädigung für ungenutzte virtuelle Güter, wenn ein Konto aufgrund eines schwerwiegenden Verstoßes Ihrerseits gegen diese Nutzungsbedingungen geschlossen wird oder wenn Sie sich entscheiden, Ihr Konto zu schließen.

3.4. Sie können virtuelle Güter verwenden, um Geschenke für andere Benutzer unserer App oder anderer Apps zu kaufen, die Ihnen angezeigt werden. Der Preis für das jeweilige Geschenk wird beim Kauf angezeigt. Geschenke gewähren eine begrenzte Lizenz für den Zugriff auf eine bestimmte Funktion des Service.

3.6. Es steht uns frei, Änderungen an dem Service vorzunehmen: (i) um Änderungen der geltenden Gesetze und behördlichen Auflagen Rechnung zu tragen; oder (ii) um kleinere technische Anpassungen und Verbesserungen vorzunehmen, beispielsweise zur Abwehr einer Sicherheitsbedrohung (Ihre Nutzung des Service wird durch diese Änderungen jedoch nicht beeinträchtigt). Darüber hinaus veröffentlichen wir zwar eine Beschreibung unseres Service auf unserer Website, können jedoch die Hauptmerkmale des Service in unregelmäßigen Abständen ändern, ohne dass für Sie zusätzliche Kosten entstehen. In diesem Fall informieren wir Sie hierüber jedoch innerhalb einer angemessenen Frist vor Inkrafttreten einer derartigen Änderung, und es steht Ihnen dann frei, uns innerhalb von 30 Tagen, nachdem Sie über eine derartige Änderung informiert wurden, zu kontaktieren, um Ihr Abonnement zu kündigen, sofern die Änderung Ihren Zugriff auf die Dienste oder Ihre Nutzung der Dienste beeinträchtigt und sofern es sich nicht um eine geringfügige Beeinträchtigung handelt, die nur vor Inkrafttreten der Änderungen eintritt (und sofern Sie über uns eine Premium-Mitgliedschaft abonniert haben, erhalten Sie von uns eine anteilige Rückerstattung für Leistungen, die Sie bezahlt, jedoch wegen der vorzeitigen Kündigung Ihres Abonnements nicht erhalten haben). In jeder derartigen Mitteilung werden Sie über die Art und die Gründe für eine solche Änderung, den Zeitpunkt, zu dem die Änderung in Kraft tritt, sowie Ihr Recht informiert, das Abonnement innerhalb von 30 Tagen nach der Benachrichtigung gemäß diesem Abschnitt 3.6 zu kündigen.

**4\. Datennutzung**

4.2. Wir sind ständig bestrebt, Sie vor Belästigungen wie Hacker-Angriffen, Spam oder Romance-Scams zu schützen. Zu diesem Zweck haben wir zahlreiche technische und organisatorische Standards entwickelt. Es liegt in Ihrer Verantwortung, die Benutzerrichtlinien gemäß dem nachstehenden Abschnitt 8 einzuhalten. Bei Unregelmäßigkeiten werden Sie möglicherweise von unserem für Vertrauen und Sicherheit zuständigen Team kontaktiert, damit diese Unregelmäßigkeiten behoben werden können. In diesem Fall legen wir die Gründe für die Kontaktaufnahme mit Ihnen im Einzelnen dar und Sie sind verpflichtet, mit einer solchen Anfrage zu kooperieren und innerhalb einer angemessenen Frist darauf zu antworten. Etwaige Handlungsempfehlungen unsererseits sollten Sie gründlich prüfen. Sollten Sie eine empfohlene Maßnahme ablehnen, sind Sie dazu verpflichtet, uns innerhalb einer angemessenen Frist unter Angabe der Gründe für die Ablehnung unserer Handlungsempfehlung informieren. Ebenfalls sollten Sie problematische Inhalte oder Verhaltensweisen über die Meldefunktion an uns melden.

4.3. Es steht uns frei, unbeantwortete Nachrichten, die von oder an Profile gesendet wurden, die als Spam oder Romance-Scam identifiziert wurden oder anderweitig gelöscht wurden, automatisch zu löschen.

**5\. Kündigung/Verlängerung**

**Bitte beachten Sie Abschnitt 11, wenn Sie von Ihrem Widerrufsrecht Gebrauch machen und Ihre Premium-Mitgliedschaft innerhalb der 14-tägigen Widerrufsfrist kündigen möchten.**

5.1. Es steht Ihnen frei, Ihre Basis-Mitgliedschaft jederzeit mit sofortiger Wirkung über Ihre Kontoeinstellungen oder durch Kontaktaufnahme mit uns ([support@themeetgroup.com](mailto:support@themeetgroup.com)) zu kündigen.

5.2. Wenn Sie im Rahmen Ihrer Basis-Mitgliedschaft über aktive virtuelle Güter verfügen, müssen Sie uns per E-Mail an [support@themeetgroup.com](mailto:support@themeetgroup.com) über die Kündigung informieren. Bitte geben Sie dabei die mit Ihrem Konto verknüpfte E-Mail-Adresse oder ähnliche Anmeldedaten an, damit wir Sie identifizieren können.

5.3. Wenn Sie Ihre Premium-Mitgliedschaft zu einem beliebigen Zeitpunkt kündigen möchten, steht Ihnen das jederzeit frei. Wenn die Gebühren für Ihre Premium-Mitgliedschaft über unsere Website in Rechnung gestellt werden, müssen Sie spätestens drei Tage vor Fälligkeit Ihrer nächsten automatischen Zahlung unter [http://www.tagged.com/account\_info.html](http://www.tagged.com/account_info.html) die Registerkarte „Abonnements und Zahlungen anklicken, „Abonnement kündigen“ auswählen und „Premium kündigen“ anklicken, damit wir Ihre Kündigung ordnungsgemäß bearbeiten können. Wenn Sie diese Frist nicht einhalten, steht es Ihnen dennoch frei, Ihr Abonnement zum Ende der jeweiligen Laufzeit zu kündigen; jedoch ziehen wir dann unter Umständen die Gebühr für den folgenden Abrechnungszeitraum ein, die wir Ihnen dann rückerstatten. Ihr Recht auf Kündigung Ihrer Premium-Mitgliedschaft aus anderen Gründen bleibt hiervon unberührt. In diesem Fall müssen Sie die Gründe für die außerordentliche Kündigung angeben, wenn Sie Ihr Abonnement aus diesem Grund kündigen. Wenn die Abrechnung über Apple erfolgt, müssen Sie Ihre Premium-Mitgliedschaft spätestens 24 Stunden vor Fälligkeit Ihrer nächsten automatischen Zahlung kündigen, indem Sie die [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039) bereitgestellten Anweisungen befolgen. Wenn die Abrechnung über Google Play erfolgt, müssen Sie Ihre Premium-Mitgliedschaft innerhalb von sieben Tagen ab Beginn Ihres Abrechnungszyklus kündigen, indem Sie die [here](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid) bereitgestellten Anweisungen befolgen. Sie können uns auch über die nachstehend in Abschnitt 16 bereitgestellten Kontaktangaben postalisch benachrichtigen. Vorbehaltlich der nachstehenden Abschnitte 5.5 und 11 wird eine Kündigung Ihres Abonnements erst zum Ende des jeweiligen Abrechnungszeitraums wirksam (und Sie haben daher keinen Anspruch auf Rückerstattung). Um zu verhindern, dass sich Ihre Premium-Mitgliedschaft automatisch verlängert, müssen Sie uns vor Ende der jeweiligen Laufzeit Ihres Abonnements mitteilen, dass Sie Ihr Abonnement kündigen wollen.

5.4. Wenn Sie Ihr Basis- oder Premium-Mitgliedskonto löschen, werden zuvor erworbene virtuelle Güter ebenfalls gelöscht, während bestehende Zahlungsverpflichtungen aus dem Kauf kostenpflichtiger Dienste oder Funktionen (wie virtuelle Güter) bestehen bleiben, vorbehaltlich der geltenden Kündigungsrechte (siehe Abschnitt 12).

5.5. Zur Authentifizierung Ihrer Identität und Ihres Kündigungsantrags müssen Sie dabei die mit Ihrem Konto verknüpfte E-Mail-Adresse oder andere Angaben zu Ihrer Person bereitstellen, damit wir Sie identifizieren können.

5.6. Wenn Sie sich für den Erwerb einer Premium-Mitgliedschaft entscheiden, verlängert sich Ihre Mitgliedschaft automatisch auf monatlicher Basis, sofern Sie sie nicht gemäß den Bestimmungen dieses Abschnitts kündigen.

5.7. Wenn Sie Ihre Premium-Mitgliedschaft kündigen, wird Ihr Konto auf eine Basis-Mitgliedschaft zurückgesetzt. Wenn Sie Ihre Basis-Mitgliedschaft kündigen möchten, befolgen Sie bitte das in Abschnitt 5.1 beschriebene Verfahren.

5.8. Vorbehaltlich Abschnitt 5.4 und in Übereinstimmung mit Abschnitt 3.6 gelten folgende Bestimmungen, wenn Sie Ihre Premium-Mitgliedschaft kündigen wollen, weil wir Sie über eine bevorstehende wesentliche Änderung an unserem Service benachrichtigt haben: Ihr Abonnement endet sofort, nachdem wir Ihre Kündigung in Schriftform erhalten haben (z. B. per E-Mail oder Fax), und wir erstatten Ihnen die anteiligen Gebühren für nicht erbrachte Leistungen im Rahmen Ihrer Premium-Mitgliedschaft.

**6\. Funktionalität, Kompatibilität, Interoperabilität, Garantien und Haftung**

6.1. Bitte beachten Sie, dass wir uns zwar im Rahmen des Möglichen bemühen, die jederzeitige Verfügbarkeit des Service jedoch nicht garantieren können. Die Verfügbarkeit des Service kann aufgrund anfallender Wartungsarbeiten und Software-Updates eingeschränkt werden sowie aufgrund technischer oder anderer Probleme, die sich unserer Kontrolle entziehen.

6.2. Einige Funktionen sind ausschließlich über die Website bzw. über die App verfügbar. Über die Mobile App ist z. B. kein Zugriff auf Funktionen wie Tags, Herzen und die benutzerspezifische Anpassung von Web-Profilen möglich. Die Live-Funktion kann nur über die Mobile App aufgerufen und genutzt werden.

6.3. Wir stellen unsere Dienste kostenlos über die Websites für Mobilgeräte bereit, jedoch gelten weiterhin die Standardgebühren und -tarife Ihres Mobilfunkanbieters. Die Verantwortung für alle Kosten liegt bei Ihnen.

6.4. Um den Service in vollem Umfang nutzen zu können, sollten Sie auf Ihrem Mobilgerät oder Computer (Browser-)Technologien auf dem aktuellen Stand nutzen (z. B. Java-Script, Cookies, Pop-ups aktivieren). Die Nutzung älterer Betriebssysteme oder Internetdienstanbieter führt möglicherweise dazu, dass Sie den Service nur in begrenztem Umfang nutzen können. Bei Nutzung der App können bedingt durch Ihr Mobilgerät, Betriebssystem oder die ausgewählten Einstellungen bestimmte App-Funktionen möglicherweise nur eingeschränkt genutzt werden (z. B. Push-Benachrichtigungen, Filtern von Suchergebnissen nach Entfernung).

6.5. Wenn wir Produktaktualisierungen bereitstellen, insbesondere Updates für unsere Android- und iOS-Apps, empfehlen wir Ihnen dringend, diese möglichst zeitnah zu installieren. Es liegt in Ihrer Verantwortung, derartige Updates innerhalb eines angemessenen Zeitraums zu installieren. Wenn Sie dies nicht tun, obwohl wir Sie darüber informiert haben, dass ein Update verfügbar ist und dass bestimmte Konsequenzen eintreten können, wenn es nicht installiert wird, haften wir nicht für etwaige Produktmängel, die darauf zurückzuführen sind, dass Sie das Update nicht installiert haben; das gilt nicht für Fälle, in denen die Nichtinstallierung bzw. inkorrekte Installierung des Updates dadurch verursacht wurde, dass wir Ihnen unzureichende Anweisungen zur Installierung des Updates bereitgestellt haben.

6.6. Sie sind für die Richtigkeit der Informationen verantwortlich, die Sie bei Ihrer Registrierung bereitstellen. Wenn Sie die in Ihrem Profil oder bei Ihrer Registrierung angegebenen Informationen aktualisieren müssen, können Sie das grundsätzlich jederzeit über Ihr Profil tun. Bestimmte Informationen können jedoch nur aktualisiert werden, indem Sie uns über die Angaben in Abschnitt 16 kontaktieren. Wenn Sie uns kontaktieren müssen, um bestimmte Informationen zu aktualisieren, weisen wir Sie zudem ausdrücklich darauf hin.

6.7. Wir sind lediglich für die technische Bereitstellung des Dienstes verantwortlich (wie in Abschnitt 3 näher beschrieben). Wir werden Ihnen grundsätzlich ermöglichen, Kontakte zu anderen Mitgliedern zu knüpfen. Wir können jedoch nicht garantieren, dass Sie durch die Nutzung des Dienstes einen Partner finden.

6.8. Wir erwarten zwar von unseren Mitgliedern, dass sie den Service auf zuvorkommende und respektvolle Weise (und in Übereinstimmung mit diesen Nutzungsbedingungen) nutzen, wir sind jedoch nicht verantwortlich für jeglichen Missbrauch der über den Service bereitgestellten personenbezogenen Daten; die Nutzung des Service unter Verstoß gegen diese Nutzungsbedingungen; oder jegliche sonstige unbefugte oder rechtswidrige Nutzung. Ebenso sind wir nicht verantwortlich für jeglichen Missbrauch von Daten oder Informationen durch Mitglieder, Nichtmitglieder oder Dritte, denen Sie diese Informationen bereitgestellt haben. Wenn wir jedoch Kenntnis von einem solchen Missbrauch oder einer Rechtswidrigkeit der Inhalte (wie in Abschnitt 9.2 definiert) über unsere Dienste erhalten, ergreifen wir die erforderlichen Vorkehrungen zur Verhinderung künftigen Missbrauchs und sonstiger Verstöße gegen diese Nutzungsbedingungen und die geltenden Gesetze.

6.9. Wir sind sehr bestrebt, einen qualitativ hochwertigen Service bereitzustellen, können jedoch nicht garantieren, dass der Service jederzeit einwandfrei funktioniert, und können nicht gewährleisten, dass der Service immer unterbrechungsfrei, sicher oder fehlerfrei ist. Insbesondere haften wir nicht für Störungen, die die Verfügbarkeit des Service beeinträchtigen, wenn derartige Störungen durch Handlungen oder Ereignisse verursacht werden, die sich unserer Kontrolle entziehen. Außerdem richten wir zwar angemessene technische und organisatorische Sicherheitsvorkehrungen ein, um Ihre personenbezogenen Daten zu schützen, übernehmend jedoch, soweit gesetzlich zulässig, keine Haftung für etwaige unbefugte Zugriffe auf Ihre personenbezogenen Daten (z. B. durch Hacker, die sich unbefugten Zugriff auf unsere Datenbank verschaffen), sofern dies nicht auf ein schuldhaftes Handeln oder Unterlassen unsererseits zurückzuführen ist, insbesondere durch das Versäumnis, alle erforderlichen Vorkehrungen zur Verhinderung von Verstößen gegen die geltenden Gesetze zu treffen.

6.10. Unabhängig von der jeweils geltend gemachten Rechtsgrundlage haften wir im gesetzlich vorgeschriebenen Umfang nur unter folgenden Bedingungen für Schäden, die aus der Nutzung der Dienste entstehen:

a) Wir haften in unbeschränktem Umfang für Schäden, die durch Tod oder Körperverletzung entstehen, sowie für Schäden, die durch vorsätzliches Handeln oder grobe Fahrlässigkeit unsererseits, durch unsere gesetzlichen Vertreter oder Erfüllungsgehilfen oder durch Nichteinhaltung einer von uns übernommenen Garantie oder durch arglistig verschwiegene Mängel entstanden sind.

b) Für alle sonstigen Schäden, die durch Verletzung wesentlicher Vertragspflichten aus einfacher Fahrlässigkeit unsererseits oder seitens unserer gesetzlichen Vertreter oder Erfüllungsgehilfen verursacht werden, beruht unsere Haftung auf den konkreten Sachverhalten. Wesentliche Vertragspflichten (Kardinalpflichten) sind solche, deren Erfüllung die ordnungsgemäße Vertragsdurchführung überhaupt ermöglicht und auf deren Erfüllung sich der Vertragspartner im Normalfall verlassen kann. In solchen Fällen haften wir in Höhe des typischen Schadensersatzes für vorhersehbare Schäden aus einem derartigen Vertrag. In allen anderen Fällen wird die Haftung ausgeschlossen.

c) Die Haftung nach dem deutschen Produkthaftungsgesetz (ProdHaftG) bleibt von den vorstehenden Bestimmungen unberührt.

6.11. Sie sind verpflichtet, geeignete Maßnahmen zu ergreifen, um Schäden zu verhindern und zu begrenzen, insbesondere, soweit technisch möglich, ein angemessenes Sicherheitsniveau für Ihre Daten auf Ihren Geräten zu gewährleisten. Die Haftung für Datenbeschädigung oder -verluste beschränkt sich auf den typischen Wiederherstellungsaufwand, der erforderlich gewesen wäre, wenn Sicherungskopien regelmäßig und entsprechend der Gefährdungsstufe erstellt worden wären und wenn ausreichender Virenschutz eingesetzt worden wäre.

**7\. Verantwortung und Pflichten des Kunden**

7.1. Wenn Sie eine Premium-Mitgliedschaft und/oder andere kostenpflichtige Dienste oder Funktionen erwerben, erklären Sie sich damit einverstanden, alle in den Abonnementbedingungen (und ggf. zusätzlichen Bedingungen, z.

Ebenfalls nehmen Sie zur Kenntnis, dass die Verwendung von Computerprogrammen zum Zweck des automatischen Auslesens von Dateien mit Mitgliedsdaten (z. B. Crawlern) untersagt ist.

Sie nehmen zur Kenntnis, dass es uns freisteht, alle in Ihrem Konto gespeicherten Nachrichten nach Ablauf eines Zeitraums von zwölf Monaten nach dem Datum zu löschen, an dem die Nachricht empfangen wurde, ohne Sie darüber zu benachrichtigen. Wenn Sie eine Basis-Mitgliedschaft nutzen, nehmen Sie zur Kenntnis, dass alle Daten im Zusammenhang mit Ihrer aktuellen Basis-Mitgliedschaft automatisch gelöscht werden, wenn Ihr Profil 24 Monate lang inaktiv ist.

7.7. Jeder Benutzer ist verpflichtet, die [Content and Conduct Policy](https://terms.tagged.com/content-and-conduct) zu beachten. Darüber hinaus ist es Ihnen nicht gestattet:

– zu versuchen, sich unbefugten Zugriff auf unsere Datenbank oder sonstige Computersysteme zu verschaffen;

B. während wir Ihre Aktivitäten untersuchen); oder (wenn für uns eindeutig feststeht, dass ein schwerwiegender Missbrauch des Service vorliegt) wir können die Bereitstellung des Service für Sie beenden. Wenn Sie Ihre Premium-Mitgliedschaft über Apple/Google erworben haben, erfolgen etwaige Rückerstattungen gemäß den Bedingungen von Apple/Google, wie im Abschnitt 2.4 näher erläutert.

Sie versichern und garantieren, dass Sie Eigentümer Ihrer Inhalte sind oder die notwendigen Lizenzen, Berechtigungen, Einwilligungen und Genehmigungen zu ihrer Veröffentlichung eingeholt haben. Wir haben Mechanismen zur regelmäßigen Überwachung Ihrer Inhalte hinsichtlich der Einhaltung dieser Nutzungsbedingungen und der geltenden gesetzlichen Vorschriften eingerichtet, insbesondere zur Verhinderung eines Missbrauchs Ihrer Daten, haben jedoch keine vollständige Kontrolle über die veröffentlichten Inhalte und haben daher keine Kontrolle über ihre Richtigkeit, Integrität, Qualität oder jedwede andere Aspekte.

9.3. Hiermit gewähren Sie dem Unternehmen das Recht zur Nutzung, Verbreitung, Vervielfältigung, Aufzeichnung, Änderung, Anpassung, Verarbeitung, Kombination, Synchronisation, Erstellung abgeleiteter Werke, Veröffentlichung, öffentlichen Aufführung und öffentlichen Anzeige solcher Inhalte (einschließlich Ihres Benutzernamens und Ihres Abbilds) in den Diensten ausschließlich zum Zweck der Bereitstellung unserer Dienste für Sie gemäß diesen Geschäftsbedingungen.

Sie übernehmen die mit der Nutzung von Inhalten verbundene Haftung, insbesondere in Bezug auf Ihre Gewährleistung der Richtigkeit, Vollständigkeit oder Nützlichkeit dieser Inhalte.

Diese Nutzungsbedingungen unterliegen den Gesetzen des US-Bundesstaats Kalifornien und werden gemäß diesen ausgelegt, ohne dass etwaige anderslautende kollisionsrechtliche Grundsätze Berücksichtigung finden.

Les Services sont uniquement accessibles depuis des applications mobiles installées sur des appareils iOS et Android (bien qu'à l'avenir, d'autres systèmes d'exploitation pourraient être mis à disposition), ou depuis notre site web Tagged et/ou Hi5 (veuillez noter que certaines fonctionnalités ne sont disponibles que depuis l'application mobile ou le web) ; et les Services comprennent certains services qui sont gratuits et d'autres qui sont payants.

Nous offrons nos Services à l'échelle mondiale ; nos membres ont la possibilité de rechercher et de contacter d'autres membres dans n'importe lequel des pays dans lesquels nous opérons.

**2\. Accès aux Services et conclusion de votre abonnement**

2.1. Pour accéder aux Services et les utiliser, une inscription est nécessaire. Pour ce faire, vous devrez choisir l'une des options d'inscription disponibles, telle que l'e-mail, le SMS, la connexion avec Apple, Google ou Facebook, et fournir des identifiants de connexion, tels qu'une adresse e-mail et un mot de passe de votre choix. Vous êtes responsable de la confidentialité de votre mot de passe et des identifiants de votre compte. Vous êtes également responsable de toutes les activités répréhensibles qui sont menées à l'aide de votre compte. Vous acceptez de nous informer immédiatement de toute utilisation non autorisée de votre compte ou de toute autre violation de sécurité dès que vous en avez connaissance.

2.2. Une fois votre inscription finalisée avec succès, vous pourrez accéder à nos Services gratuits (« Abonnement Basic »).

2.3. Nous proposons également différents services ou fonctionnalités qui sont payants. Avant de vous inscrire en vue d'acheter de tels services ou fonctionnalités, nous vous fournirons de plus amples informations sur ce que vous allez acheter, par exemple, le cas échéant : les caractéristiques principales des services ou des fonctionnalités, la durée de votre abonnement (y compris toute prolongation), comment résilier votre abonnement, son prix et les éventuelles conditions de paiement et limitations au niveau des moyens de paiement. Dans le cas où vous achetez des Biens virtuels (voir la clause 3.3 ci-dessous), nous vous informerons également que ceux-ci sont uniquement échangeables sur les Services contre des marchandises et contenus numériques et qu'ils ne sont pas remboursables. Si vous voulez améliorer votre Abonnement Basic en choisissant un abonnement payant (« Abonnement Premium »), ou accéder à d'autres services ou fonctionnalités payants, vous reconnaissez qu'en appuyant sur le bouton « Acheter maintenant » (ou tout bouton similaire), vous aurez confirmé vouloir acheter l'Abonnement Premium ou les autres services ou fonctionnalités sélectionnés. Notre relation contractuelle pour ces achats sera confirmée à la date à laquelle vous recevrez une confirmation de votre commande. Veuillez cependant noter que l'exécution de votre obligation de paiement envers nous est soumise à la vérification et au traitement de l'achat par le prestataire de services de paiement concerné.

2.4. Vous pouvez également effectuer des achats depuis notre application Apple iOS ou notre application Google Android. Cela comprend l'achat d'un Abonnement Premium ou de tout autre service ou fonctionnalité payants. Dans ce cas, nous restons responsables de la fourniture de nos Services. Vous recevrez une confirmation de commande concernant vos Conditions d'abonnement après avoir effectué un tel achat. Cependant, tout achat et/ou abonnement est conclu (et doit être annulé ou résilié) uniquement par l'intermédiaire d'Apple ou de Google (voir clause 5.3), et est soumis aux normes et principes techniques établis par Apple ou Google, sur lesquels nous n'avons aucun contrôle. En règle générale, l'achat depuis une boutique d'applications se déclenche lorsque vous cliquez sur « Acheter maintenant » (ou tout bouton similaire) et que, le cas échéant, vous saisissez votre mot de passe ou des identifiants équivalents (par exemple, Touch ID ou Face ID) pour l'App Store. Votre relation contractuelle avec Apple ou Google sera confirmée à la date à laquelle Apple ou Google vous enverra un e-mail de confirmation de votre commande. Apple ou Google vous facturera alors les frais correspondant à tout Abonnement Premium par l'intermédiaire de votre compte Apple ou Google. Vous trouverez également dans la boutique d'applications les informations essentielles dont vous avez besoin concernant votre relation contractuelle avec Apple ou Google. Si vous achetez un Abonnement Premium avec renouvellement automatique depuis une boutique d'applications, cet Abonnement Premium sera valable pour une durée déterminée, qui sera automatiquement prolongée à moins que vous ne résiliiez votre abonnement auprès d'Apple ou de Google, conformément aux Conditions générales d'utilisation d'Apple ou de Google.

Toute notification de ce type vous informera de la nature et des motifs de la modification effectuée, de la date à laquelle elle prendra effet, et de votre droit de résilier l'abonnement dans les 30 jours suivant la notification, conformément à la présente clause 3.6.

Si nous vous recommandons certaines actions, nous vous conseillons vivement de les prendre en considération.

Les obligations contractuelles essentielles (obligations cardinales) sont celles dont l'exécution permet en premier lieu la bonne exécution du contrat et sur l'exécution desquelles le partenaire contractuel peut normalement compter.

Wzór formularza odstąpienia od umowy

**1\. Opis usługi**

1.1. Po zarejestrowaniu konta zapewnimy użytkownikowi dostęp do platformy internetowej, za pośrednictwem której użytkownik będzie mógł poznać innych zarejestrowanych klientów (zwanych również członkami). Dostęp do Usługi można uzyskać wyłącznie za pośrednictwem aplikacji mobilnych na urządzeniach z systemem iOS i Android (chociaż w przyszłości dostęp może być możliwy za pośrednictwem innych systemów operacyjnych) lub za pośrednictwem naszej witryny internetowej Tagged i/lub Hi5 (należy pamiętać, że niektóre funkcje są dostępne tylko za pośrednictwem aplikacji mobilnej lub witryny internetowej), a Usługa obejmuje zarówno usługi, które są bezpłatne, oraz takie, które są płatne.

1.2. Usługa zawiera „profile” członków, które zawierają treści (zwane również „danymi”) udostępniane przez tych członków. Użytkownik może również znaleźć więcej informacji na temat rodzajów danych osobowych, które są gromadzone, oraz sposobu, w jaki sposób te informacje są udostępniane innym członkom, w naszej [Polityce prywatności](https://secure.tagged.com/terms_of_service.html?#privacy_policy) (patrz punkt 5 poniżej). Oferujemy naszą Usługę na całym świecie; a nasi członkowie mogą wyszukiwać innych członków i kontaktować się z nimi w dowolnym z krajów, w których działamy.

**2\. Dostęp do usługi i zakończenie subskrypcji**

2.1. Aby uzyskać dostęp do Usługi i korzystać z niej, użytkownik musi się zarejestrować. Aby to zrobić, użytkownik musi wybrać jedną z dostępnych opcji rejestracji, taką jak wiadomość e-mail, SMS, opcja logowania za pomocą aplikacji Apple, przez Google lub Facebook, a następnie podać dane logowania, takie jak adres e-mail i wybrane przez siebie hasło. Za zachowanie poufności swojego hasła i danych logowania do konta odpowiada użytkownik. Ponadto użytkownik ponosi odpowiedzialność za wszelkie zawinione działania, które będą miały miejsce z wykorzystaniem konta użytkownika. Użytkownik zgadza się natychmiast powiadomić nas o każdym nieautoryzowanym użyciu jego konta lub jakimkolwiek innym naruszeniu bezpieczeństwa, gdy tylko się o nim dowie.

2.2. Po pomyślnej rejestracji użytkownik uzyska dostęp do naszej bezpłatnej usługi („Członkostwo podstawowe”).

2.3. Oferujemy również różne usługi lub funkcje, które podlegają opłacie. Zanim użytkownik zarejestruje się w celu zakupu takich usług lub funkcji, przekażemy mu dalsze informacje na temat przedmiotu zakupu – na przykład, w stosownych przypadkach: główne cechy usług lub funkcji, okres subskrypcji (w tym wszelkie przedłużenia), sposób zakończenia subskrypcji, cena i wszelkie płatności warunki i ograniczenia dotyczące środków płatności. W przypadku zakupu Towarów wirtualnych (patrz punkt 3.3 poniżej) poinformujemy użytkownika, że można je wymienić wyłącznie w Usłudze na cyfrowe towary i treści oraz że nie podlegają one zwrotowi. Jeśli użytkownik chce rozszerzyć swoje Członkostwo podstawowe, wybierając członkostwo podlegające opłacie („Członkostwo Premium”), bądź chce uzyskać dostęp do innych usług lub funkcji podlegających opłacie, tym samym potwierdza poprzez naciśnięcie przycisku „Kup teraz” (lub podobnego przycisku), że wyraża wolę zakupu Członkostwa Premium albo innej wybranej usługi lub funkcji. Nasz stosunek umowny dotyczący takich zakupów zostanie potwierdzony w dniu, w którym użytkownik otrzyma potwierdzenie złożenia zamówienia. Należy jednak pamiętać, że wypełnienie zobowiązania płatniczego użytkownika wobec nas zależy od weryfikacji i przetworzenia zakupu przez odpowiedniego dostawcę usług płatniczych.

2.4. Użytkownik może również dokonywać zakupów za pośrednictwem naszej aplikacji Apple iOS lub aplikacji Google Android. Obejmuje to zakup Członkostwa Premium albo innych usług lub funkcji podlegających opłacie. W takim przypadku pozostajemy odpowiedzialni za świadczenie naszej Usługi. Po dokonaniu takiego zakupu użytkownik otrzyma potwierdzenie złożenia zamówienia wraz z Warunkami subskrypcji. Każdy zakup i/lub subskrypcja są jednak zawierane (i muszą być anulowane lub zakończone) wyłącznie za pośrednictwem firmy Apple/Google (patrz punkt 5.3) i podlegają standardom technicznym i zasadom ustanowionym przez firmy Apple/Google, nad którymi nie mamy kontroli. Zasadniczo zakup za pośrednictwem sklepu z aplikacjami następuje po kliknięciu przycisku „Kup teraz” (lub porównywalnego przycisku) i, w razie potrzeby, wprowadzeniu hasła lub równoważnych danych uwierzytelniających (np. Touch ID lub Face ID) do sklepu z aplikacjami. Stosunek umowny użytkownika z firmą Apple/Google zostanie potwierdzony w dniu, w którym firma Apple/Google wyśle użytkownikowi wiadomość e-mail z potwierdzeniem złożonego zamówienia, oraz gdy firma Apple/Google wystawi użytkownikowi fakturę za wszelkie opłaty związane z Członkostwem Premium za pośrednictwem konta Apple/Google należącego do użytkownika. W sklepie z aplikacjami użytkownik znajdzie również wszystkie niezbędne informacje na temat relacji umownych z firmą Apple/Google. Jeśli użytkownik zakupi Członkostwo Premium za pośrednictwem sklepu z aplikacjami, które podlega automatycznemu przedłużeniu, Członkostwo Premium będzie obowiązywać przez określony czas, który zostanie automatycznie przedłużony, chyba że użytkownik zakończy subskrypcję za pośrednictwem firmy Apple/Google zgodnie z Warunkami korzystania z usługi firmy Apple/Google. Należy pamiętać, że punkty 5.3 i 12 niniejszych Warunków korzystania z usługi nie będą miały zastosowania w przypadku zakupu Członkostwa Premium za pośrednictwem firmy Apple/Google.

2.5. Prosimy o zapoznanie się z punktami 14 i 15 poniżej, gdzie przedstawiamy warunki, które będą miały zastosowanie, jeśli użytkownik pobrał naszą aplikację z Apple lub Google. Prosimy również o zwrócenie uwagi, że jeśli nasza aplikacja została pobrana ze sklepu Apple/Google, obowiązują warunki korzystania z usługi sklepu Apple/Google, które będą miały pierwszeństwo przed niniejszymi Warunkami korzystania z usługi, jeśli wystąpi jakikolwiek konflikt.

**3\. Bezpłatne i odpłatne usługi i zakupy**

3.1. Rejestracja w Usłudze i korzystanie z Członkostwa podstawowego jest bezpłatne.

3.2. Użytkownik może zdecydować o uaktualnieniu członkostwa do statusu Premium („Członkostwo Premium”) za dodatkową opłatą miesięczną. Jeśli użytkownik zdecyduje się na zakup Członkostwa Premium, będzie ono automatycznie odnawiane co miesiąc.

3.3. Użytkownik może kupować „Towary wirtualne” do użytku wyłącznie w Usłudze (takie jak wirtualne „złoto”). Zakupy lub inne nabycia Towarów wirtualnych zapewniają jedynie ograniczoną, niezbywalną, niepodlegającą sublicencjonowaniu, w pełni odwołalną licencję na korzystanie z takich Towarów wirtualnych w celu uzyskania dostępu do usług, które wyraźnie udostępniamy z takimi Towarami wirtualnymi do osobistego, niekomercyjnego użytku (takiego jak animacje na żywo, tak zwane wirtualne „Prezenty”). Towary wirtualne można wymieniać wyłącznie w Usłudze na cyfrowe towary i treści. Towary wirtualne nie tracą ważności. Towary wirtualne nie podlegają zwrotowi. Towary wirtualne nie mają wartości pieniężnej i nie stanowią waluty ani własności jakiegokolwiek rodzaju. Towary wirtualne nie podlegają przeniesieniu ani cesji.

Ponadto, mimo że udostępniamy opis naszej Usługi w naszej witrynie internetowej, możemy od czasu do czasu zmieniać główne cechy naszej Usługi bez ponoszenia przez użytkownika żadnych dodatkowych kosztów. W przypadku gdy to zrobimy, powiadomimy użytkownika o tym w rozsądnym terminie przed wejściem w życie takiej zmiany, a użytkownik może skontaktować się z nami, aby zakończyć subskrypcję w ciągu 30 dni od otrzymania informacji o takiej zmianie, jeśli zmiana ogranicza zdolność dostępu do Usług przez użytkownika lub ogranicza użyteczność Usług i jeśli takie ograniczenie jest nie tylko nieistotne przed wejściem zmian w życie (oraz, w przypadku subskrypcji w odniesieniu do Członkostwa Premium nabytego za naszym pośrednictwem, użytkownik otrzyma od nas zwrot pieniędzy część usługi, za którą zapłacił, ale której nie otrzymał z powodu wcześniejszego zakończenia subskrypcji). Każde takie zawiadomienie poinformuje użytkownika o charakterze i powodach wprowadzenia takiej zmiany, czasie, w którym zmiana wejdzie w życie, oraz prawie użytkownika do zakończenia subskrypcji w ciągu 30 dni od takiego powiadomienia zgodnie z niniejszym punktem 3.6.

**4\. Wykorzystanie danych**

4.1. Więcej informacji na temat tego, jak wykorzystujemy lub w inny sposób przetwarzamy dane osobowe użytkownika oraz jakie są nasze obowiązki w zakresie ochrony danych, można znaleźć w naszej [Polityce prywatności](https://secure.tagged.com/terms_of_service.html?#privacy_policy).

4.2. Nieustannie staramy się chronić użytkowników przed nękaniem, takim jak ataki hakerów, spam lub oszustwa romansowe. W tym celu opracowaliśmy liczne standardy techniczne i organizacyjne. Obowiązkiem użytkownika jest przestrzeganie wskazówek zawartych w punkcie 8 poniżej. W przypadku pojawienia się nieprawidłowości nasz zespół ds. zaufania i bezpieczeństwa może kontaktować się z użytkownikiem w celu usunięcia takich nieprawidłowości. W takim przypadku szczegółowo określimy powody skontaktowania się z użytkownikiem, a użytkownik jest zobowiązany do współpracy i udzielenia odpowiedzi w rozsądnym terminie od otrzymania takiego wniosku. Jeśli zalecimy jakieś działania, użytkownik powinien poważnie rozważyć ich podjęcie. Jeśli użytkownik odrzuci zalecane działania, jest zobowiązany do poinformowania nas o tym w rozsądnym terminie wraz z podaniem powodów, dla których odmawia podjęcie sugerowanych przez nas działań. Użytkownik jest też zobowiązany do zgłaszania nam problematycznych treści lub zachowań za pośrednictwem funkcji dokonywania zgłoszeń.

4.3. Możemy automatycznie usuwać wiadomości bez odpowiedzi wysłane przez profile lub do profili, które zostały zidentyfikowane jako spam lub oszustwo romansowe bądź zostały usunięte z innych przyczyn.

**5\. Zakończenie/przedłużenie**

**W przypadku gdy użytkownik chce anulować Członkostwo Premium w ciągu 14-dniowego okresu anulowania / możliwości odstąpienia od umowy, prosimy o zapoznanie się z punktem 11 (prawo użytkownika do anulowania).**

5.1. Użytkownik może zakończyć Członkostwo podstawowe w dowolnym momencie ze skutkiem natychmiastowym w ustawieniach konta lub poprzez skontaktowanie się z nami pod adresem [(support@themeetgroup.com)](mailto:support@themeetgroup.com).

5.2. Jeśli Członkostwo podstawowe użytkownika obejmuje aktywne Towary wirtualne, użytkownik musi poinformować nas o zakończeniu na adres [support@themeetgroup.com](mailto:support@themeetgroup.com). Należy pamiętać o podaniu adresu e-mail powiązanego z kontem użytkownika lub porównywalnych danych logowania, które umożliwią nam identyfikację użytkownika.

5.3. Jeśli w dowolnym czasie użytkownik postanowi zrezygnować z Członkostwa Premium, może to zrobić w dogodnym dla siebie momencie. Jeśli konto Członkostwa Premium użytkownika jest opłacane za pośrednictwem naszej witryny internetowej, użytkownik musi ją odwiedzić pod adresem [http://www.tagged.com/account\_info.html](http://www.tagged.com/account_info.html), kliknąć kartę Subskrypcje i płatności, wybrać pozycję „Anuluj subskrypcję” i kliknąć „Anuluj Premium” na co najmniej trzy dni przed kolejną zaplanowaną automatyczną płatnością, abyśmy mogli poprawnie przetworzyć rezygnację użytkownika. Jeśli nie uda się tego zrobić w tym terminie, użytkownik nadal może anulować subskrypcję przed końcem danego okresu subskrypcji, jednak pieniądze za kolejny okres mogą zostać pobrane, ale dokonamy ich zwrotu. Prawo do zakończenia Członkostwa Premium na innej podstawie pozostaje niezmienione. W takim przypadku użytkownik musi podać powody rozwiązania umowy w trybie nadzwyczajnym, gdy subskrypcja ma zostać anulowana na tej podstawie. Jeśli konto Członkostwa Premium użytkownika jest rozliczane za pośrednictwem Apple, użytkownik musi je anulować na co najmniej 24 godziny przed następną zaplanowaną automatyczną płatnością, postępując zgodnie z procesem opisanym [tutaj](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039). Jeśli konto Członkostwa Premium użytkownika jest rozliczane za pośrednictwem Google Play, użytkownik musi je anulować w ciągu siedmiu dni od rozpoczęcia cyklu rozliczeniowego, postępując zgodnie z procesem opisanym [tutaj](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid). Użytkownik może również napisać do nas, korzystając z danych kontaktowych podanych poniżej w punkcie 16. Z zastrzeżeniem punktu 5.5 i punktu 11 poniżej żadne wypowiedzenie subskrypcji nie wejdzie w życie przed końcem bieżącego okresu rozliczeniowego (i w związku z tym użytkownik nie będzie uprawniony do zwrotu pieniędzy). W związku z tym, aby mieć pewność, że Członkostwo Premium użytkownika nie zostanie automatycznie przedłużone, użytkownik musi poinformować nas, że chce zakończyć subskrypcję przed końcem bieżącego okresu subskrypcji.

5.4. Jeśli użytkownik usunie swoje Członkostwo podstawowe lub Premium, wszelkie wcześniej zakupione Towary wirtualne również zostaną usunięte, a istniejące zobowiązania płatnicze z tytułu zakupu płatnych usług lub funkcji (takich jak Towary wirtualne) pozostaną w mocy, z zastrzeżeniem obowiązujących praw do anulowania (patrz punkt 12).

5.5. Aby zweryfikować swoją tożsamość i żądanie rozwiązania umowy, użytkownik musi podać adres e-mail powiązany z jego kontem lub inne dane osobowe, które umożliwią nam identyfikację użytkownika.

5.6. Jeśli użytkownik zdecyduje się na zakup Członkostwa Premium, będzie ono automatycznie odnawiane co miesiąc, o ile użytkownik nie anuluje subskrypcji zgodnie z warunkami w niniejszym punkcie.

5.7. Jeśli użytkownik zrezygnuje z Członkostwa Premium, status jego konta zostanie przywrócony do Członkostwa podstawowego. Aby zakończyć Członkostwo podstawowe, należy postępować zgodnie z procedurą określoną w punkcie 5.1.

5.8. Z zastrzeżeniem punktu 5.4 i zgodnie z punktem 3.6, jeśli użytkownik chce zakończyć swoje Członkostwo Premium, ponieważ poinformowaliśmy go o nadchodzącej istotnej zmianie w naszej Usłudze, subskrypcja zakończy się natychmiast po otrzymaniu przez nas wypowiedzenia w formie pisemnej (na przykład wysłanego w wiadomości e-mail lub faksem), a my zwrócimy użytkownikowi pieniądze za każdą część Członkostwa Premium, której nie zrealizowaliśmy. Jeśli użytkownik zakupił Członkostwo Premium za pośrednictwem firmy Apple/Google, wszelkie anulowanie i zwrot pieniędzy zostaną dokonane zgodnie z warunkami firmy Apple/Google, jak opisano w punktach 2.4 i 5.3.

**6\. Funkcjonalność, kompatybilność, interoperacyjność, gwarancje i odpowiedzialność**

6.1. Należy pamiętać, że choć dokładamy wszelkich starań, nie możemy zagwarantować, że Usługa będzie dostępna przez 100% czasu. Dostępność naszej Usługi może być ograniczona z powodu konserwacji i aktualizacji oprogramowania, a także w trakcie wszelkich okresów, w których Usługa jest niedostępna z powodu problemów technicznych lub innych będących poza naszą kontrolą.

6.2. Niektóre funkcje są dostępne tylko za pośrednictwem witryny internetowej lub aplikacji. Za pośrednictwem aplikacji mobilnej nie jest możliwe między innymi uzyskanie dostępu do niektórych funkcji, takich jak Tagged, Luv i dostosowywanie profilu internetowego, ani korzystanie z nich. Funkcja Live jest dostępna i używana wyłącznie za pośrednictwem aplikacji mobilnej.

6.3. Chociaż nasze Usługi za pośrednictwem witryn mobilnych świadczymy bezpłatnie, nadal będą obowiązywać standardowe opłaty i stawki operatora komórkowego użytkownika. Użytkownik ponosi odpowiedzialność za wszystkie opłaty.

6.4. Aby pełni korzystać z Usługi, użytkownik powinien korzystać z aktualnych technologii (przeglądarek) na swoim urządzeniu mobilnym lub komputerze (np. poprzez włączenie skryptu Java, plików cookie, wyskakujących okienek). Jeśli użytkownik korzysta ze starszego systemu operacyjnego lub dostawcy usług internetowych, możliwości korzystania z Usługi mogą być ograniczone. Podczas korzystania z aplikacji urządzenie mobilne użytkownika, jego system operacyjny lub wybrane ustawienia mogą ograniczać niektóre funkcje aplikacji (np. wiadomości push, wyszukiwanie odległości).

6.5. Jeśli oferujemy aktualizacje produktów, w tym aktualizacje naszych aplikacji na systemy Android i iOS, zdecydowanie zalecamy zainstalowanie ich najszybciej, jak to możliwe. Zainstalowanie takich aktualizacji w rozsądnym czasie jest obowiązkiem użytkownika. Jeśli użytkownik tego nie zrobi, pomimo że poinformowaliśmy go o dostępności aktualizacji i konsekwencjach jej niezainstalowania, nie będziemy ponosić odpowiedzialności za jakiekolwiek wady produktu wynikające z niezainstalowania aktualizacji; nie ma to zastosowania, jeśli fakt, że użytkownik nie zainstalował aktualizacji lub zainstalował ją w niewłaściwy sposób, jest spowodowany nieodpowiednimi instrukcjami instalacji dostarczonymi przez nas.

6.6. Użytkownik ponosi odpowiedzialność za dokładność informacji podanych podczas rejestracji. Jeśli użytkownik chce zaktualizować swój profil lub informacje podane przy rejestracji, może to zrobić w swoim profilu w dowolnym momencie. Istnieją jednak pewne informacje, które można zaktualizować wyłącznie poprzez skontaktowanie się nami za pomocą danych kontaktowych podanych w punkcie 16. Użytkownik zostanie również poinformowany o konieczności skontaktowania się z nami w celu zaktualizowania określonych informacji.

6.7. Jesteśmy odpowiedzialni wyłącznie za techniczne świadczenie Usługi (jak opisano szerzej w punkcie 3). Zasadniczo umożliwimy użytkownikowi nawiązywanie kontaktów z innymi członkami. Nie możemy jednak zagwarantować, że użytkownik znajdzie partnera w wyniku korzystania z Usługi.

6.8. Chociaż oczekujemy, że nasi członkowie będą korzystać z Usługi w sposób uprzejmy i pełen szacunku (oraz zgodnie z niniejszymi Warunkami korzystania z usługi), nie ponosimy odpowiedzialności za jakiekolwiek niewłaściwe wykorzystanie danych osobowych udostępnionych za pośrednictwem Usługi; jakiekolwiek inne korzystanie z Usługi przez jej członków, które jest sprzeczne z niniejszymi Warunkami korzystania z usługi; lub jakiekolwiek korzystanie, które jest w inny sposób nieautoryzowane lub niezgodne z prawem. Nie ponosimy również odpowiedzialności za jakiekolwiek niewłaściwe wykorzystanie danych lub informacji przez członków, osoby niebędące członkami lub jakiekolwiek strony trzecie, w przypadku gdy użytkownik przekazał stronie trzeciej takie informacje. Po otrzymaniu przez informacji o takim niewłaściwym użyciu lub niezgodności z prawem Treści (zgodnie z definicją w punkcie 9.2) dostępnych za pośrednictwem naszych Usług podejmiemy jednak niezbędne środki ostrożności, aby zapobiec wszelkim przyszłym nadużyciom i innym naruszeniom niniejszych Warunków korzystania z usługi i obowiązujących przepisów prawa.

6.9. Chociaż ciężko pracujemy, aby zapewnić wysokiej jakości usługi, nie gwarantujemy, że Usługa będzie działać idealnie przez cały czas, i nie możemy zagwarantować, że Usługa będzie zawsze nieprzerwana, bezpieczna lub wolna od błędów. W szczególności nie ponosimy odpowiedzialności za zakłócenia, które wpływają na dostępność Usługi, jeśli takie zakłócenia są spowodowane działaniami lub zdarzeniami będącymi poza naszą kontrolą. Ponadto, chociaż wprowadzamy odpowiednie techniczne i organizacyjne środki bezpieczeństwa w celu ochrony danych osobowych użytkownika, w najszerszym zakresie dozwolonym przez prawo nie będziemy ponosić odpowiedzialności za nieautoryzowany dostęp stron trzecich do danych osobowych użytkownika (np. gdy hakerzy uzyskają nieuprawniony dostęp do naszej bazy danych), jeśli nie jest to spowodowane zawinionym działaniem lub zaniechaniem z naszej strony, w szczególności niepodjęciem wszelkich niezbędnych środków ostrożności w celu zapobieżenia naruszeniom obowiązujących przepisów prawa.

6.10. Ponosimy odpowiedzialność za szkody wynikające z korzystania z Usług w zakresie przepisów ustawowych, niezależnie od podstawy prawnej, wyłącznie zgodnie z poniższymi postanowieniami:

a) Ponosimy nieograniczoną odpowiedzialność za szkody wynikające ze śmierci lub obrażeń ciała, jak również za szkody spowodowane umyślnym działaniem lub rażącym niedbalstwem z naszej strony, ze strony naszych przedstawicieli prawnych lub zastępców, jak również za szkody spowodowane niezgodnością z udzieloną przez nas gwarancją lub nieuczciwie ukrytymi wadami.

b) W przypadku wszystkich innych szkód wynikających z naruszenia istotnych zobowiązań umownych wynikających ze zwykłego zaniedbania przez nas, naszych przedstawicieli prawnych lub zastępców nasza odpowiedzialność będzie oparta na meritum sprawy. Istotne zobowiązania umowne (zobowiązania kardynalne) to takie, których wypełnienie umożliwia przede wszystkim poprawną realizację umowy i na których wypełnieniu partner umowy może zwykle polegać. W takich przypadkach ponosimy odpowiedzialność za odszkodowanie w wysokości typowej dla przewidywalnych szkód w takiej umowie. Wszelka inna odpowiedzialność jest wyłączona.

c) Powyższe postanowienia nie mają wpływu na odpowiedzialność wynikającą z niemieckiej ustawy o odpowiedzialności za produkt.

6.11. Użytkownik jest zobowiązany do podjęcia odpowiednich środków w celu zapobiegania szkód i łagodzenia ich, w szczególności w celu zapewnienia, o ile jest to technicznie możliwe, odpowiedniego bezpieczeństwa swoich danych na urządzeniach wykorzystywanych przez użytkownika. Odpowiedzialność za uszkodzenie lub utratę danych jest ograniczona do typowego wysiłku związanego z odzyskiwaniem danych, który byłby konieczny, gdyby kopie zapasowe były wykonywane regularnie i zgodnie z poziomem ryzyka oraz gdyby zastosowano odpowiednią ochronę antywirusową.

Ponadto możemy nie świadczyć użytkownikowi Usługi do czasu dokonania takiej płatności oraz podjąć kroki w celu odzyskania zaległych opłat zgodnie z prawem. Użytkownik będzie również odpowiedzialny za wszelkie opłaty (a my je naliczymy) z tytułu obciążenia zwrotnego (na przykład od naszych dostawców usług płatniczych) lub wszelkie inne uzasadnione opłaty, które zostaną nałożone na nas w wyniku nieuiszczenia przez użytkownika uzgodnionych opłat.

My również podejmiemy kroki w celu zagwarantowania, że dane użytkownika są dokładne i aktualne.

Użytkownik rozumie, że możemy usunąć wszelkie wiadomości przechowywane na jego koncie po upływie dwunastu miesięcy od daty otrzymania wiadomości, bez konieczności dalszego powiadamiania go o tym.

11.2. Skutki anulowania

Jeśli użytkownik anuluje umowę w ciągu 14-dniowego okresu anulowania, zwrócimy mu wszystkie płatności, które od niego otrzymaliśmy, bez zbędnej zwłoki, a w każdym razie nie później niż w ciągu 14 dni od dnia, w którym zostaliśmy poinformowani o decyzji użytkownika o anulowaniu. Zwrot pieniędzy przekażemy za pomocą tych samych środków płatności, których użytkownik użył do pierwotnej transakcji, chyba że wyraźnie uzgodniono inaczej; użytkownik nie zostanie jednak obciążony kosztem tego zwrotu.

Należy jednak pamiętać, że jeśli użytkownik zaczął korzystać z zakupionych towarów lub usług w ciągu 14-dniowego okresu anulowania, będziemy uprawnieni do zatrzymania ze zwróconej płatności rozsądnej kwoty (rekompensaty za wartość), aby uwzględnić opłatę za tę część towarów lub usług, które użytkownik już otrzymał.

11.3. Należy pamiętać, aby podać adres e-mail powiązany z kontem użytkownika lub porównywalne dane logowania.

11.4. Punkty od 11.1 do 11.3 nie mają zastosowania do anulowania Członkostwa Premium zakupionego od Apple za pośrednictwem aplikacji z systemem iOS lub od Google za pośrednictwem aplikacji z systemem Android. Więcej informacji znajduje się w punkcie 2.4. Firma Apple/Google może również zapewnić dodatkowe mechanizmy umożliwiające anulowanie subskrypcji. Aby anulować Członkostwo Premium zakupione od Apple za pośrednictwem aplikacji z systemem iOS lub od Google za pośrednictwem aplikacji z systemem Android, należy zapoznać się z instrukcjami dotyczącymi anulowania, które udostępniono [tutaj](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202039) (Apple) i [tutaj](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2479637?hl=en-GB#apps) (Google).

**12\. Prawa użytkownika**

Użytkownik ma prawo wymagać, aby Usługa była zgodna z opisem, odpowiednia do celu i zadowalającej jakości. Jeśli użytkownik zakupi Członkostwo Premium i treści, które mu dostarczamy, są wadliwe, użytkownik ma prawo do naprawy lub wymiany; lub, jeśli usterka nie może zostać naprawiona bądź nie może zostać naprawiona w rozsądnym czasie i bez znaczących niedogodności, może być uprawniony do pełnego lub częściowego zwrotu pieniędzy. Jeśli użytkownik może wykazać, że usterka uszkodziła jego urządzenie, a my nie wykazaliśmy należytej staranności i umiejętności, może być uprawniony do jego naprawy na nasz koszt lub odszkodowania.

**13\. Postanowienia różne**

16.2. Uzyskując dostęp do funkcji Pets i akceptując niniejsze warunki, użytkownik rozumie i zgadza się na udział w grze Pets dołączonej do Usługi. Użytkownik rozumie i zgadza się, że gra Pets umożliwia innym członkom dostęp do opisów i podobizn jego profilu, a ci członkowie mogą wykorzystywać te opisy i podobizny na różne sposoby. To wykorzystanie może obejmować wyznaczanie użytkownika i innych członków jako „zwierząt domowych”, które członkowie mogą „posiadać” i „sprzedawać” (za Towary wirtualne) innym członkom. Możemy określić „wartość” związaną z każdym zwierzęciem domowym na podstawie ustalonych przez nas kryteriów, które mogą obejmować liczbę i częstotliwość „sprzedaży” z udziałem tego zwierzęcia. Wartość przypisana do każdego zwierzęcia domowego może zmieniać się w czasie. Firma może publikować rankingi i inne dane, które zawierają odniesienia lub obliczenia wartości zwierząt domowych posiadanych przez członków. Stając się członkiem, użytkownik nieodwołalnie zezwala, upoważnia, udziela i licencjonuje nam oraz naszym podmiotom stowarzyszonym, następcom prawnym i cesjonariuszom prawo do korzystania i zezwalania innym, w tym innym członkom, na wykorzystywanie jego wizerunku, podobieństwa, wyglądu, informacji profilowych lub innych cech osobistych w związku z działaniem gry Pets lub innymi operacjami Usługi, bezterminowo, bez dalszej zgody użytkownika i bez tantiem, płatności lub innego wynagrodzenia.

Sjabloon voor het herroepingsformulier

**1\. Beschrijving van Dienst**

1.1. Nadat je je voor een account hebt geregistreerd, geven wij je toegang tot een online platform waar je andere geregistreerde klanten (ook wel leden genoemd) kunt leren kennen. De Dienst is alleen toegankelijk via mobiele apps op iOS- en Android-toestellen (hoewel er in de toekomst misschien andere besturingssystemen beschikbaar kunnen komen) of via onze Tagged- en/of Hi5-website (bepaalde functies zijn alleen beschikbaar via de mobiele app of op internet). De Dienst omvat een aantal gratis en een aantal betaalde diensten.

1.2. De Dienst bevat 'profielen' van leden die inhoud bevatten (ook wel 'gegevens' genoemd) die door deze leden beschikbaar is gesteld. Je vindt meer informatie over de soorten persoonlijke gegevens die we verzamelen en hoe deze gegevens aan andere leden beschikbaar worden gesteld in ons [Privacybeleid](https://secure.tagged.com/terms_of_service.html?#privacy_policy) (zie Clausule 5 hieronder). We bieden onze Dienst wereldwijd aan en onze leden kunnen naar andere leden zoeken en contact met ze opnemen in alle landen waarin we actief zijn.

**2\. Toegang tot de Dienst en het afsluiten van je Abonnement**

2.1. Om toegang te krijgen tot de Dienst en er gebruik van te maken, moet je je registreren. Om dit te doen, moet je een beschikbare registratieoptie kiezen, zoals e-mail, sms, Inloggen met Apple, Inloggen met Google of Facebook, en aanmeldgegevens opgeven, zoals een e-mailadres en een wachtwoord naar keuze. Je bent er zelf voor verantwoordelijk om je wachtwoord en accountgegevens vertrouwelijk te houden. Verder ben je ook verantwoordelijk voor alle verwijtbare activiteiten die via jouw account plaatsvinden. Je gaat ermee akkoord om ons onmiddellijk op de hoogte te stellen van elk onrechtmatig gebruik van je account of van enig ander beveiligingslek zodra je hiervan weet.

2.2. Wanneer je je geregistreerd hebt, krijg je toegang tot onze gratis Dienst ('Basislidmaatschap').

2.3. Wie bieden ook verschillende diensten of functies aan waarvoor je moet betalen. Voordat je je registreert om dergelijke diensten of functies te kopen, geven we je meer informatie over wat je gaat kopen, zoals, indien van toepassing: de belangrijkste kenmerken van de diensten of functies, de looptijd van je abonnement (inclusief eventuele verlenging), hoe je je abonnement kunt opzeggen, de prijs en eventuele betalingsvoorwaarden en beperkingen van de betaalmiddelen. Als je Virtuele Goederen koopt (zie Clausule 3.3 hieronder), informeren we je verder dat je deze alleen op de Dienst kunt inwisselen voor digitale producten en inhoud en dat ze niet kunnen worden terugbetaald. Als je je Basislidmaatschap wilt upgraden door voor een betaald lidmaatschap te kiezen ('Premium-lidmaatschap') of toegang wilt krijgen tot andere betaalde diensten of functies, erken je dat je door op de knop 'Nu kopen' (of een vergelijkbare knop) te drukken, je bevestigt dat je het Premium-lidmaatschap of de andere diensten of functies die je hebt geselecteerd wilt kopen. Onze contractuele relatie voor dergelijke aankopen wordt bevestigd op de datum waarop je een bevestiging van je bestelling ontvangt. Houd er echter rekening mee dat de uitvoering van je betalingsplicht jegens ons onderhevig is aan de verificatie en verwerking van de aankoop door de relevante betalingsdienstaanbieder.

2.4. Je kunt ook aankopen doen via onze Apple iOS-app of Google Android-app. Dit omvat de aankoop van een Premium-lidmaatschap of enige andere betaalde diensten of functies. In dit geval blijven wij verantwoordelijk voor de levering van onze Dienst. Je ontvangt een orderbevestiging over je Abonnementsvoorwaarden na een dergelijke aankoop. Maar alle aankopen en/of abonnementen worden uitsluitend afgesloten (en moeten worden geannuleerd of beëindigd) via Apple/Google (zie Clausule 5.3) en zijn onderworpen aan de technische standaarden en beginselen zoals vastgesteld door Apple/Google. Wij hebben hier geen controle over. In de regel vindt een aankoop via een app store plaats wanneer je op 'Nu kopen' (of een vergelijkbare knop) klikt en, indien vereist, je wachtwoord of vergelijkbare aanmeldgegevens voor de app store (zoals Touch ID of Face ID) invoert. Je contractuele relatie met Apple/Google wordt bevestigd op de datum waarop Apple/Google je een e-mail stuurt met een bevestiging van je bestelling. Apple/Google factureert je voor alle kosten voor je Premium-lidmaatschap via je Apple-/Google-account. In de app store vind je ook alle belangrijke informatie over je contractuele relatie met Apple/Google. Als je via de app store een Premium-lidmaatschap koopt dat automatisch verlengd wordt, heeft het Premium-lidmaatschap een vaste looptijd die automatisch wordt verlengd, tenzij je je abonnement bij Apple/Google beëindigt in overeenstemming met de Servicevoorwaarden van Apple/Google. Clausules 5.3 en 12 van deze Servicevoorwaarden zijn niet van toepassing indien je een Premium-lidmaatschap via Apple/Google hebt gekocht.

2.5. Zie ook Clausules 14 en 15 hieronder voor de voorwaarden die van toepassing zijn als je onze app via Apple of Google hebt gedownload. Als je onze app in de app store van Apple/Google gedownload hebt, zijn de servicevoorwaarden van Apple/Google van toepassing en hebben voorrang hebben over deze Servicevoorwaarden in geval van een conflict.

**3\. Gratis en betaalde Diensten en aankopen**

3.1. Je kunt je gratis voor de Dienst registreren en gebruikmaken van ons Basislidmaatschap.

3.2. Je kunt besluiten om je lidmaatschap te upgraden naar een Premium-status ('Premium-lidmaatschap') voor een aanvullend maandelijks bedrag. Als je ervoor kiest om een Premium-lidmaatschap te kopen, wordt je lidmaatschap automatisch maandelijks verlengd.

3.3. Je kunt 'Virtuele Goederen' kopen die je alleen op de Dienst kunt gebruiken (zoals virtueel 'Gold'). Aankopen of andere verwervingen van Virtuele Goederen bieden slechts een beperkte, niet overdraagbare, niet sublicentieerbare, volledig herroepbare licentie om dergelijke Virtuele Goederen te gebruiken voor toegang tot diensten die wij uitdrukkelijk beschikbaar stellen voor gebruik met dergelijke Virtuele Goederen voor jouw persoonlijke, niet-commerciële gebruik (zoals live animaties, zogenaamde virtuele 'Kado's'). Virtuele Goederen kunnen alleen op de Dienst worden ingewisseld tegen digitale producten en inhoud. Virtuele Goederen vervallen niet. Virtuele Goederen kunnen niet worden terugbetaald. Virtuele Goederen hebben geen geldelijke waarde en vormen geen valuta of eigendom van enig type. Virtuele Goederen zijn niet overdraagbaar of toewijsbaar. Je hebt geen recht op terugbetaling, geld of enige andere compensatie voor ongebruikte Virtuele Goederen wanneer een account wordt gesloten omdat je deze Servicevoorwaarden op ernstige wijze geschonden hebt of wanneer je besluit je account te sluiten.

3.4. Je kunt Virtuele Goederen gebruiken om Kado's te kopen voor andere gebruikers van onze app of andere apps die je kunt zien. De prijs van ieder Kado wordt weergegeven bij het aankooppunt. Kado's vormen een beperkte licentie voor toegang tot een bepaalde functie op de Dienst.

3.5. Af en toe kunnen we ook bepaalde aanvullende diensten aanbieden, zoals winkel- en e-commerceproducten en verschillende informatieve diensten.

3.6. We kunnen de Dienst wijzigen: (i) als gevolg van veranderingen in relevante wetten en wettelijke vereisten of (ii) om kleine technische veranderingen en verbeteringen te implementeren, bijvoorbeeld om een veiligheidsbedreiging aan te pakken (maar deze wijzigingen zijn niet van invloed op jouw gebruik van de Dienst). Daarnaast kunnen we, hoewel we op onze website een beschrijving van onze Dienst geven, de belangrijkste kenmerken van onze Dienst af en toe wijzigen, zonder extra kosten voor jou. Maar als we dit doen, stellen we je een redelijke periode voordat de verandering ingaat hiervan op de hoogte. Je kunt dan contact met ons opnemen om binnen 30 dagen na kennisgeving over een dergelijke verandering je abonnement op te zeggen als deze verandering je toegang tot de Diensten of je gebruik van de Diensten belemmert en als een dergelijke belemmering niet slechts onbeduidend is voordat de wijzigingen van kracht worden (en als je bij ons een Premium-lidmaatschap hebt afgesloten, ontvang je van ons een terugbetaling voor het gedeelte van de dienst waarvoor je betaald hebt, maar dat je niet hebt ontvangen omdat je je abonnement eerder hebt opgezegd). Een dergelijke kennisgeving informeert je over de aard van de verandering en de reden hiervoor, het moment waarop de verandering ingaat en je recht om je abonnement binnen 30 dagen na een dergelijke kennisgeving op te zeggen in overeenstemming met deze Clausule 3.6.

**4\. Gebruik van gegevens**

4.1. Je kunt meer informatie vinden over hoe we je persoonlijke gegevens gebruiken of anderszins verwerken en over onze verplichtingen in verband met gegevensbescherming in ons [Privacybeleid](https://secure.tagged.com/terms_of_service.html?#privacy_policy).

4.2. We streven er voortdurend naar om jou tegen overlast zoals aanvallen van hackers, spam of romantische fraude te beschermen. Hiervoor hebben we een groot aantal technische en organisatorische standaarden ontwikkeld. Het is jouw verantwoordelijkheid om de gebruikersrichtlijnen in Clausule 8 hieronder te volgen. Je kunt in geval van onregelmatigheden worden gecontacteerd door ons 'Team vertrouwen en veiligheid', om deze onregelmatigheden op te lossen. In dat geval vermelden we in detail om welke redenen we contact met je opnemen. Je bent verplicht om mee te werken en binnen een redelijke termijn op een dergelijk verzoek te reageren. Als we acties aanbevelen, moet je deze serieus overwegen. In geval je een aanbevolen actie afwijst, ben je verplicht om ons hierover binnen een redelijke termijn te informeren en de redenen op te geven waarom je onze voorgestelde actie afwijst. Je moet problematische inhoud of gedrag ook aan ons melden via de meldfunctie.

4.3. We kunnen onbeantwoorde berichten die vanaf of naar profielen verstuurd zijn en die als spam of romantische fraude geïdentificeerd of anderszins verwijderd zijn, automatisch verwijderen.

**5\. Beëindiging/verlenging**

**Zie Paragraaf 11 als je je Premium-abonnement wilt annuleren binnen de opzeg- of herroepingsperiode van 14 dagen (je recht om te annuleren).**

5.1. Je kunt je Basislidmaatschap op ieder moment met onmiddellijke ingang beëindigen in je accountinstellingen of door contact met ons op te nemen ([support@themeetgroup.com](mailto:support@themeetgroup.com)).

5.2. Als je Basislidmaatschap actieve Virtuele Goederen bevat, moet je de beëindiging aan ons doorgeven via [support@themeetgroup.com](mailto:support@themeetgroup.com). Verstrek daarbij het aan je account gekoppelde e-mailadres of vergelijkbare gegevens waarmee we je kunnen identificeren.

5.3. Als je op enig moment je Premium-lidmaatschap wilt beëindigen, staat het je vrij dit te doen. Als je Premium-lidmaatschapsaccount via onze website wordt gefactureerd, moet je naar [http://www.tagged.com/account\_info.html](http://www.tagged.com/account_info.html) gaan, op Abonnementen klikken en vervolgens op het tabblad Betalingen 'je abonnement opzeggen' selecteren en op 'Premium opzeggen' klikken. Je moet dit minimaal drie dagen voor je volgende geplande automatische betaling doen, zodat we je opzegging correct kunnen verwerken. Als je dat niet doet, kun je nog steeds aan het einde van de betreffende abonnementstermijn opzeggen, maar mogelijk innen we dan wel het geld voor de volgende termijn. Dit betalen we je vervolgens terug. Dit is niet van invloed op je recht om je Premium-lidmaatschap om andere redenen te beëindigen. In dat geval moet je de redenen voor buitengewone beëindiging aangeven wanneer je je abonnement op deze grond opzegt. Als je Premium-lidmaatschapsaccount via Apple wordt gefactureerd, moet je het minimaal 24 uur voor je volgende geplande automatische betaling opzeggen. Dit doe je door het proces te volgen dat hier [hier](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039) wordt beschreven. Als je Premium-lidmaatschapsaccount via Google Play wordt gefactureerd, moet je binnen zeven dagen na het begin van je factureringscyclus opzeggen door het proces te volgen dat [hier](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid) wordt uitgelegd. Je kunt ook naar ons schrijven via de contactgegevens die hieronder in Clausule 16 vermeld staan. Behoudens Clausule 5.5 en Clausule 11 hieronder gaat geen enkele beëindiging van je abonnement in voor het einde van de lopende factureringsperiode (en je hebt dan ook geen recht op enige terugbetaling). Om ervoor te zorgen dat je Premium-lidmaatschap niet automatisch wordt verlengd, moet je ons dus voor het einde van de dan lopende abonnementsperiode vertellen dat je je abonnement wilt beëindigen.

5.4. Als je je Basis- of Premium-lidmaatschap verwijdert, worden eerder gekochte Virtuele Goederen ook verwijderd en blijven bestaande betalingsverplichtingen die voortkomen uit de aanschaf van betaalde diensten of functies (zoals Virtuele Goederen) gelden, behoudens toepasselijke annuleringsrechten (zie Clausule 12).

5.5. Om je identiteit en je verzoek tot beëindiging te authenticeren, moet je het aan je account gekoppelde e-mailadres of andere persoonlijke gegevens verstrekken waarmee we je kunnen identificeren.

5.6. Als je ervoor kiest om een Premium-lidmaatschap te kopen, wordt je lidmaatschap automatisch maandelijks verlengd, tenzij je je abonnement in overeenstemming met deze paragraaf opzegt.

5.7. Als je je Premium-lidmaatschap beëindigt, wordt je account teruggezet naar een Basislidmaatschap. Als je je Basislidmaatschap wilt beëindigen, volg je de procedure die in Clausule 5.1 wordt beschreven.

5.8. Als je behoudens Clausule 5.4 en in overeenstemming met Clausule 3.6 je Premium-lidmaatschap wilt beëindigen omdat we je hebben verteld over een op handen zijnde substantiële verandering aan onze Dienst, wordt je abonnement onmiddellijk beëindigd wanneer we hiervan van jou schriftelijke kennisgeving (bijvoorbeeld een e-mail of fax) hebben ontvangen. We betalen je enig deel van je Premium-lidmaatschap terug dat we niet hebben geleverd. Als je je Premium-lidmaatschap via Apple/Google hebt gekocht, zal enige annulering en terugbetaling geschieden in overeenstemming met de eigen voorwaarden van Apple/Google, zoals verder beschreven in Clausules 2.4 en 5.3.

**6\. Functionaliteit, compatibiliteit, interoperabiliteit, garanties en aansprakelijkheid**

6.1. Hoewel we ons uiterste best doen, kunnen we niet garanderen dat de Dienst 100% van de tijd beschikbaar zal zijn. De beschikbaarheid van onze Dienst kan worden beperkt vanwege onderhoud en updates aan software of door periodes waarin de Dienst niet beschikbaar is vanwege technische of andere problemen die buiten onze macht liggen.

6.2. Sommige functies zijn alleen beschikbaar via de website of de app. Het is niet mogelijk om via onder meer de mobiele app toegang te krijgen tot of gebruik te maken van bepaalde functies, zoals Tags, Luv en het aanpassen van webprofielen. De Live-functie kun je alleen via de mobiele app bekijken en gebruiken.

6.3. Hoewel we onze Diensten gratis aanbieden op de mobiele websites, zijn de standaardtarieven van je mobiele provider nog steeds van toepassing. Je aanvaardt de verantwoordelijkheid voor alle kosten.

6.4. Om alles uit de Dienst te kunnen halen, moet je gebruikmaken van up-to-date (browser-)technologieën op je mobiele toestel of computer (zoals het inschakelen van JavaScript, cookies en pop-ups). Als je gebruikt maakt van een ouder besturingssysteem of internetprovider, kan je gebruik van de Dienst beperkt zijn. Wanneer je de app gebruikt, kunnen je mobiele toestel, besturingssysteem of geselecteerde instellingen bepaalde functies van de app (zoals pushberichten, zoeken op afstand) beperken.

6.5. In geval we productupdates aanbieden, waaronder updates voor onze Android- en iOS-apps, raden we je sterk aan deze zo snel mogelijk te installeren. Het is jouw verantwoordelijkheid om dergelijke updates binnen een redelijke termijn te installeren. Als je dit niet doet, hoewel we je ervan op de hoogte hebben gesteld dat er een update beschikbaar is en we je hebben geïnformeerd over de gevolgen als je deze niet installeert, zijn wij niet verantwoordelijk voor eventuele productgebreken die voortkomen uit het niet installeren van de update. Dit is niet van toepassing als je de update niet hebt geïnstalleerd of onjuist hebt geïnstalleerd als gevolg van ontoereikende installatie-instructies die wij aan jou hebben verstrekt.

6.6. Je bent verantwoordelijk voor de nauwkeurigheid van de gegevens die je tijdens je registratie hebt verstrekt. Als je je profiel of registratie-informatie moet bijwerken, kun je dit in principe op elk gewenst moment doen via je profiel. Maar er zijn gegevens die alleen kunnen worden bijgewerkt door contact met ons op te nemen via de gegevens in Clausule 16. We laten het ook aan je weten als je contact met ons moet opnemen om specifieke gegevens bij te werken.

6.7. We zijn alleen verantwoordelijk voor de technische levering van de Dienst (zoals verder beschreven in Clausule 3). We stellen je in principe in staat om contact te leggen met andere leden. We kunnen echter niet garanderen dat je als gevolg van je gebruik van de Dienst een partner zult vinden.

6.8. Hoewel we van onze leden verwachten dat ze de Dienst op een vriendelijke en respectvolle manier (en in overeenstemming met deze Servicevoorwaarden) gebruiken, zijn we niet verantwoordelijk voor eventueel misbruik van persoonlijke gegevens die via de Dienst beschikbaar zijn gesteld, voor enig gebruik van de Dienst door zijn leden dat in strijd is met deze Servicevoorwaarden of enig ander gebruik dat anderszins ongeoorloofd of onrechtmatig is. We zijn ook niet verantwoordelijk voor enig misbruik van gegevens of informatie door leden, niet-leden of derden in geval je deze derden van dergelijke informatie hebt voorzien. Maar zodra we op de hoogte worden gesteld van dergelijk misbruik of onwettigheid van Inhoud (zoals gedefinieerd in Clausule 9.2) via onze Diensten, nemen wij de noodzakelijke voorzorgsmaatregelen om toekomstig misbruik en andere inbreuken op deze Servicevoorwaarden en de toepasselijke wetten te voorkomen.

6.9. Hoewel we hard werken om een hoogwaardige dienst te leveren, kunnen we niet garanderen dat de Dienst altijd perfect werkt. We kunnen ook niet garanderen dat de Dienst altijd ononderbroken, veilig of vrij van fouten zal zijn. We zijn in het bijzonder niet aansprakelijk voor storingen die de toegankelijkheid van de Dienst aantasten in geval dergelijke storingen worden veroorzaakt door acties of gebeurtenissen die buiten onze macht liggen. Verder zijn we, hoewel we passende technische en organisatorische veiligheidsmaatregelen treffen om je persoonlijke gegevens te beschermen, voor zover toegestaan door de wet niet aansprakelijk voor enig ongeoorloofde toegang door derden tot je persoonlijke gegevens (bijvoorbeeld doordat hackers ongeoorloofde toegang tot onze database krijgen) als dit niet te wijten is aan een verwijtbare actie of verzuim van onze zijde, in het bijzonder het niet nemen van alle noodzakelijke voorzorgsmaatregelen om enige overtredingen van de toepasselijke wetten te voorkomen.

6.10. We zijn alleen aansprakelijk voor schade die voortvloeit uit het gebruik van de Diensten binnen het bestek van de wettelijke bepalingen, ongeacht de wettelijke gronden, in overeenstemming met de volgende bepalingen:

a) Wij zijn zonder beperking aansprakelijk voor schade die voortvloeit uit overlijden of persoonlijk letsel, evenals voor schade veroorzaakt door opzet of grove nalatigheid door ons, onze wettelijke vertegenwoordigers of plaatsvervangers, en voor schade veroorzaakt door het niet naleven van een door ons gegeven garantie of door onrechtmatig verborgen gebreken.

b) Voor alle andere schade die het gevolg is van een schending van essentiële contractuele verplichtingen die voortkomen uit eenvoudige nalatigheid door ons, onze wettelijke vertegenwoordigers of plaatsvervangers, is onze aansprakelijkheid op basis van de feiten van de zaak. Essentiële contractuele verplichtingen (kardinale verplichtingen) zijn verplichtingen waarvan het nakomen de correcte implementatie van het contract in de eerste plaats mogelijk maakt en op welk nakomen de contractuele partner normaal gesproken mag vertrouwen. In zulke gevallen zijn wij aansprakelijk voor een schadevergoeding ter hoogte van een gebruikelijk bedrag voor voorzienbare schade in een dergelijk contract. In andere gevallen is aansprakelijkheid uitgesloten.

c) De aansprakelijkheid onder de Duitse productaansprakelijkheidswet blijft onaangetast door bovenstaande bepalingen.

6.11. Je bent verplicht passende maatregelen te nemen om schade te voorkomen en te beperken, in het bijzonder om waar technisch mogelijk te zorgen voor passende beveiliging van je gegevens op je toestellen. De aansprakelijkheid voor beschadiging of verlies van gegevens is beperkt tot de gebruikelijke poging tot herstel die nodig zou zijn geweest als er regelmatig back-upkopieën zouden zijn gemaakt in overeenstemming met het risiconiveau en er voldoende virusbescherming zou zijn gebruikt.

**7\. Verantwoordelijkheid en plichten van de klant**

7.1. Als je een Premium-lidmaatschap en/of andere betaalde diensten of functies aanschaft, stem je ermee in alle kosten te betalen, zoals uiteengezet in de Abonnementsvoorwaarden (en indien van toepassing enige aanvullende voorwaarden, zoals de servicevoorwaarden van de app stores van Apple/Google). Daarnaast leveren we je de Dienst mogelijk niet tot een dergelijke betaling is gedaan en kunnen we stappen ondernemen om je openstaande betalingen terug te vorderen, zoals toegestaan door de wet. Je bent ook verantwoordelijk (en ontvangt van ons een rekening) voor enige terugboekingskosten (bijvoorbeeld van onze betalingsdienstaanbieders) of enige andere redelijke kosten die wij oplopen als gevolg van jouw verzuim de overeengekomen kosten te betalen.

7.2. Zoals hierboven vermeld, ben je verantwoordelijk voor de nauwkeurigheid van de inhoud die je bij registratie verstrekt en voor alle gegevens die je over jezelf verstrekt in je profiel. Door ons van deze gegevens te voorzien, ga je ermee akkoord en bevestig je dat deze gegevens waarheidsgetrouw en nauwkeurig zijn. We ondernemen ook stappen om te garanderen dat je gegevens nauwkeurig en up-to-date blijven. Opzettelijke en/of onrechtmatige misleiding wat betreft je identiteit, inclusief gebruik van een andere of fictieve identiteit, kan je ook blootstellen aan mogelijke wettelijke aansprakelijkheid.

7.3. Je stemt ermee in dat je de inhoud die wij je leveren en/of inhoud die door gebruik van onze Diensten wordt verkregen, inclusief gegevens over derden (inclusief andere leden) niet zult gebruiken voor commerciële of reclamedoeleinden. Het is in het bijzonder niet toegestaan om technologische methodes of processen te gebruiken om informatie over andere leden automatisch te downloaden of anderszins te bekijken om deze informatie buiten de Dienst te gebruiken (bijvoorbeeld door een computerprogramma of door de inhoud te kopiëren en te plakken). Je stemt er ook mee in dat het gebruik van computerprogramma's om bestanden met ledengegevens automatisch te lezen (zoals crawlers) verboden is.

7.4. Als je deze Servicevoorwaarden wezenlijk schendt of anderszins de wet overtreedt in verband met je gebruik van onze Dienst, kunnen we het recht hebben om schadevergoeding te eisen in overeenstemming met de toepasselijke wetgeving.

7.5. E-mails en andere berichten die je via of in verband met de Dienst ontvangt, behandel vertrouwelijk en maak je niet openbaar aan derden zonder toestemming van de afzender of een serieuze aanleiding. Deze zelfde regels zijn ook van toepassing op namen, telefoon- en faxnummers, adressen, e-mailadressen en/of url's of andere persoonlijke gegevens van andere leden.

7.6. Je stemt ermee in dat je berichten die je ontvangt (en informatie in je profiel die je wilt bewaren) regelmatig en met passende tussenpozen ophaalt en, indien noodzakelijk, dat je deze informatie op je eigen computer of een ander systeem voor gegevensopslag archiveert. Je begrijpt dat we in je account opgeslagen berichten na een periode van twaalf maanden, geteld vanaf de datum waarop het bericht was verzonden, kunnen verwijderen, zonder verdere kennisgeving aan jou. Als je een Basislid bent, begrijp je dat al je gegevens die betrekking hebben op je lopende Basislidmaatschap, automatisch worden verwijderd als je profiel meer dan vierentwintig maanden inactief is.

7.7. Iedere gebruiker is verplicht zich aan het [Inhouds- en gedragsbeleid](https://terms.tagged.com/content-and-conduct) te houden. Daarnaast is het niet toegestaan:

* om te proberen ongeautoriseerde toegang tot onze database of andere computersystemen te krijgen;
    
* te proberen enige door ons in verband met deze Dienst gebruikte softwareprogramma's te veranderen, vertalen, aanpassen, bewerken, decompileren, demonteren of reverse-engineeren;
    
* je in te laten met activiteiten die de Dienst verstoren, de kwaliteit ervan verminderen, invloed hebben op de prestaties van de Dienst of de functionaliteit ervan schaden;
    
* om op enig moment het account, de gebruikersnaam of het wachtwoord van een ander lid te gebruiken of diens wachtwoord aan derden bekend te maken of het enige derde partij toe te staan om toegang te krijgen tot diens account;
    
* om te proberen Virtuele Goederen buiten de Dienst te kopen;
    
* te proberen Virtuele Goederen te verkopen; en/of
    

7.8. te proberen een gebruikersaccount te verkopen dat gekoppeld is aan een van de Diensten. Als je je niet houdt aan de gedragseisen die in deze Clausule 7 worden uitgelegd of als je niet voldoet aan een wezenlijke verplichting in de Abonnementsvoorwaarden, kunnen we, als dit onder de omstandigheden van het specifieke geval redelijk is, een of meerdere van de volgende acties ondernemen: we kunnen je vragen te stoppen met je activiteiten die tegen de voorwaarden ingaan (of je anderszins een waarschuwing sturen dat je activiteiten niet voldoen aan onze gedragseisen); we kunnen enige inhoud die je via de Dienst hebt ingediend en die strijdig is met onze gedragseisen verwijderen; we kunnen de levering van de Dienst aan jou (geheel of gedeeltelijk) opschorten tot het probleem is opgelost (bijvoorbeeld terwijl we je activiteiten onderzoeken); of (als het ons duidelijk is dat je serieus misbruik maakt van de Dienst) we kunnen de levering van de Dienst aan jou stopzetten. Als je je Premium-lidmaatschap via Apple/Google hebt aangeschaft, vinden eventuele terugbetalingen plaats in overeenstemming met de eigen voorwaarden van Apple/Google zoals verder beschreven in Clausule 2.4.

**8\. Communicatie**

8.1. Communicatie op het platform moet altijd plaatsvinden in overeenstemming met deze Servicevoorwaarden, in het bijzonder de voorwaarden met betrekking tot veiligheid bij gebruik van de Dienst (zie Clausule 4) en het [Inhouds- en gedragsbeleid](https://terms.tagged.com/content-and-conduct).

8.2. Deze Diensten zijn online diensten. Als zodanig communiceren we over het algemeen met jou via online methoden zoals e-mail of via informatieschermen op onze mobiele apps en website. Als digitale dienst wordt onze Dienst alleen online geleverd. Daarom kun je je alleen online voor onze Dienst registreren, je abonneren en de Dienst gebruiken.

8.3. Om te garanderen dat we geen ongeoorloofde verzoeken ontvangen (en om je account tegen misbruik te beschermen), vragen we je om het je account gekoppelde e-mailadres of vergelijkbare inloggegevens te verstrekken, zodat we je kunnen identificeren.

**9\. Gebruiksrechten en auteursrecht**

9.1. Door onze Dienst te gebruik je, begrijp je en stem je ermee in dat wij de enige eigenaar zijn van alle rechten op en gerelateerd aan de Dienst, inclusief enige rechten op reproductie, distributie en verwerking, alle auteursrechten en het recht op immateriële overdracht en reproductie van de Tagged- en/of Hi5-website en de inhoud op deze websites. Het gebruik van alle programma's, inhoud, materialen, handelsmerken en handelsnamen binnen de Dienst is alleen toegestaan voor de doelen die in deze Servicevoorwaarden worden uiteengezet.

9.2. Door onze Dienst te gebruiken, begrijp je en stem je ermee in dat de Inhoud (gedefinieerd als alle gegevens, tekst, software, muziek, geluid, foto's, illustraties, video's, foto's, afbeeldingen, posts, uitzendingen, berichten of ander materiaal van welke aard dan ook, publiek geplaatst of privé verzonden) die door jou wordt gepubliceerd jouw eigen verantwoordelijkheid is. Je bent je ervan bewust dat als je Inhoud openbaar beschikbaar stelt, deze Inhoud door andere gebruikers kan worden gezien en dat andere gebruikers hier mogelijk misbruik van kunnen maken, oftewel de Inhoud kunnen gebruiken voor andere doeleinden dan waarvoor de Inhoud door jou beschikbaar is gesteld. Je verklaart en garandeert dat jij eigenaar bent of de noodzakelijke licenties, rechten, toestemmingen en machtigingen hebt om al je Inhoud te publiceren. We beschikken over systemen om de geplaatste Inhoud regelmatig te controleren op naleving van deze Servicevoorwaarden en de toepasselijke wetten, in het bijzonder om misbruik van je gegevens te voorkomen, maar we hebben de geplaatste Inhoud niet volledig onder controle en als zodanig hebben we ook de nauwkeurigheid, integriteit, kwaliteit of enig ander aspect ervan niet in de hand. Onder geen enkele omstandigheid zijn wij op enige wijze aansprakelijk voor enige Inhoud, inclusief maar niet beperkt tot enige fouten of lacunes in enige Inhoud of enige verliezen of schade van welke aard dan ook, opgelopen als gevolg van het gebruik van enige Inhoud.

9.3. Je geeft het Bedrijf hierbij het recht om dergelijke Inhoud (inclusief je gebruikersnaam en beeltenis) te distribueren, te reproduceren, vast te leggen, te wijzigen, aan te passen, te verwerken, te combineren, te synchroniseren, er afgeleide werken van te creëren, te publiceren, in het openbaar uit te voeren en in het openbaar weer te geven op de Diensten. Dit recht geldt alleen om onze Diensten aan jou te leveren in overeenstemming met deze Algemene voorwaarden.

9.4. Deze licentie geeft het Bedrijf het recht om je Inhoud beschikbaar te stellen aan de rest van de wereld en anderen hetzelfde te laten doen. Je gaat ermee akkoord dat deze licentie het recht van het Bedrijf omvat om de Diensten te leveren, te promoten en te verbeteren, en om de Inhoud die naar of via de Diensten wordt verzonden beschikbaar te stellen aan andere bedrijven, organisaties of personen voor de syndicatie, uitzending, distributie, promotie of publicatie van dergelijke Inhoud via andere media en diensten, behoudens de Servicevoorwaarden van het Bedrijf voor dergelijk gebruik van Inhoud. Dergelijk aanvullende gebruik door het Bedrijf of door andere bedrijven, organisaties of personen kan plaatsvinden zonder dat er een vergoeding aan jou betaald wordt in verband met de Inhoud die je verzendt, post, doorstuurt of anderszins ter beschikking stelt via de Diensten.

9.5. Het Bedrijf kan je feedback, reacties en suggesties gebruiken zonder enige verplichting om je daarvoor een vergoeding aan te bieden. Het Bedrijf kan alle Inhoud blijven gebruiken en beschikbaar stellen en het Bedrijf behoudt al deze rechten, zelfs als je account wordt beëindigd.

9.6. Je erkent en gaat ermee akkoord dat het Bedrijf niet belooft om de Inhoud die op de Dienst beschikbaar wordt gesteld regelmatig te screenen. Je begrijpt dat we enige door jou op de Dienst beschikbaar gestelde informatie of Inhoud kunnen verwijderen of weigeren te plaatsen als de Inhoud inbreuk maakt op deze Servicevoorwaarden of enige andere toepasselijke wet. We kunnen bijvoorbeeld Inhoud verwijderen als die inbreuk maakt op deze Servicevoorwaarden of anderszins aanstootgevend is. Je aanvaardt de aansprakelijkheid die gepaard gaat met enig gebruik van de Inhoud, inclusief maar niet beperkt tot je vertrouwen op de nauwkeurigheid, volledigheid of bruikbaarheid van dergelijke Inhoud. Je mag Inhoud op de Diensten die jou niet toebehoort niet reproduceren, opnieuw publiceren, verder distribueren of in het openbaar tentoonstellen.

**10\. Geldend recht/buitengerechtelijke geschillenbeslechting in consumentenzaken**

10.1. Deze Servicevoorwaarden worden beheerst door en geïnterpreteerd in overeenstemming met de wetten van de staat Californië in de VS, zonder rekening te houden met eventuele conflicterende rechtsbeginselen. Deze rechtskeuze is echter niet van toepassing als deze tot resultaat heeft dat je de bescherming wordt ontnomen die je wordt geboden door bepalingen waarvan niet kan worden afgeweken op grond van de wet die, bij gebreke van een rechtskeuze, van toepassing zou zijn geweest op basis van wettelijke bepalingen.

10.2. Onder de huidige wet zijn we verplicht om consumenten te informeren over het bestaan van het Europese platform voor onlinegeschillenbeslechting, dat is opgericht door de Europese Commissie voor geschillenbeslechting. Je kunt het Europese platform voor onlinegeschillenbeslechting hier vinden: [https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/). De contactgegevens van de officiële geschillenbeslechtingsorganen zijn te vinden via de volgende link: [https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/odr/main/index.cfm](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/odr/main/index.cfm). Bij gebrek aan een wettelijke verplichting om deel te nemen aan geschillenbeslechtingsprocedures bij een orgaan voor de beslechting van consumentengeschillen zijn wij niet verplicht en ook niet bereid om deel te nemen aan dergelijke geschillenbeslechtingsprocedures. Ons e-mailadres staat in Clausule 16.

10.3. Mocht een bepaling van deze Servicevoorwaarden geheel of gedeeltelijk ondoeltreffend of onuitvoerbaar zijn of worden, dan heeft dat geen invloed op de geldigheid van de overige bepalingen van deze Servicevoorwaarden.

**11\. Annulerings-/herroepingsbeleid, uitsluiting van het recht op annulering**

11.1. Recht op annulering/herroeping

Je hebt het recht om je contract, zonder opgaaf van redenen, te annuleren binnen 14 dagen vanaf de datum waarop we je een e-mail met een bevestiging van je aankoop sturen.

Om je recht op annulering uit te voeren, moet je ons via een van de onderstaande contactmethoden op de hoogte stellen:

per post: The Meet Group, Inc., 100 Union Square Drive, New Hope, PA 18938, VS

per e-mail: [support@themeetgroup.com](mailto:support@themeetgroup.com)

Je moet ons ook een duidelijke schriftelijke verklaring verstrekken van je beslissing om je aankoop te annuleren. Je kunt het modelannuleringsformulier hieronder gebruiken, maar dit is niet verplicht. Als je dit formulier liever niet gebruikt, zorg dan dat je ons de informatie verstrekt die hieronder in Clausule 11.3 vermeld staat.

11.2. Gevolgen van annulering

Als je je contract binnen de annuleringsperiode van 14 dagen annuleert, betalen we je alle betalingen die we van je hebben ontvangen terug, zonder onnodige vertraging en in ieder geval niet later dan 14 dagen, geteld vanaf de dag waarop we werden geïnformeerd over je beslissing om te annuleren. We betalen deze terugbetaling met hetzelfde betaalmiddel dat je voor de oorspronkelijke transactie hebt gebruikt, tenzij je uitdrukkelijk met iets anders hebt ingestemd; en er worden voor deze terugbetaling geen kosten in rekening gebracht.

Maar als je binnen de annuleringsperiode van 14 dagen bent begonnen de gekochte goederen of diensten te gebruiken, dan hebben we het recht om een redelijk bedrag (waardecompensatie) van de terugbetaalde betaling in te houden voor dat gedeelte van de goederen of diensten dat je al hebt ontvangen.

11.3. Zorg dat je het aan je account gekoppelde e-mailadres of vergelijkbare aanmeldgegevens verstrekt.

11.4. Clausule 11.1 tot en met 11.3 zijn niet van toepassing op de annulering van Premium-lidmaatschappen die bij Apple zijn gekocht via de iOS-app of bij Google via de Android-app. Zie Clausule 2.4 voor meer informatie. Apple/ Google biedt mogelijk ook andere mechanismen waarmee je je abonnement kunt annuleren. Zie voor het annuleren van je Premium-lidmaatschap dat bij Apple via de iOS-app of bij Google via de Android-app is gekocht, hun instructies om op te zeggen. Deze vind je voor Apple [hier](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202039) en voor Google [hier](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2479637?hl=en-GB#apps).

**12\. Je wettelijke rechten**

Je hebt er recht op dat de Dienst is zoals beschreven, geschikt is voor het beoogde doel en van bevredigende kwaliteit is. Als je een Premium-lidmaatschap aanschaft en de Inhoud die we je leveren niet goed is, heb je recht op een reparatie of verbetering; of, als de fout niet kan worden verholpen of als deze niet binnen een redelijk tijdsbestek en zonder aanzienlijk ongemak kan worden verholpen, kun je recht hebben op een volledige of gedeeltelijke terugbetaling. Als je kunt aantonen dat de fout je toestel heeft beschadigd en wij geen redelijke zorg en vaardigheid hebben toegepast, heb je mogelijk recht op een reparatie of compensatie.

**13\. Diverse**

13.1. We kunnen gebruik maken van externe dienstverleners en vertegenwoordigers, inclusief entiteiten die tot onze groep behoren, om ons te helpen jou de Dienst te verlenen.

13.2. Mocht enige bepaling in de Abonnementsvoorwaarden ongeldig zijn of worden, of mochten deze incompleet zijn, dan is dit niet van invloed op de geldigheid van de rest van de inhoud van de Abonnementsvoorwaarden.

13.3. De taal van het contract en van de Abonnementsvoorwaarden is Nederlands.

13.4. We slaan niet automatisch een kopie van je Abonnementsvoorwaarden op. Daarom moet je een kopie op je computer opslaan of op andere wijze een kopie van je Abonnementsvoorwaarden opslaan op het moment dat je contract wordt afgesloten.

13.5. Je mag geen van je rechten of plichten onder de Abonnementsvoorwaarden overdragen of uitbesteden aan enige derde partij, tenzij wij hiermee schriftelijk akkoord gaan.

13.6. Wij kunnen al onze rechten of plichten onder de Abonnementsvoorwaarden naar eigen goeddunken toewijzen, overdragen of uitbesteden aan elke derde partij. Maar waar wij een derde partij hebben ingezet om een gedeelte van het contract met jou uit te voeren, blijven wij aansprakelijk jegens jou voor de volledige uitvoering van onze overeenkomst en ook voor de uitvoering door de derde partij.

13.7. Onze dochterondernemingen en groepsondernemingen zijn begunstigde derden van deze Servicevoorwaarden. Jij, TMG en onze dochterondernemingen en groepsondernemingen kunnen de Abonnementsvoorwaarden afdwingen in overeenstemming met de Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999. Behalve deze (maar behoudens Clausules 14 en 15 hieronder) heeft geen enkele andere persoon het recht onder de Contract (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 om de Abonnementsvoorwaarden af te dwingen.

Je kunt wedstrijdjes houden met andere leden om te zien wie de meeste huisdieren kan verzamelen en wiens profiel de meeste 'waarde' heeft.

16.2. Door naar de Pets-functie te gaan en deze voorwaarden te accepteren, begrijp je en ga je ermee akkoord deel te nemen aan het Pets-spel dat bij de Dienst hoort.

We kunnen een 'waarde' aangeven die aan elk huisdier gekoppeld is. Deze waarde is gebaseerd op door ons vastgestelde criteria, die het aantal 'verkopen' met betrekking tot het huisdier en de frequentie ervan kunnen omvatten. De waarde die aan elk huisdier wordt toegewezen, kan in de loop van de tijd fluctueren. Het bedrijf kan ranglijsten en andere gegevens publiceren die verwijzingen naar of berekeningen van de waarde van de huisdieren van leden bevatten. Door lid te worden, geef je onherroepelijk toestemming, autoriseer je en geef je een licentie aan ons en onze gelieerde ondernemingen, opvolgers en rechtverkrijgenden om je afbeelding, gelijkenis, uiterlijk, profielinformatie of persoonlijke kenmerken te gebruiken en anderen, waaronder andere leden, toestemming te geven deze te gebruiken in verband met de werking van het Pets-spel of andere activiteiten van de Dienst.

**1\. A Szolgáltatás leírása**

1.1. Miután fiókot regisztrált, hozzáférést biztosítunk egy online platformhoz, ahol megismerheti a többi regisztrált ügyfelet (más néven a tagokat). A Szolgáltatás csak mobilalkalmazásokon keresztül érhető el iOS és Android eszközökön (bár a jövőben más operációs rendszerek is elérhetőek lehetnek), illetve a Tagged és/vagy Hi5 weboldalunkon keresztül (kérjük, vegye figyelembe, hogy egyes funkciók csak a mobilalkalmazáson vagy az interneten keresztül érhetőek el); és a Szolgáltatás tartalmaz ingyenes és fizetős szolgáltatásokat is.

1.2. A Szolgáltatás tartalmazza a tagok „profilját”, amelyek az adott tagok által rendelkezésre bocsátott tartalmat (más néven „adatokat”) foglalnak magukban. További információkat találhat az [Adatvédelmi szabályzatunkban](https://secure.tagged.com/terms_of_service.html?#privacy_policy) arról, hogy milyen típusú személyes adatokat gyűjtünk, és hogy ezeket az adatokat miként tesszük hozzáférhetővé a többi tag számára (lásd az alábbi 5. pontot). Szolgáltatásunkat globálisan biztosítjuk; tagjaink számára lehetőség van arra, hogy bármely országban, ahol tevékenységünket végezzük, további tagokat keressenek meg és kapcsolatba lépjenek velük.

**2\. A szolgáltatáshoz való hozzáférés és az előfizetés lépései**

2.1. A Szolgáltatáshoz történő hozzáférésért és használatáért regisztrálnia kell. Ehhez ki kell választania az egyik rendelkezésre álló regisztrációs lehetőséget, mint például e-mail, SMS, Bejelentkezés Apple-lel, Bejelentkezés Google-lal vagy Facebookkal, és meg kell adnia a bejelentkezési adatokat, például az e-mail-címét és az Ön által választott jelszót. Jelszavának és fiókadatainak titokban tartásáért Ön felelős. Továbbá, Ön felelős minden olyan tevékenységért, amelyet hibásan okozott, amely az Ön fiókjában történik. Ön beleegyezik , hogy azonnal tájékoztat minket a fiókja jogosulatlan használatáról vagy a biztonság bármilyen más megsértéséről, amint arról tudomást szerez.

2.2. A sikeres regisztrációt követően hozzáférést kap ingyenes Szolgáltatásunkhoz („Alapszintű tagság”).

2.3. Különféle díjköteles szolgáltatásokat vagy funkciókat is kínálunk. Mielőtt ezen szolgáltatások vagy funkciók megvásárlására regisztrálna, további információkat adunk Önnek arról, hogy mit fog megvásárolni, például adott esetben: a szolgáltatások vagy funkciók főbb jellemzői, az előfizetés időtartama (beleértve az esetleges meghosszabbítást), az előfizetés megszüntetésének módja, az ár, valamint a fizetési feltételek és a fizetési módok feltételei. Amennyiben Ön virtuális termékeket vásárol (lásd az alábbi 3.3. pontot), tájékoztatjuk továbbá arról is, hogy ezek kizárólag a Szolgáltatásban válthatóak be digitális árucikkekre és tartalomra, és nem válthatók vissza. Ha Ön az Alapszintű tagságát díjköteles tagságra („Premium tagság”) kívánja frissíteni, vagy bármely más díjköteles szolgáltatáshoz vagy funkcióhoz kíván hozzáférni, tudomásul veszi, hogy a „Vásárlás most” gomb (vagy hasonló gomb) megnyomásakor megerősíti, hogy meg kívánja vásárolni a Premium tagságot vagy az Ön által kiválasztott egyéb szolgáltatásokat vagy funkciókat. Az ilyen vásárlásokra vonatkozó szerződéses viszonyunk azzal a dátummal kerül megerősítésre, amikor Ön megkapja a megrendelés visszaigazolását. Ugyanakkor felhívjuk figyelmét, hogy az Ön fizetési kötelezettségének teljesítése a vásárlást ellenőrző és feldolgozó adott fizetési szolgáltatótól függ.

2.4. Vásárolhat Apple iOS vagy a Google Android alkalmazásban is. Ez magában foglalja a Premium tagság vagy bármely más díjköteles szolgáltatás vagy funkció megvásárlását. Ebben az esetben továbbra is mi felelünk a Szolgáltatás nyújtásáért. Ön a vásárlást követően megrendelési visszaigazolást kap az előfizetési feltételekről. Azonban minden vásárlás és/vagy előfizetés kizárólag az Apple/Google-on keresztül köthető (és mondható le vagy szüntethető meg) (lásd 5.3. pont), és az Apple/Google által meghatározott technikai szabványok és elvek hatálya alá tartozik, amelyekre nincs ráhatásunk. Általános szabályként vásárlás egy alkalmazás-áruházon keresztül akkor valósul meg, amikor Ön a „Vásárlás most” gombra (vagy hasonló gombra kattint, és ha szükséges, megadja a jelszavát vagy az alkalmazás-áruházhoz tartozó egyenértékű hitelesítő adatokat (pl. Touch ID vagy Face ID)). Az Ön szerződéses kapcsolata az Apple-lel/Google-lel azon a napon kerül megállapításra, amikor az Apple/Google e-mailben visszaigazolást küld a megrendeléséről; és az Apple/Google az Apple/Google-fiókján keresztül kiállítja Önnek a Premium tagsággal kapcsolatos számlákat. Az alkalmazás-áruházban minden olyan lényeges információt megtalál, amire szüksége lesz az Apple-lel/ Google-lel létrejött szerződéses kapcsolatról. Ha Ön az alkalmazás-áruházon keresztül olyan Premium tagságot vásárol, amely automatikusan meghosszabbodik, a Prémium tagság határozott időtartamra szól, amely automatikusan meghosszabbodik, kivéve, ha Ön az Apple/Google szolgáltatási feltételeivel összhangban felmondja az előfizetését.Felhívjuk figyelmét, hogy a jelen Szolgáltatási feltételek 5.3. és 12. pontjai nem alkalmazandók, ha Ön az Apple-ön /Google-ön keresztül vásárolta meg a Premium tagságot.

2.5. Kérjük, tekintse meg az alábbi 14. és 15. pontot is azokról a feltételekről, amelyek akkor alkalmazandók, ha Ön az alkalmazásunkat az Apple-ről vagy a Google-ról töltötte le. Kérjük, ne feledje , hogy ha Ön az alkalmazásunkat az Apple/Google alkalmazás-áruházból töltötte le, akkor az Apple/Google alkalmazás-áruházának szolgáltatási feltételei érvényesek, és azok a jelen Szolgáltatási feltételekhez képest elsőbbséget élveznek bármilyen ellentmondás esetén.

**3\. Ingyenes és díjköteles szolgáltatások és vásárlások**

3.1. A Szolgáltatásra és az Alapszintű tagság használatára történő regisztráció ingyenes.

3.2. Ön választhatja a tagság Premium státuszra való frissítését („Premium tagság”) további havidíj ellenében. Ha úgy határoz, hogy Premium tagságot vásárol, a tagsága havonta automatikusan megújul.

3.3. Ön kizárólag a Szolgáltatásban történő használatra vásárolhat „virtuális termékeket” (pl. virtuális „aranyat”). A Virtuális áruk vásárlása vagy egyéb módon történő megszerzése csak egy korlátozott, nem átruházható, nem engedményezhető, teljes mértékben visszavonható licencet ad az ilyen Virtuális termékek használatára, hogy olyan szolgáltatásokhoz férjen hozzá, amelyeket kifejezetten az Ön személyes, nem kereskedelmi célú használatára bocsátunk rendelkezésre az ilyen Virtuális termékekkel (például élő animációk, úgynevezett Virtuális „Ajándékok”). A Virtuális termékek kizárólag a Szolgáltatásban válthatók be digitális árucikkekre és tartalmakra. A Virtuális termékeknek nincs lejárati ideje. A Virtuális termékek nem visszatéríthetőek. A Virtuális termékeknek nincs pénzértéke, és nem minősülnek sem pénznek, sem bármilyen tulajdonnak. A Virtuális termékeket nem lehet átruházni vagy engedményezni. Ön nem jogosult visszatérítésre, pénzre vagy bármilyen más kompenzációra a fel nem használt virtuális termékek után, ha a fiók a jelen Szolgáltatási feltételek súlyos megsértése miatt bezárásra kerül, vagy ha Ön úgy dönt, hogy bezárja a fiókját.

3.4. Ön virtuális áruk felhasználásával ajándékokat vásárolhat alkalmazásunk felhasználóinak, vagy más, az Ön számára látható alkalmazások felhasználóinak. Az egyes ajándékok ára a vásárlás helyén jelenik meg. Az ajándékok a Szolgáltatás egy bizonyos funkciójához való hozzáférésre vonatkozó korlátozott engedélyt képviselnek

3.5. Időről időre kínálhatunk bizonyos további szolgáltatásokat is, mint például vásárlási és e-kereskedelmi ajánlatokat és különféle információs szolgáltatásokat.

3.6. A Szolgáltatást módosíthatjuk azért, hogy: (i) a vonatkozó törvények és szabályozási követelmények változásait megjelenítsük; vagy (ii) kisebb technikai beállításokat és fejlesztéseket hajtsunk végre, például egy biztonsági fenyegetés orvoslása érdekében (ezek a módosítások azonban nem befolyásolják a Szolgáltatás Ön általi használatát). Továbbá, bár Szolgáltatásunkról leírást biztosítunk a weboldalunkon, időről időre megváltoztathatjuk Szolgáltatásunk főbb jellegzetességeit , anélkül, hogy ez Önre költségeket róna. Ugyanakkor ha így járunk el, akkor erről észszerű időn belül értesítjük Önt a változás hatályba lépése előtt; Ön ezután kapcsolatba léphet velünk, hogy megszüntesse előfizetését a változásról érkezett tájékoztatástól számított 30 napon belül , amennyiben a változás rontja a Szolgáltatásokhoz való hozzáférését vagy a Szolgáltatások használhatóságát, és ha a romlás nem csupán jelentéktelen a változások hatályba lépése előtt (és, abban az esetben, ha Ön Premium tagsággal fizetett elő rajtunk keresztül, Ön visszatérítésben részesül a szolgáltatásnak azon részére, amelyért ugyan fizetett , de nem vett igénybe az előfizetés korábbi megszűnése miatt). Minden ilyen értesítésben tájékoztatjuk Önt a változás természetéről és okairól, a változás hatálybalépésének időpontjáról, valamint azon jogáról, miszerint az előfizetést az értesítéstől számított 30 napon belül a jelen 3.6. pontnak megfelelően felmondhatja.

**4\. Az adatok felhasználása**

4.1. További információkat olvashat arról, hogy miként használjuk vagy kezeljük az Ön személyes adatait, és milyen kötelezettségeink vannak az adatvédelemmel kapcsolatban az [Adatvédelmi szabályzatunkban](https://secure.tagged.com/terms_of_service.html?#privacy_policy).

4.2. Folyamatosan törekszünk arra, hogy megvédjük Önt az olyan zaklatásoktól, mint a hackertámadások, a spam vagy a romantikus szélhámosság. Ebből a célból számos technikai és szervezeti előírást dolgoztunk ki. Az Ön felelőssége az, hogy betartsa az alábbi 8. pontban megfogalmazott felhasználói előírásokat. Előfordulhat, hogy a „Bizalmi és biztonsági csapatunk” kapcsolatba lép Önnel adott esetben, az ilyen természetű problémák megoldása érdekében. Ebben az esetben részletesen ismertetjük a kapcsolatfelvétel okát, Önnek pedig kötelessége, hogy együttműködjön és válaszoljon a megkereséstől számított észszerű időn belül. Ha intézkedéseket javasolunk, komolyan fontolóra kell azokat vennie. Ha Ön elutasít egy javasolt intézkedést, kötelessége erről észszerű időn belül tájékoztatni minket, és megnevezni az általunk javasolt intézkedés elutasításának okait. A problémás tartalmat vagy viselkedést a bejelentés funkció útján is jelentenie kell felénk.

4.3. Automatikusan törölhetjük azokat a válasz nélküli üzeneteket, amelyeket olyan profilok vagy a profiloknak küldtek, és amelyeket spamként vagy romantikus csalásként azonosítottunk, vagy amelyek más módon törlésre kerültek.

**5\. Megszüntetés/hosszabbítás**

**Kérjük, olvassa el a 11. szakaszt, amennyiben a Premium tagságot a 14 napos felmondási/„gondolkodási” időszakon belül szeretné lemondani (az Ön felmondási joga).**

5.1. Az Alapszintű tagságot bármikor azonnali hatállyal felmondhatja a fiókbeállítások alatt, vagy ha kapcsolatba lép velünk ([support@themeetgroup.com](mailto:support@themeetgroup.com)).

5.2. Ha az Alapszintű tagságának aktív virtuális termékekkel rendelkezik, akkor a felmondásról értesítenie kell bennünket a [support@themeetgroup.com](mailto:support@themeetgroup.com) címen. Ügyeljen arra , hogy megadja a fiókjához kapcsolódó e-mail címet vagy hasonló hitelesítő adatokat, hogy be tudjuk Önt azonosítani.

5.3. Ha szeretné megszüntetni a Premium tagságát, azt bármikor megteheti, amikor az Önnek megfelel. Ha a Premium tagsági fiókját a weboldalunkon keresztül számlázzuk, akkor keresse fel a [http://www.tagged.com/account\_info.html](http://www.tagged.com/account_info.html) oldalt, kattintson az Előfizetések és Fizetések fülre, válassza az „Előfizetés törlése” lehetőséget, majd kattintson a „Prémium tagság törlése” gombra legalább három nappal a következő esedékes automatikus fizetés előtt, hogy megfelelően fel tudjuk dolgozni a törlési kérelmet. Ha nem így jár el, a tagságot így is lemondhatja az adott előfizetési időszak végéig, azonban a következő időszakra vonatkozóan még bevételezhetjük az összeget, amelyet aztán visszatérítünk Önnek. Ez nem érinti az Ön arra vonatkozó jogát, hogy egyéb okokból megszüntesse Premium tagságát. Ebben az esetben meg kell neveznie a rendkívüli felmondás indokait, ha ezen az alapon mondja fel az előfizetést. Ha a Premium tagsági fiókját az Apple-ön keresztül számlázzák, akkor a következő tervezett automatikus fizetés előtt legalább 24 órával le kell mondania az előfizetést, követve az [itt](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039) leírt folyamatot. Ha a Premium tagsági fiókját a Google-ön keresztül számlázzák, akkor a számlázási ciklus kezdetétől számított hét napon belül le kell mondania az előfizetést, követve az [itt](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid) leírt folyamatot. Akár írhat is nekünk az alábbi 16. pontban megadott elérhetőségeken. Az 5.5. és az alábbi 11. pontra tekintettel, az Ön előfizetésének megszüntetése csak az aktuális számlázási időszak végéig lép hatályba (és mint ilyen, Ön nem jogosult visszatérítésre). Így annak érdekében, hogy a Premium tagsága ne hosszabbodjon meg automatikusan, tájékoztatnia kell minket arról, hogy az aktuális előfizetési időszak lejárta előtt meg kívánja szüntetni az előfizetését.

5.4. Amennyiben törli az Alapszintű vagy Premium tagságát, a korábban vásárolt virtuális termékek szintén törlődnek, és a fizetős szolgáltatások vagy funkciók (például a virtuális termékek) megvásárlásából fennálló fizetési kötelezettségek továbbra is érvényben maradnak, az alkalmazandó lemondási jogok függvényében (lásd a 12. pontot).

5.5. Személyazonosságának és a felmondási kérelmének hitelesítéséhez meg kell adnia a fiókjához kapcsolódó e-mail-címet vagy más személyes adatokat, hogy be tudjuk Önt azonosítani.

5.6. Ha úgy dönt, hogy Premium tagságot vásárol, a tagsága havonta automatikusan meghosszabbodik, kivéve, ha a jelen szakasznak megfelelően lemondja az előfizetést.

5.7. A Premium tagság megszüntetésével a fiók visszaáll az Alapszintű tagságra. Ha meg kívánja szüntetni az Alapszintű tagságát, kérjük, kövesse az 5.1. pontban meghatározott folyamatot.

5.8. Az 5.4. pontra is tekintettel és a 3.6. pontnak megfelelően, amennyiben Ön azért kívánja megszüntetni a Premium tagságát, mert közöltük Önnel, hogy a Szolgáltatásunkban lényeges változás következik be, az előfizetése azonnal megszűnik, miután megkaptuk a felmondási nyilatkozatát szöveges formában (például e-mailben vagy faxon), és visszatérítjük Önnek a Premium tagság azon hányadát , amelyet nem szolgáltattunk. Ha a Premium tagságot Apple/Google-ön keresztül vásárolta, a lemondás és a visszatérítés az Apple/Google saját feltételei szerint kerül végrehajtásra a 2.4. és 5.3. pontban leírtak szerint.

**6\. 6. A működőképesség, kompatibilitás, átjárhatóság, garanciák és felelősség**

6.1. Kérjük, tartsa szem előtt, hogy bár minden tőlünk telhetőt megteszünk, nem tudjuk azt garantálni, hogy a Szolgáltatás az idő 100%-ában elérhető lesz. Előfordulhat, hogy a Szolgáltatásunk elérhetősége csökken karbantartás és szoftverfrissítés miatt, valamint olyan időszakok alkalmával, amikor a Szolgáltatás nem elérhető olyan technikai vagy egyéb problémák miatt, amelyek nem állnak az irányításunk alatt.

6.2. Egyes funkciók csak a weboldalon vagy az alkalmazásban érhetőek el. A mobilalkalmazáson keresztül nem lehetséges többek között bizonyos funkciók, például a Tags, a Luv és a Webprofil testreszabása, elérése vagy használata). Az Élő funkció csak a mobilalkalmazáson keresztül érhető el és használható.

6.3. Habár Szolgáltatásainkat a mobil weboldalakon keresztül ingyenesen nyújtjuk, az Ön mobilszolgáltatójának szokásos díjai és tarifái továbbra is alkalmazandók. Ön elfogadja a díjak vonatkozásában a felelősséget.

6.4. Ahhoz, hogy a Szolgáltatást teljes körűen tudja használni, a mobileszközén vagy számítógépén a legfrissebb (böngésző) technológiákat kell használnia (pl. engedélyezni kell a Java scriptet, a cookie-kat, a felugró ablakokat). Ha régebbi operációs rendszert vagy internetszolgáltatót használ, a Szolgáltatásokat korlátozott mértékben tudja csak használni. Az alkalmazás használatakor a mobileszköz, az operációs rendszer vagy a kiválasztott beállítások korlátozhatják az alkalmazás bizonyos funkcióit (pl. push-üzenetek, távolságkeresés).

6.5. Ha termékfrissítéseket kínálunk, beleértve az Android- és iOS-alkalmazásaink frissítését, kifejezetten javasoljuk, hogy azokat a lehető leghamarabb telepítse. Az Ön felelőssége, hogy ezeket a frissítéseket észszerű időn belül feltelepítse. Ha nem így jár el annak ellenére, hogy tájékoztattuk Önt a frissítés elérhetőségéről, illetve a következményekről, melyek a frissítés telepítésének elmulasztásával járnak, akkor nem vállalunk felelősséget a termék azon hibáiért, amelyek a frissítés telepítésének elmulasztásából erednek; ez nem vonatkozik arra a tényre, hogy Ön nem vagy nem megfelelően telepítette a frissítést az Ön általunk megadott helytelen telepítési utasítások miatt.

6.6. A regisztráció során megadott információk pontosságáért Ön felel. Ha frissítenie kell a profilját vagy a regisztrációs adatait, ezt általánosságban bármikor megteheti a profilján keresztül. Vannak azonban olyan információk, amelyeket csak úgy frissíthet, ha a 16. pontban megadott elérhetőségeken kapcsolatba lép velünk. Azt egyértelműen jelezni fogjuk Önnek, ha kapcsolatba kell lépnie velünk bizonyos információk frissítése érdekében.

6.7. Mi csak a Szolgáltatás technikai nyújtásáért vagyunk felelősek (a 3. pontban leírtak szerint). Általánosságban lehetővé tesszük, hogy más tagokkal kapcsolatba léphessen. Azt azonban nem tudjuk garantálni, hogy a Szolgáltatás használatával Ön partnerre talál.

6.8. Bár számítunk arra, hogy tagjaink kedvesen és tisztelettudóan (és a jelen Szolgáltatási feltételeknek megfelelően) használják a Szolgáltatást, nem vagyunk felelősek a Szolgáltatásban elérhetővé tett személyes adatokkal való visszaélésért; a Szolgáltatásnak a tagok által történő bármely más, a jelen Szolgáltatási feltételekkel ellentétes használatáért; vagy bármely más módon történő jogosulatlan vagy jogellenes használatért. Nem tartozunk felelősséggel az adatokkal vagy információkkal való visszaélésekért sem a tagok, sem a nem tagok, sem harmadik felek részéről, amennyiben Ön szolgáltatta az információt a harmadik félnek. Mindazonáltal, amint tudomást szerzünk a Szolgáltatásainkon keresztül a Tartalommal kapcsolatos (a 9.2. pontban meghatározottak szerinti) ilyen visszaéléséről vagy jogellenességéről, megtesszük a szükséges óvintézkedéseket annak érdekében, hogy megakadályozzuk a jövőbeni visszaéléseket és a jelen Szolgáltatási feltételek és a vonatkozó jogszabályok más megsértését.

6.9. Bár keményen dolgozunk a magas színvonalú szolgáltatás biztosítása érdekében, nem garantáljuk, hogy a Szolgáltatás mindig tökéletesen fog működni, és nem tudjuk biztosítani, hogy a Szolgáltatás mindenkor zavartalan, biztonságos vagy hibamentes legyen. Különösen nem vagyunk felelősek az olyan fennakadásokért, amelyek befolyásolják a Szolgáltatás hozzáférhetőségét, amennyiben az ilyen fennakadásokat olyan tevékenységek vagy események okozzák, amelyek kívül esnek az irányításunkon. Továbbá, bár megfelelő technikai és szervezeti biztonsági intézkedéseket teszünk az Ön személyes adatainak védelme céljából, a jogszabályok által megengedett legteljesebb mértékben nem vállalunk felelősséget az Ön személyes adataihoz harmadik fél által történő jogosulatlan hozzáférésért (pl. hackerek adatbázisunkhoz való illetéktelen hozzáférése miatt), ha ez nem a részünkre felróható cselekmény vagy mulasztás, különösen ha az alkalmazandó jogszabályok megsértésének megelőzése érdekében szükséges óvintézkedések elmulasztása miatt következik be.

6.10. A Szolgáltatások használatából eredő károkért a jogszabályi rendelkezések hatályán belül, a jogalapra való tekintet nélkül, kizárólag a következő rendelkezések szerint felelünk:

a) Korlátozás nélkül felelünk a halál vagy személyi sérülés miatt bekövetkezett károkért, a szándékos vagy súlyos gondatlanságunk, törvényes képviselőink vagy megbízottjaink által okozott károkért, továbbá az általunk vállalt garancia be nem tartása vagy tudatosan elhallgatott hibák miatt bekövetkezett károkért.

b) Minden egyéb, a lényeges szerződéses kötelezettségek megszegéséből származó, általunk, törvényes képviselőink vagy megbízottjaink által elkövetett egyszerű gondatlanságból eredő kár esetén a felelősségünk az ügy jellege alapján áll fenn. A lényeges szerződéses kötelezettségek (sarkalatos kötelezettségek) olyan kötelezettségek, amelyek teljesítése lehetővé teszi a szerződés megfelelő teljesítését, és amelyek teljesítésére a szerződő fél rendes körülmények között számíthat. Ilyen esetekben a szerződésben az előre látható károkért a szokásos kártérítési összeggel felelünk. A felelősség egyebekben kizárt.

c) A német termékfelelősségi törvény szerinti felelősséget a fenti rendelkezések nem érintik.

6.11. Ön köteles megfelelő intézkedéseket tenni a károk megelőzése és enyhítése végett, különösen az Ön eszközein lévő adatok megfelelő biztonságának garantálása érdekében, amennyire ez technikailag lehetséges. Az adatok sérüléséért vagy adatvesztésért a felelősség csak arra a szokásos helyreállítási műveletre korlátozódik, amelyre akkor lett volna szükség, ha rendszeresen és a kockázat mértékének megfelelően biztonsági másolatok készülnek megfelelő vírusvédelmet alkalmaznak.

**7\. Az Ügyfél felelőssége és kötelezettségei**

7.1. Ha Premium tagságot és/vagy egyéb díjköteles szolgáltatásokat vagy funkciókat vásárol, vállalja, hogy az Előfizetési feltételekben meghatározott valamennyi díjat megfizeti (és adott esetben bármely további feltételben, pl. az Apple/Google alkalmazás-áruház feltételeiben). Továbbá nem tudunk Önnek Szolgáltatást biztosítani amíg a fizetés meg nem történik, és a törvény által megengedett módon lépéseket tehetünk a kintlévőségek behajtása érdekében. Önt terheli továbbá (és mi felszámítjuk Önnek) minden olyan visszaterhelési díj (például a fizetési szolgáltatóinktól) vagy minden egyéb észszerű díj, amelyet a megállapodás szerinti díjak Ön általi meg nem fizetése miatt vetnek ki ránk.

7.2. Mint fentebb említettük, Ön felelős a regisztráció során megadott tartalmak pontosságáért és minden olyan információért, amelyet a profiljában önmagáról megad. Azzal, hogy megadja nekünk ezeket az információkat, Ön elfogadja és kijelenti, hogy azok a valóságnak megfelelnek és pontosak. Lépéseket teszünk annak biztosítására is, hogy az Ön adatai pontosak és naprakészek maradjanak. Az Ön személyazonosságának szándékos és/vagy csalárd meghamisítása, beleértve egy másik vagy fiktív személyazonosság használatát is, esetleges jogi felelősségvonással járhat.

7.3. Ön vállalja, hogy nem használja fel az általunk és/vagy a Szolgáltatásaink használata során rendelkezésére bocsátott tartalmakat – beleértve a harmadik felekre (beleértve más tagokat is) vonatkozó információkat –kereskedelmi vagy reklámcélokra. Ön különösen nem alkalmazhat olyan technológiai módszereket vagy eljárásokat, amelyekkel automatikusan letölthet vagy más módon hozzáférhet más tagokra vonatkozó információkhoz , annak érdekében, hogy ezeket az információkat a Szolgáltatáson kívül használja fel (pl. számítógépes programmal vagy a tartalom másolásával és beillesztésével). Ön elfogadja továbbá, hogy számítógépes programok használata a tagok adatait tartalmazó fájlok automatikus olvasása céljából (mint például crawlerek) tilos.

7.4. Ha Ön lényegesen megszegi a jelen Szolgáltatási feltételeket, vagy más módon megszegi a törvényt a Szolgáltatásunk használatával összefüggésben, jogosultak lehetünk kártérítési igény érvényesítésére a vonatkozó jogszabályok szerint.

7.5. Ön bizalmasan kezeli a Szolgáltatáson keresztül vagy azzal kapcsolatban kapott e-maileket és egyéb üzeneteket, és nem adja át ezen üzeneteket harmadik félnek a feladó beleegyezése vagy komoly ok hiányában. Ugyanezek a szabályok vonatkoznak a többi tag nevére, telefon- és faxszámára, otthoni címére, e-mail-címére és/vagy URL-címére, illetve egyéb személyes adataira is.

7.6. Ön elfogadja, hogy a kapott üzeneteket (valamint a profiljában szereplő minden olyan információt, amelyet meg szeretne őrizni) rendszeres és megfelelő időközönként lekérdezi, és szükség esetén ezeket az információkat saját számítógépén vagy más adattároló rendszerében archiválja. Ön tudomásul veszi, hogy a fiókjában tárolt üzeneteket az üzenet beérkezésétől számított tizenkét hónap elteltével törölhetjük, anélkül, hogy külön értesítést küldenénk Önnek. Ha Ön Alapszintű tag, tudomásul veszi, hogy a jelenlegi Alapszintű tagságával kapcsolatos összes adatát automatikusan töröljük, ha a profilja huszonnégy hónapig inaktív.

7.7. Minden felhasználó köteles betartani a [Tartalomra és magatartásra vonatkozó szabályzatot](https://terms.tagged.com/content-and-conduct). Emellett tilos:

* megkísérelni jogosulatlanul hozzáférni az adatbázisunkhoz vagy más számítógépes rendszerekhez;
    
* az általunk a Szolgáltatással kapcsolatban használt bármely szoftverprogramot megváltoztatni, lefordítani, adaptálni, szerkeszteni, szétbontani vagy visszafejteni;
    
* bármilyen olyan tevékenységet folytatni, amely megzavarja, csökkenti a Szolgáltatás minőségét, zavarja a teljesítményét, vagy károsítja a Szolgáltatás működését;
    
* egy másik tag fiókját, felhasználónevét vagy jelszavát használni bármikor , vagy a jelszavát harmadik félnek felfedni, vagy harmadik félnek engedélyezni, hogy hozzáférjen a fiókjához;
    
* megkísérelni Virtuális termékek vásárlását a Szolgáltatáson kívül;
    
* megkísérelni Virtuális termékek értékesítését; és/vagy
    

7.8. megkísérelni az egyik Szolgáltatáshoz társított felhasználói fiók eladását. Ha Ön nem felel meg a jelen 7. pontban ismertetett magatartási előírásoknak, vagy ha Ön nem teljesíti az Előfizetési feltételek valamely lényeges kötelezettségét, akkor - amennyiben az adott eset körülményei alapján ésszerű - az alábbi intézkedéseket vagy azok mindegyikét megtehetjük: felszólíthatjuk Önt, hogy hagyjon fel a nem megfelelő tevékenységeivel (vagy más módon küldhetünk Önnek figyelmeztetést, hogy tevékenységei nem felelnek meg a magatartási előírásainknak); törölhetünk minden olyan tartalmat, amelyet Ön a Szolgáltatáson keresztül a magatartási előírásaink bármelyikét megszegve küldött be; felfüggeszthetjük a Szolgáltatás nyújtását az Ön számára (részben vagy egészben), amíg a probléma megoldódik (például amíg kivizsgáljuk az Ön tevékenységét); vagy (ha számunkra egyértelmű, hogy Ön komolyan visszaél a Szolgáltatással) megszüntethetjük a Szolgáltatás Ön számára történő nyújtását. Ha a Premium tagságot az Apple/Google-ön keresztül vásárolta, a visszatérítés az Apple/Google saját feltételei szerint kerül végrehajtásra a 2.4. pontban leírtak szerint.

**8\. Kommunikáció**

8.1. A felületünkön történő kommunikációnak mindig a jelen Szolgáltatási feltételekkel összhangban kell történnie, különösen a Szolgáltatás használatának biztonságra vonatkozó feltételekkel (lásd a 4. pontot) és a [Tartalmi és viselkedési szabályzattal](https://terms.tagged.com/content-and-conduct).

8.2. A Szolgáltatás online szolgáltatás. Ezért általában online kommunikálunk Önnel, például e-mailben vagy a mobilalkalmazásainkon és weboldalunkon található információs képernyőkön keresztül. Mivel digitális szolgáltatásról van szó, a Szolgáltatásunkat kizárólag online nyújtjuk. Ezért a Szolgáltatásunkra csak online regisztrálhat, online használhatja és online fizethet rá elő.

8.3. Annak érdekében, hogy ne kapjunk jogosulatlan megkereséseket (és hogy megvédjük fiókját a visszaélésektől), kérjük, adja meg a fiókjához kapcsolódó e-mail -címét vagy hasonló hitelesítő adatokat, hogy be tudjuk Önt azonosítani.

**9\. Felhasználási és szerzői jogok**

9.1. A Szolgáltatásunk használatával Ön tudomásul veszi és elfogadja, hogy mi vagyunk a Szolgáltatással kapcsolatos valamennyi jog kizárólagos tulajdonosai, beleértve a sokszorosítási, terjesztési és feldolgozási jogokat, minden szerzői jogot, valamint a Tagged és/vagy a Hi5 weboldal és a benne foglalt tartalom szellemi átadásának és sokszorosításának jogát. A Szolgáltatásban található programok, tartalmak, anyagok, védjegyek és kereskedelmi nevek használata kizárólag a jelen Szolgáltatási feltételekben foglalt célokra engedélyezett.

9.2. A Szolgáltatásunk használatával Ön tudomásul veszi és elfogadja, hogy az Ön által közzétett Tartalom (amely alatt minden adat, szöveg, szoftver, zene, hang, fénykép, fotó, grafika, műalkotás, videó, kép, fotó, bejegyzés, videóadás, üzenet vagy bármilyen más anyag értendő, akár nyilvánosan közzétett, akár magánjellegű ) az Ön kizárólagos felelőssége. Ön tudatában van annak, hogy a Tartalom nyilvánosan elérhetővé tétele révén azt más felhasználók is láthatják, és hogy más tagok visszaélhetnek vele, azaz a Tartalmát más célokra is felhasználhatják, mint amire Ön azt hozzáférhetővé tette. Ön biztosítja és garantálja, hogy Ön rendelkezik vagy birtokolja a szükséges licenceket, jogokat, hozzájárulásokat és engedélyeket az összes Tartalom közzétételéhez. Rendelkezünk olyan mechanizmusokkal, amelyekkel rendszeresen ellenőrizzük a jelen Szolgáltatási Feltételeknek és a vonatkozó jogszabályoknak való megfelelést, mindenekelőtt az Ön adataival való visszaélés megakadályozása érdekében, azonban nem tudjuk és nem is fogjuk teljes mértékben ellenőrizni a közzétett Tartalmat, és mint ilyen, nem ellenőrizzük annak pontosságát, épségét, minőségét vagy bármely más szempontot. Semmilyen körülmények között nem vállalunk felelősséget semmiféle Tartalomért, beleértve, de nem kizárólagosan a Tartalomban található hibákat vagy hiányosságokat, vagy bármilyen veszteségért vagy kárért, amely a Tartalom felhasználásából ered.

9.3. Ön ezennel felhatalmazza a Vállalatot arra, hogy az ilyen Tartalmakat (beleértve az Ön felhasználónevét és képmását) a Szolgáltatásokban felhasználja, terjessze, reprodukálja, rögzítse, módosítsa, adaptálja, feldolgozza, kombinálja, szinkronizálja, származékos műveket hozzon létre, közzétegye, nyilvánosan előadja és nyilvánosan megjelenítse, kizárólag azért, hogy az Ön számára a jelen Feltételeknek megfelelően Szolgáltatásainkat nyújthassuk.

9.4. Ez az engedély felhatalmazza a Vállalatot, hogy az Ön Tartalmát a világ többi része számára is elérhetővé tegye, és hogy mások is ugyanezt megtehessék. Ön tudomásul veszi, hogy ez az engedély tartalmazza a Vállalat azon jogát, hogy a Szolgáltatásokat nyújtsa, népszerűsítse, fejlessze, valamint hogy a Szolgáltatásokhoz vagy a Szolgáltatásokon keresztül benyújtott Tartalmat más vállalatok, szervezetek vagy magánszemélyek számára elérhetővé tegye az ilyen Tartalom más médiumokon és szolgáltatásokon történő közvetítése, sugárzása, terjesztése, népszerűsítése vagy közzététele céljából, a Vállalat ilyen tartalomhasználatra vonatkozó Szolgáltatási feltételeinek megfelelően. Az ilyen, a Vállalat, vagy más vállalatok, szervezetek vagy magánszemélyek általi felhasználás történhet anélkül, hogy az Ön által beküldött, közzétett, továbbított vagy más módon a Szolgáltatásokon keresztül elérhetővé tett Tartalmakért Önt kompenzáció illetné.

9.5. A Vállalat felhasználhatja az Ön visszajelzéseit, észrevételeit és javaslatait anélkül, hogy bármilyen kompenzációs kötelezettség terhelné. A Vállalat továbbra is használhatja és elérhetővé tehet bármilyen és minden Tartalmat, és a Vállalat a későbbiekben is rendelkezik ezekkel a jogokkal, még akkor is, ha az Ön fiókja megszűnik.

9.6. Ön tudomásul veszi és elfogadja, hogy a Vállalat nem ígéri meg a Szolgáltatásban elérhetővé tett Tartalom rendszeres ellenőrzését. Ön tudomásul veszi, hogy megtagadhatjuk az Ön által a Szolgáltatásban elérhetővé tett információ vagy Tartalom közzétételét, vagy eltávolíthatjuk azt, ha a Tartalom sérti a jelen Szolgáltatási feltételeket vagy bármely más alkalmazandó jogszabályt. Például eltávolíthatunk bármilyen olyan Tartalmat, amely sérti a jelen Szolgáltatási feltételeket, vagy más módon kifogásolható. Ön vállalja a Tartalom használatával kapcsolatos felelősséget, beleértve, de nem kizárólagosan az ilyen Tartalom pontosságára, teljességére vagy hasznosságára való támaszkodást. Ön nem sokszorosíthat, nem publikálhat, nem terjeszthet tovább, és nem mutathat be nyilvánosan olyan Tartalmat a Szolgáltatásokban, amely nem az Ön tulajdona.

**10\. Irányadó jog / Fogyasztóvédelmi jogviták bíróságon kívüli rendezése**

10.1. A jelen Szolgáltatási feltételekre az Egyesült Államok Kalifornia államának törvényei az irányadók, és azok szerint értelmezendők, tekintet nélkül a kollíziós jogi elvekre. Ez a jogválasztás azonban nem alkalmazható, ha ennek eredményeképpen megfosztja Önt attól a védelemtől, amelyet olyan rendelkezések nyújtanak Önnek, amelyektől megállapodással nem lehet eltérni azon jog alapján, amely a jogválasztás hiányában a törvényi rendelkezések alapján alkalmazandó lett volna.

10.2. A hatályos jogszabályok értelmében kötelesek vagyunk tájékoztatni a fogyasztókat az Európai Online Vitarendezési Platform létezéséről, amelyet az Európai Bizottság hozott létre vitarendezés céljából. Az Európai Online Vitarendezési Platform itt található: [https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/). A hivatalos vitarendezési testületek elérhetőségei a következő hivatkozáson találhatók: [https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/odr/main/index.cfm](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/odr/main/index.cfm). Jogszabályi kötelezettség hiányában nem vagyunk kötelesek részt venni vitarendezési eljárásban fogyasztói vitarendezési szerv előtt, és nem vagyunk kötelesek és nem kívánunk részt venni ilyen vitarendezési eljárásban. E-mail -címünk a 16. pontban található.

10.3. Ha a jelen Szolgáltatási feltételek bármely rendelkezése teljes egészében vagy részben érvénytelen vagy végrehajthatatlanná válik, az nem érinti jelen Szolgáltatási feltételek fennmaradó rendelkezéseinek érvényességét.

**11\. Lemondásra/elállásra vonatkozó szabályok, a felmondási jog gyakorlása**

11.1. A lemondás/elállás joga

Önnek joga van indoklás nélkül felmondani a szerződést attól a dátumtól számított 14 napon belül, amikor e-mailben megküldtük Önnek a visszaigazolást a vásárlásról.

A lemondáshoz való jogának gyakorlásához Önnek értesítenie kell minket az alábbiakban megadott elérhetőségek bármelyikén:

postai úton: The Meet Group, Inc., 100 Union Square Drive, New Hope, PA 18938, USA

e-mailben: [support@themeetgroup.com](mailto:support@themeetgroup.com)

Egyértelmű írásbeli nyilatkozatot kell adnia nekünk a vásárlás lemondásáról szóló döntéséről. Használhatja az alább elérhető lemondási űrlapot , ez azonban nem kötelező. Ha nem szeretné ezt az űrlapot használni, kérjük, győződjön meg arról, hogy a 11.3. pontban felsorolt információkat átadja részünkre.

11.2. A lemondás hatása

Ha Ön a 14 napos felmondási időn belül felmondja a szerződését, visszautaljuk az Öntől érkezett összes befizetést indokolatlan késedelem nélkül, de minden esetben legkésőbb attól a naptól számított 14 napon belül, amikor bennünket értesített a felmondásra vonatkozó döntéséről. A visszatérítést ugyanazzal a fizetési móddal hajtjuk végre, mint amelyet az eredeti tranzakció során használt, kivéve, ha Ön kifejezetten másképp nem rendelkezik; az ilyen visszatérítés során semmilyen esetben sem merül fel az Ön számára semmilyen díj.

Mindazonáltal kérjük, vegye figyelembe, hogy ha a 14 napos elállási időszakon belül megkezdte a megvásárolt áru vagy szolgáltatás használatát, akkor jogosultak leszünk a visszatérített összegből egy észszerű összeget visszatartani (értékkompenzáció) az áru vagy szolgáltatás azon részéért, amelyet Ön már igénybe vett.

11.3. Ügyeljen arra, hogy megadja a fiókjához kapcsolódó e-mail-címet vagy hasonló hitelesítő adatokat.

11.4. A 11.1-11.3. pontok nem vonatkoznak az Apple-től az iOS alkalmazáson keresztül vagy a Google-tól az Android alkalmazáson keresztül vásárolt Premium tagság törlésére. További információkért lásd a 2.4. pontot. Az Apple/ Google további mechanizmusokat is biztosíthat az előfizetés törlésére. Az Apple-nél az iOS alkalmazáson keresztül vagy a Google-nél az Android alkalmazáson keresztül vásárolt Premium tagság megszüntetéséhez lásd a lemondásra vonatkozó utasításokat az Apple esetében [itt](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202039) és a Google esetében [itt](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2479637?hl=en-GB#apps).

**12\. Az Ön törvényes jogai**

Önnek joga van ahhoz, hogy a Szolgáltatás a leírásnak megfelelő, a célnak megfelelő és megbízható minőségben álljon rendelkezésre. Ha Premium tagságot vásárol, és az általunk biztosított tartalom hibás, Ön javításra vagy cserére jogosult; vagy ha a hiba nem javítható, vagy nem javítható észszerű időn belül és jelentős kényelmetlenség nélkül, akkor teljes vagy részleges visszatérítésre lehet jogosult. Ha be tudja bizonyítani, hogy a hiba kárt okozott a készülékében, és mi nem az elvárható gondossággal és szakértelemmel jártunk el, javításra vagy kártérítésre lehet jogosult.

**13\. Vegyes rendelkezések**

13.1. Harmadik fél szolgáltatókat és ügynököket vehetünk igénybe, beleértve a csoportunkhoz tartozó szervezeteket is, hogy segítségünkre legyenek a Szolgáltatás nyújtásában.

13.2. Amennyiben az Előfizetés feltételeinek bármely rendelkezése érvénytelen vagy érvénytelenné válik, illetve hiányos, az nem érinti az Előfizetési feltételek fennmaradó tartalmának érvényességét.

13.3. A szerződés nyelve és az Előfizetési feltételek nyelve az angol.

13.4. Az Ön előfizetési feltételeinek a másolatát nem őrizzük meg automatikusan. Éppen ezért mentse el a szerződés egy példányát a számítógépére, vagy más módon tároljon el egy példányt az Előfizetési feltételekből a szerződés megkötésének időpontjában.

13.5. Ön nem ruházhatja át vagy adhatja tovább az Előfizetési feltételekben foglalt jogait vagy kötelezettségeit harmadik félnek, kivéve, ha abba írásban beleegyezünk.

13.6. Az Előfizetési feltételek szerinti jogainkat vagy kötelezettségeinket engedményezhetjük, átruházhatjuk vagy alvállalkozásba adhatjuk belátásunk szerint bármely harmadik félnek. Ha azonban harmadik felet bíztunk meg az Önnel kötött szerződés teljesítésével, továbbra is felelősséggel tartozunk Önnel szemben a szerződésünk teljes körű teljesítéséért, valamint a harmadik fél általi teljesítéséért.

13.7. A leányvállalataink és a csoport vállalatai a jelen Szolgáltatási feltételek harmadik fél kedvezményezettjei. Ön, a TMG és más leányvállalataink és a csoport vállalatai az 1999. évi szerződésekről („Harmadik felek jogai”) szóló törvénynek megfelelően érvényesíthetik a jelen Előfizetési feltételeket. Ettől eltekintve, (de az alábbi 14. és 15. pontra is figyelemmel) az 1999. évi szerződésekről szóló („Harmadik felek jogai”) törvény értelmében senki másnak nincs joga az Előfizetési feltételek érvényesítésére.

**14\. További feltételek, amelyek akkor alkalmazandók, ha Ön letöltötte alkalmazásunkat az Apple App Store-ból**

14.1. Ez a szakasz további feltételeket tartalmaz, amelyek akkor vonatkoznak Önre, ha az alkalmazást az Apple App Store áruházból töltötte le.

14.2. Ami a köztünk és az Apple közötti kapcsolat vonatkozásában a felelősség az alkalmazásunkért a következőképpen oszlik meg:

* Ezek a Szolgáltatási feltételek Ön és mi közöttünk állnak fenn. A jelen Szolgáltatási feltételek nem Ön és az Apple között állnak fenn.
    
* Alkalmazásunkért és annak tartalmáért kizárólag mi vagyunk felelősek, nem pedig az Apple. Az Ön felé fennálló felelősségeinket és kötelezettségeinket a jelen Szolgáltatási feltételek egyéb szakaszai ismertetik.
    
* Az Apple nem köteles semmilyen karbantartási vagy támogatási szolgáltatást nyújtani alkalmazásunkhoz.
    
* Nem az Apple, hanem mi tartozunk felelősséggel az alkalmazásunkhoz kapcsolódó termékgaranciákért.
    
* Ha alkalmazásunk nem felel meg az alkalmazandó garanciának, Ön értesítheti az Apple-t, és - ha a vásárlást Ön eszközölte - az Apple visszatéríti Önnek a vételárat. Az Apple-nek nem áll fenn egyéb jótállási kötelezettsége az alkalmazásunkkal kapcsolatosan. Az alkalmazásunkkal kapcsolatos bármely egyéb igénye kizárólag a mi felelősségi körünkbe tartozik (és nem az Apple-é), és az alkalmazandó jogszabályok és a jelen Szolgáltatási feltételek szerint kerül meghatározásra.
    
* Nem az Apple, hanem mi tartozunk felelősséggel az Ön vagy harmadik fél által az alkalmazásunkkal, illetve az alkalmazásunk használatával vagy birtoklásával kapcsolatban felmerülő bármely követelés kezeléséért. Ez magában foglalja: (i) a termékfelelősséggel kapcsolatos követeléseket; (ii) bármely olyan követelést, amely szerint alkalmazásunk nem felel meg valamely alkalmazandó jogi vagy szabályozási követelménynek; és (iii) bármely olyan követelést, amely a fogyasztóvédelem, az adatvédelem vagy hasonló jogszabályok alapján felmerül.
    
* Ha harmadik fél azt állítja, hogy az alkalmazásunk, vagy az alkalmazásunk használata vagy birtoklása sérti az adott harmadik fél szellemi tulajdonjogait,nem az Apple, hanem kizárólag mi felelünk az ilyen állítás kivizsgálásáért, kivédéséért, rendezéséért és/vagy megszüntetéséért.
    

14.3. Ha az alkalmazásunkat az Apple App Store-ból töltötte le, azzal azt is megerősíti, hogy:

* Ön nem tartózkodik olyan országban, amely az Egyesült Államok kormányának embargója alá esik, vagy amelyet az Egyesült Államok kormánya „terrorizmust támogató” országként nevezett meg; és
    
* Ön nem szerepel az Egyesült Államok kormányának tiltott vagy korlátozott felek listáján.

16.1. Tagként Önnek lehetősége van részt venni a Pets játékban, amely a Szolgáltatásaink olyan funkciója, amely lehetővé teszi, hogy „vásároljon”, „eladjon” és „kereskedjen” virtuális „Pets” háziállatokkal, és közben új személyekkel ismerkedjen meg. Versenyezhet más tagokkal, hogy kiderítse, hogy ki gyűjti össze a legtöbb Pets háziállatot, és kinek a profilja a „legértékesebb”.

16.2. A Pets funkcióhoz történő hozzáféréssel és a jelen feltételek elfogadásával Ön tudomásul veszi és elfogadja, hogy részt vesz a Szolgáltatás részét képező Pets játékban. Ön tudomásul veszi és elfogadja, hogy a Pets játék lehetővé teszi más tagok számára, hogy hozzáférjenek az Ön profilleírásaihoz és képmásaihoz, és ezek a tagok különféleképpen felhasználhatják ezeket a leírásokat és képmásokat. Ez a használat magában foglalhatja az Ön és más tagok „pets” háziállatként történő megjelölését, amelyeket a tagok „birtokolhatnak”, és az ilyen „pets” háziállatok „eladását” (virtuális termékekért cserébe) más tagoknak. Az egyes háziállatokhoz társított „értéket” az általunk meghatározott kritériumok alapján jelölhetünk meg, amely magában foglalhatja az adott háziállatot érintő „eladások” számát és gyakoriságát. Az egyes pet háziállatokhoz rendelt érték idővel változhat. A vállalat olyan rangsorokat és egyéb adatokat tehet közzé, amelyek a tagok tulajdonában lévő háziállatok értékére vonatkozó hivatkozásokat vagy számításokat tartalmaznak. Azzal, hogy taggá válik, Ön visszavonhatatlanul engedélyt, jóváhagyást, felhatalmazást és licencet ad nekünk és kapcsolt vállalkozásainknak, jogutódainknak és megbízottjainknak, hogy használjuk és engedélyezzük másoknak, beleértve más tagokat is, hogy az Ön képét, képmását, megjelenését, profilinformációit, vagy más személyes jellemzőit a Pets játék vagy a Szolgáltatás egyéb műveleteivel kapcsolatban örökre, az Ön további hozzájárulása nélkül, és jogdíj, kifizetés vagy más kompenzáció nélkül felhasználják.

TÁJÉKOZTATÁS AZ ELÁLLÁSI JOGRÓL
-------------------------------

### ELÁLLÁSI JOG

Önnek jogában áll tizennégy napon belül, indoklás nélkül elállni a szerződéstől.

Az elállás időtartama a szerződéskötéstől számított tizennégy nap.

Az elállási joga gyakorlásához értesítenie kell minket (The Meet Group, Inc., 100 Union Square Drive, New Hope, PA 18938, USA, [support@themeetgroup.com](mailto:support@themeetgroup.com)) egy egyértelmű nyilatkozat útján (pl. postai úton vagy e-mailben küldött levélben) arról, hogy el kíván állni a szerződéstől. Ehhez használhatja a csatolt elállási formanyomtatványt, de ez nem kötelező.

Az elállási határidő betartásához elég, ha az elállási jog gyakorlásáról szóló értesítést az elállási határidő lejárta előtt elküldi.

### AZ ELÁLLÁS KÖVETKEZMÉNYEI

Ha Ön eláll a szerződéstől, akkor az Öntől beérkezett minden befizetést, beleértve a szállítási költségeket is (kivéve az abból eredő további költségeket, hogy Ön az általunk felajánlott legolcsóbb standard szállítási módtól eltérő szállítási módot választott), késedelem nélkül, de legkésőbb attól a naptól számított tizennégy napon belül, amikor a szerződéstől történő elállásáról szóló értesítést megkaptuk, visszatérítjük Önnek. A visszafizetéshez ugyanazt a fizetési módot alkalmazzuk, amelyet Ön az eredeti tranzakció során használt, kivéve, ha Önnel kifejezetten másképp állapodtunk meg; a visszafizetés semmilyen esetben sem kerül kiszámlázásra.

2.1. Pentru a accesa și utiliza serviciul va trebui să vă înregistrați. Pentru a face acest lucru, va trebui să alegeți o opțiune de înregistrare disponibilă, cum ar fi e-mail, SMS, conectarea cu Apple, conectarea cu Google sau Facebook și să furnizați acreditările de conectare, cum ar fi adresa de e-mail și o parolă la alegere.

Dacă trebuie să vă actualizați profilul sau informațiile de înregistrare, puteți face acest lucru în orice moment prin intermediul profilului.

Obligațiile contractuale esențiale (obligații principale) sunt acelea a căror îndeplinire permite în primul rând implementarea corespunzătoare a contractului și pe a căror îndeplinire se poate baza în mod normal partenerul contractual. În astfel de cazuri, vom răspunde pentru o sumă de despăgubire, așa cum ar fi tipic pentru daune previzibile într-un astfel de contract. Altfel, răspunderea este exclusă.

Înțelegeți și sunteți de acord că jocul Pets permite altor membri să aibă acces la descrierile și aprecierile profilului dvs., iar acești membri pot utiliza acele descrieri și aprecieri în diferite moduri. Această utilizare poate include desemnarea dvs. și a altor membri ca „animale de companie” pe care membrii le pot „deține” și „vânzarea” (pentru bunuri virtuale) unor astfel de „animale de companie” altor membri. Putem indica o „valoare” asociată fiecărui animal de companie, pe baza criteriilor stabilite de noi, care pot include numărul și frecvența „vânzărilor” care implică acel animal de companie. Valoarea atribuită fiecărui animal de companie poate fluctua în timp. Compania poate publica clasamente și alte date care includ referințe sau calcule ale valorii animalelor de companie deținute de membri. Devenind membru, ne permiteți, autorizați, acordați și licențiați irevocabil nouă și afiliaților noștri, succesorilor și cesionaților noștri, să utilizăm și să permitem altora , inclusiv altor membri, să vă folosească imaginea, asemănarea, aspectul, informații de profil sau alte caracteristici personale în legătură cu funcționarea jocului Pets sau cu alte operațiuni ale serviciului, în perpetuitate, fără consimțământul dvs. suplimentar și fără redevență, plată sau altă compensație.
