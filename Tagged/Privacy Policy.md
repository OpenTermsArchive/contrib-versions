If you come to our Sites from a different device or from a different browser on the same device, you will need to apply GPC for that browser and/or device as well.

* **Right to Limit Use and Disclosure**. You have the right to limit use and disclose of your sensitive personal information. However, we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information beyond the purposes authorized by the CCPA; thus, this right is not available to California residents.

**Submitting CCPA Requests**. California residents may exercise their CCPA privacy rights as set forth below:

* **Right to Know, Delete, and Correct**. California residents may submit CCPA requests to access/know, delete, and correct their personal by contacting us at [support@themeetgroup.com](mailto:support@themeetgroup.com).

When you submit a request, we will take steps to verify your identity and request by matching the information provided by you with the information we have in our records. In some cases, we may request additional information in order to verify your identity, or where necessary to process your request. If we are unable to verify your identity after a good faith attempt, we may deny the request and, if so, will explain the basis for the denial.

You may also designate someone as an authorized agent to submit requests and act on your behalf. Authorized agents will be required to provide proof of their authorization in their first communication with us, and we may also require that the relevant consumer directly verify their identity and the authority of the authorized agent.

* **Right to Opt-Out of Sales and Sharing**. To exercise your right to opt-out of the "sale" or "sharing" of your personal information, you may do so via our cookie preference manager. We will apply your opt out based upon the personal information in our records that is linked or reasonably linkable to the information provided in your request. You may also click the "_Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information_" link at the bottom of our Sites and in our Mobile App.

In addition, if we detect that your browser or device is transmitting an opt-out preference signal, such as the "global privacy control" (or GPC) signal, we will opt that browser or device out of cookies that result in a "sale" or "sharing" of your personal information. If you come to our Sites or use our Services from a different device or from a different browser on the same device, you will need to opt-out, or use an opt-out preference signal, for that browser and/or device as well. More information about GPC is available at: [https://globalprivacycontrol.org/](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/).

**Notice of Financial Incentive**. With respect to some of our Services, TMG may make available certain programs or offerings, and other sweepstakes, contests, or similar promotional offerings (each a "Program") which may include certain offers, rewards, discounts, services, perks, and promotions ("Rewards and Offers"). These Programs may be considered "financial incentives" under the CCPA. We provide these Rewards and Offers to participating users in order to understand and improve customer satisfaction and experiences, and to foster positive customer relationships.

As a basis for offering these Rewards and Offers, we have valued the personal information we obtain based on a reasonable and good faith calculation determined by considering expenses related to the Programs. In doing so, we value the personal information collected through the programs as the equivalent of the costs and expenses incurred to provide the program, including IT, administration, direct costs, third party costs, discounts, and service development costs.

Your personal information is collected and retained, and may be disclosed to our business partners, vendors and service providers, and other third parties, as described in this Policy, including in order (i) to administer the Program, (ii) for research and analytics purposes, (iii) to improve our products and services, (iv) to better reach you with more relevant, targeted offers, and (v) to send you TMG news, updates and offers by email, postal mail, and text message (in accordance with your communications preferences).

You may withdraw from participating in a Program at any time by contacting us using the methods described in this Policy. Please note that if you withdraw from a Program (or submit a CCPA request to delete your Program information), your participation in that Program will be terminated, which means that you will no longer be eligible to earn, use, access or redeem any Program Rewards and Offers, subject to the applicable Program terms.

**California's Shine the Light Law**. Under California's "Shine the Light" law (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.83), California residents who provide us certain personal information are entitled to request and obtain from us, free of charge, information about the personal information (if any) we have shared with third parties for their own direct marketing use. Such requests may be made once per calendar year for information about any relevant third-party sharing in the prior calendar year.

**A. GDPR**

If you are a resident of the European Union, you have the following rights under GDPR provided that the legal requirements therein are met:

**Right of access** - You may request information about the processing of your personal data and a copy of the personal data undergoing processing insofar as such copy does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others and no other exception applies.

**Right to rectification** - You may request correction of your personal data that is inaccurate and/or completion of such data which is incomplete.

**Right to erasure** - You may request deletion of your personal data, in particular where

* the personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed,
    
* you have withdrawn your consent on which the processing was based and there is no other legal basis for the processing,
    
* you objected to the processing which is based on the legal basis "legitimate interests" and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing or you objected to the processing for direct marketing purposes,
    
* your personal data has been unlawfully processed or
    
* your personal data has to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject.
    

The right to erasure, however, does not apply in particular where the processing of your personal data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

**Right to restriction of processing** - You may request restriction of processing

* for the period in which we verify the accuracy of your personal data if you contested the accuracy of the personal data,
    
* where the processing is unlawful and you request restriction of processing instead of erasure of the data,
    
* where we no longer need the personal data, but you require the data for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims, or
    
* if you objected to processing which is based on the legal basis "legitimate interests" until it has been verified whether our legitimate grounds override your interests, rights, and freedoms.
    

**Right to data portability** - You may request to receive your personal data, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used machine-readable format and transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from us, where the processing is based on consent or the performance of a contract and the processing is carried out by automated means; in these cases, you may also request to have the personal data transmitted directly to another controller where this is technically feasible.

Furthermore, you have the following rights:

**Right to withdraw consent -** You may withdraw your consent at any time for the future where processing is based on your consent, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

**Right to object -**

**You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to processing of your personal data which is based on our or a third party's legitimate interest (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR). We then will no longer process your personal data for the purpose to which you have objected, unless we are able to demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights, and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.**

**Further, you have the right to object at any time to processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes. Where you object to processing for direct marketing purposes, we will process your personal data no longer for such purposes.**
