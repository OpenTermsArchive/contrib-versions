### I. What This Privacy Policy Covers

This Privacy Policy describes how our mobile applications, websites and products collect, store, use, and share your personal information. It also describes how you can control and protect your privacy on our Services.

This Privacy Policy does _not_ apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, such as companies that advertise on our Services. For example, companies that advertise on our Services may tag your device or computer with cookies. We do not control these third party cookies and their privacy policies may differ from ours.

### II. Controlling and Protecting Your Privacy

1.  **Personal Safety**. After getting to know someone online, you may choose to meet him or her in-person. If so, be careful and use common sense. Never meet someone in private for the first time; choose a public place, and take a friend. For more information about staying safe, please visit [The Meet Group Safety page](http://www.themeetgroup.com/safety-practices).
    
2.  **Account Settings**. You can change your account settings at any time. You should review these settings regularly.
    
3.  **Deleting Your Account**. You can edit or delete information that you upload to our Services and you can delete your account, but you cannot recall or delete information that others have copied. When you delete your account, some or all of your information may remain on our servers, but you will not be able to access it.
    
4.  **Deleting Your Information and Content**. You can request that we delete your posted information and content. To do so, send an email to [support@themeetgroup.com](mailto:support@themeetgroup.com) from the email address associated with your account, requesting deletion.
    
5.  **Location Information**. We collect your location when you first register with our Services and each time you log in on a mobile device. You can control whether other users see your location after initial log in through your operating system’s settings. We may still use your location (such as for security or advertising purposes) even if you choose not to display it to other users.
    
    We do not “track” your precise location, but we do collect location information from your device or browser when you log in or use our Services, such as when you visit a particular feature that uses location. In addition, as with most location-enabled applications, we and our third-party partners may access your location any time your device is on, whether or not you are logged-in to our Services. We do not share your precise location with other users.
    
6.  **Password**. Store your password in a safe place, and do not share it with anyone. If you think someone has your password, change it immediately.
    
7.  **Posting Information**. Posting personal information on public areas of our Services will make it publicly available. The personal information you post or share with others may in turn be shared by them with still other users and it may also show up when someone uses a public search engine (even if that person is not a user of our Services). **Do not post personal information in public areas of our Services that you want to keep private**.
    
8.  **Third Parties**. We are not responsible for (and don’t have any control over) the privacy policies of third party websites, apps and ad servers. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of each and every website and app you visit.
    
9.  **Opting Out of Receiving Cookies**. You may set your browser to block some or all cookies. However, our Services might not fully function if you disable cookies. If you use multiple devices, browsers or computers, you will need to opt out of receiving cookies on each one. Also, if you change devices or computers you will need to repeat this opt-out process. You may also be able to opt-out of receiving cookies from some advertisers.
    
    Many Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. You may click on the following links: [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) and [http://www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) for information on how to opt-out of the use of cookies or web beacons. You may also be able to opt-out of receiving cookies through the [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) in the USA, the [Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada](http://youradchoices.ca/) of Canada in Canada, or the [European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) in Europe.
    
10.  **Limit Mobile Ad Tracking**. You may set your mobile device to limit ad tracking, in which case we will not be able to see your AdID or IDFA. However, we will still share other personal information to our advertising partners as described in this Privacy Policy.
    
11.  **Do Not Track Signals**. Some Internet browsers include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” signals, but there are no uniform standards for this. We do not process or respond to “Do Not Track” signals.

In addition, in the course of providing our Services on third party platforms, such as the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store, the platforms may collect information about you or receive information from us in order for that platform to provide and analyze their services.

You should carefully review the terms of service and privacy policies of the platforms that you use to access our Services.
