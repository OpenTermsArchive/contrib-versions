**Revised September 16, 2014**

Thank you for choosing Allstate. We value you, respect your privacy and work hard to protect your personal information.  
  
This statement is provided on behalf of Allstate Insurance Company and the affiliates ("Allstate") listed at the end of this notice. We would like to explain how we collect, use and share the information we obtain about you in the course of doing business.

The Truste certification covers:  
  

*   Allstate.com
*   Miallstate.com
*   M.allstate.com
*   M.miallstate.com
*   Goodhandsroadside.allstate.com
*   Mobile application for Allstate
*   Mobile application for Good Hands Roadside

Our Privacy Assurance

*   We do **not** sell your personal or medical information to anyone.
*   We do **not** share your information with non-affiliate companies that would use it to contact you about their own products and services, unless permitted pursuant to a joint marketing agreement.
*   We **require** persons or organizations that represent or assist us in servicing your policy and claims to keep your information confidential.
*   We **require** our employees to protect your personal information and keep it confidential.

  
As you can see, protecting your personal information is important to us. In addition to the practices described above, we use a variety of physical, technical and administrative security measures that help to safeguard your information. For Social Security Numbers (SSN), this includes restricting access to our employees, agents and others who use your SSN only as permitted by law, such as to comply with the law, to provide you with products and services or to handle your claims. Our privacy practices continue to apply to your information even if you cease to be an Allstate customer. What Personal Information Do We Have and Where Do We Get It

We gather personal information from you and from outside sources for business purposes. Some examples of the information we collect from you may include your name, phone number, home and e-mail addresses, driver's license number, social security number, marital status, family member information and healthcare information. Also, we maintain records that include, but are not limited to, policy coverages, premiums, and payment history. We also collect information from outside sources that may include, but is not limited to, your driving record, claims history, medical information and credit information. Your information is stored in an encrypted environment.  
  
In addition, Allstate and its business partners gather information through Internet activity, which may include, for example, your operating system, links you used to visit allstate.com, web pages you viewed while visiting our site or applications, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, and cookies. We use cookies, analytics and other technologies to help:

*   Evaluate our marketing campaigns
*   Analyze how customers use our website and applications
*   Develop new services

Also, our business partners assist us with monitoring information including, but not limited to, IP addresses, domain names and browser data, which can help us to better understand how visitors use allstate.com. Mobile Analytics

We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile app.

Location Services

If you choose, your location is obtained from the mobile device or the network using your device's GPS functionality, or directly from you. We use your location information to  

*   search for information you request - including agent searches
*   identify the location of an accident you are reporting

  
Your location information is stored on Allstate's servers and retained by Allstate until you delete the application from your device. When we execute such searches on your behalf we do not transfer your identity or personally identifiable information to third parties, other than with service providers necessary to help perform this function. This information is not used to create a profile about you or your activities.  
To prevent Allstate from using your current location, you can disable the GPS functionality on your mobile device or choose not to submit current location when prompted. How We Use and Share Your Personal Information

In the course of normal business activities, we use and share your personal information. We may provide your information to persons or organizations within and outside of Allstate. This would be done as required or permitted by law. For example, we may do this to:  

*   Fulfill a transaction you requested or service your policy
*   Market our products
*   Handle your claim
*   Prevent fraud
*   Comply with requests from regulatory and law enforcement authorities
*   Participate in insurance support organizations
*   Send you push notifications
