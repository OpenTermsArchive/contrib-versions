Privacy rights and choices
--------------------------

Various federal and state laws provide privacy rights to consumers including the right to know, access, delete, or correct personal information, the right to opt-out of sharing of personal information with affiliates for marketing or the right to opt-out of receiving email marketing. These rights differ by state and also by the type of products and services you have with Allstate. For example, the rights to know, access, delete or correct under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) do not apply to personal information that is subject to certain federal and state laws governing insurance or health information.

**Email marketing choices and other notifications:** We may send you email marketing communications about products, features and services that may be of interest to you. To opt out from receiving marketing and promotional emails from us, please send us a request by email at [customerprivacy@allstate.com](mailto:customerprivacy@allstate.com) or click the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each communication. If you opt out from receiving marketing emails, we may still send you non-marketing emails such as emails about your products or services, responses to your requests and inquiries, or notices of updates to terms and conditions or our privacy practices.

If you use My Account you can also manage email and other notifications and marketing preferences via the Notifications in the Settings menu.
