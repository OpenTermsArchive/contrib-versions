Privacy Policy Statement En Español Download

  
  

**Revised February 13, 2017**

Thank you for choosing Allstate. We value you, respect your privacy and work hard to protect your personal information.  
  
This statement is provided on behalf of Allstate Insurance Company and the affiliates ("Allstate") listed at the end of this notice. We would like to explain how we collect, use and share the information we obtain about you in the course of doing business. It also describes the choices available to you regarding the use of, your access to, and how to update and correct your personal information.

Our Privacy Assurance

*   We do **not** sell your personal or medical information to anyone.
*   We do **not** share your information with non-affiliate companies that would use it to contact you about their own products and services, unless permitted pursuant to a joint marketing agreement.
*   We **require** persons or organizations that represent or assist us in servicing your policy and claims to keep your information confidential.
*   We **require** our employees to protect your personal information and keep it confidential.

  
As you can see, protecting your personal information is important to us. In addition to the practices described above, we use a variety of physical, technical and administrative security measures that help to safeguard your information. For Social Security Numbers (SSN), Date of Birth (DOB), payment information, and other sensitive personal information, this includes restricting access to our employees, agents and others who use such information only as permitted by law, such as to comply with the law, to provide you with products and services or to handle your claims. Our privacy practices continue to apply to your information even if you cease to be an Allstate customer.

What Personal Information Do We Have and Where Do We Get It?

We gather personal information from you and from outside sources for business purposes, including carrying out the requested product or services, responding to customer service requests, administering your account, and sending you newsletters and other service related correspondence. Some examples of the information we collect from you may include your name, phone number, home and e-mail addresses, driver's license number, date of birth, social security number, marital status, family member information, payment information, and healthcare information. Also, we maintain records that include, but are not limited to, policy coverages, premiums, and payment history. We also collect information from outside sources that may include, but is not limited to, your driving record, claims history, medical information and credit information.  
  
We may also collect third-party information from you to carry out the necessary services and/or requests, including adding another driver to your existing policy. If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us  
  
In addition, Allstate and its business partners gather information through Internet activity, which may include, for example, your operating system, links you used to visit allstate.com, web pages you viewed while visiting our site or applications, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, and cookies. We use cookies, analytics and other technologies to help:

*   Evaluate our marketing campaigns
*   Analyze how customers use our website and applications
*   Develop new services
*   Know how many visitors have seen or clicked on our ads

  
Also, our business partners assist us with monitoring information including, but not limited to, IP addresses, domain names and browser data, which can help us to better understand how visitors use allstate.com.

We use Mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We will link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile app.

Location Services

If you choose, your location is obtained from the mobile device or the network using your device's GPS functionality, or directly from you. We use your location information to  

*   search for information you request - including agent searches
*   identify the location of an accident you are reporting

  
Your location information is stored on Allstate's servers and retained by Allstate until you delete the application from your device. When we execute such searches on your behalf we do not transfer your identity or personally identifiable information to third parties, other than with service providers necessary to help perform this function. This information is not used to create a profile about you or your activities.  
To prevent Allstate from using your current location, you can disable the GPS functionality on your mobile device or choose not to submit current location when prompted.

*   Prevent fraud
*   Comply with requests from regulatory and law enforcement authorities. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
*   Participate in insurance support organizations
*   Send you push notifications. If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off at the device level.
