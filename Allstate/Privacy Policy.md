Our Privacy Assurance

*   We do **not** sell your personal or medical information to anyone.
*   We do **not** share your information with non-affiliate companies that would use it to contact you about their own products and services, unless permitted pursuant to a joint marketing agreement.
*   We **require** persons or organizations that represent or assist us in servicing your policy and claims to keep your information confidential.
*   We **require** our employees to protect your personal information and keep it confidential.

  
As you can see, protecting your personal information is important to us. In addition to the practices described above, we use a variety of physical, technical and administrative security measures that help to safeguard your information. For Social Security Numbers (SSN), this includes restricting access to our employees, agents and others who use your SSN only as permitted by law, such as to comply with the law, to provide you with products and services or to handle your claims. Our privacy practices continue to apply to your information even if you cease to be an Allstate customer. What Personal Information Do We Have and Where Do We Get It

We gather personal information from you and from outside sources for business purposes. Some examples of the information we collect from you may include your name, phone number, home and e-mail addresses, driver's license number, social security number, marital status, family member information and healthcare information.

Your location information is stored on Allstate's servers and retained by Allstate until you delete the application from your device.
