---------------------------------

We retain personal information in accordance with applicable laws or regulatory requirements and also for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and to fulfill the business or commercial purposes that are explained in this Privacy Statement.

Online tracking technologies and advertising
--------------------------------------------

**Technologies and information collected:** We and our service providers operating on our behalf may collect information about your activity on, use of and access to our Sites using a variety of tracking technologies, including cookies, Flash objects, web beacons (also called pixel tags), embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, and similar technology (collectively, “tracking technologies”). Information we may collect this way may be combined with other personal information we collect directly from you, including information we collect from you offline, such as over the phone or in a retail location. The information collected in this manner includes:

* The website from where you accessed our Sites, where you went to when you left our Sites, how frequently you visit our Sites, your location when you access our Sites, when and whether you open emails or click the links contained in emails, pages you visit and ads you view on our Sites, recordings of mouse clicks, mouse movements, keystrokes, and other communications you make on our Sites,
* Information about the computer, tablet, smartphone or other device you use, such as your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, platform type, device type/model/manufacturer, operating system, date and time stamp, a unique ID that allows us to uniquely identify your browser, mobile device or your account (including, e.g., a persistent device identifier or an Ad ID), and other similar information,
* Analytics information collected by us or via third party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Sites and to understand more about the demographics and behaviors of our users, and
* How often you use a mobile app, from where the app was downloaded, events that occur within the app, aggregated usage, and performance data.

**Use of the information:** The information collected through tracking technologies allows us to provide you with an improved, enhanced, and personalized customer experience, to monitor and improve our Sites and for other internal purposes such as:

* Remembering information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Sites,

* Identify and contact you across multiple devices,
* Provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Sites,
* Perform analytics and detect usage patterns on our Sites,
* Diagnose or fix technology problems, and
* Detect or prevent fraud or other harmful activities..

**General choices regarding cookies:** If you prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to manage cookies in your browser settings to disable or block cookies, remove existing cookies, automatically accept cookies or to notify you when you receive a cookie. These settings are browser or device specific. Options available may vary by browser. However, if you disable, modify, or reject cookies, some parts or functionalities of our Site may be inaccessible or not function properly. For example, disabling cookies may require you to repeatedly enter information to take advantage of services or promotions. Also, if you clear your cookies on your browser or make selections using a different device or browser, you may need to redo your cookie settings.

**Targeted Online Advertising and Opt-outs:** We or our online marketing and advertising providers may use information about your activities on our Sites or other websites to help tailor our advertisements or offers to your interests. With some of our Sites, we provide information about your online activities to third-party advertising companies, or allow those advertising companies to collect the information using cookies and similar technologies, and allow the advertising companies to combine that information with information they collect on other unrelated sites to provide you with relevant, targeted advertising. This sort of online advertising is called cross-context behavioral advertising under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) or targeted online advertising under other laws. We do not knowingly share personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising of users under the age of sixteen.

Some states provide individuals the right to opt-out of the “sharing” or “selling” your personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising or of “targeted advertising” based on their personal information. You may opt-out of this sharing or the targeted advertising via the “about ads/do not sell or share my personal information” link in the footer of our website and then selecting “Opt out of targeted online advertising” or by visiting our preference center and selecting “Opt out of targeted online advertising.”

You may also, where available, opt-out by enabling a universal tool that automatically communicates your opt-out preferences such as the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) setting of your browser. For more information about GPCs, visit https://globalprivacycontrol.org. You can also limit receiving certain targeted online advertising referred to as Interest-Based Advertising by visiting [NAI Consumer Opt Out (networkadvertising.org)](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1).

Some browsers offer a setting called “Do Not Track.” Although we do our best to honor the privacy preferences of our visitors, we may not be able to respond to all “Do Not Track” signals from your browser.

Opt-out choices may be browser, device and/or website specific. If you access other Allstate family of company websites, you may need to make a separate selection for each. Also, clearing cookies or browsing history will erase your opt-out selection. You may continue to see generic or non-targeted ads about our products and services if you opt-out of sharing for cross-context behavioral advertising or targeted online advertising.

Various federal and state laws provide privacy rights to consumers including the right to know, access, delete, or correct personal information, the right to opt-out of sharing of personal information with affiliates for marketing or the right to opt-out of receiving email marketing.

If we transfer personal information to a third party, the third party’s access, use, and disclosure of the personal information must also be in compliance with our Data Privacy Framework obligations, and we will remain liable under the Data Privacy Framework for any failure to do so by the third party unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
