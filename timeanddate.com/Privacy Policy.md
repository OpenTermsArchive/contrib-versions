Privacy Statement
=================

We have a firm commitment to your privacy and data transparency at timeanddate.com.

![Illustration of privacy statement document](//c.tadst.com/gfx/600x337/og-privacy-statement.png?1)

We value your privacy.

This page discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for [timeanddate.com](https://www.timeanddate.com/). It also includes information regarding the processing of privacy information as stated in the new EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of May 25, 2018.

Lawful Basis for Processing Personal Data
-----------------------------------------

We store some personal data in three cases:

1.  When consent is given by users
2.  When processing is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests, such as the basic functionality of our site and services
3.  When processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation, such as storing payment records for our [supporters and subscribers](https://www.timeanddate.com/custom/subscriptions.html)

Personal Data We Process
------------------------

At timeanddate.com, we process some personal data. Below is a description of what, how, and why we gather and store user data.

For all users who visit our website, we store:

*   Web server log: IP address, pages visited by that IP address, link clicked to get here, browser name and version, and time stamp
*   Third parties collect similar information; see “Third-Party Privacy Policies” below

For all users who actively make changes to site settings, we store:

[Setting preferences](https://www.timeanddate.com/custom/site.html), which are not personally identifiable, i.e., the cookies are stored in the browser and not on our servers. These settings include:

*   [Calendar](https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/) settings
*   [Preferred units](https://www.timeanddate.com/custom/site.html) (temperature, distance, wind speed, etc.)
*   Cities in your [Personal World Clock](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/personal.html)
*   [“Home” location](https://www.timeanddate.com/custom/location.html)

For users who sign in to their [personal user account](https://www.timeanddate.com/custom/create.html), we also store:

*   Your email address (will not be sold nor distributed to any third party unrelated to timeanddate.com)
*   Your password (hashed)
*   Your chosen username, if any
*   List of log-ins (stored for up to 90 days)
*   Log of changes you made to your account (stored for up to 90 days)
*   [Events added](https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/events/) in PDF calendar lists

For [newsletter subscribers](https://www.timeanddate.com/newsletter/subscribe.html), we store:

*   Email address, IP address, and time of sign-up
*   Newsletters received and opened
*   Additional parameters may be stored by [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/), who we use to send our newsletter; see “Third-Party Privacy Policies” below

For paying [supporters and subscribers](https://www.timeanddate.com/custom/subscriptions.html), in addition to the above-mentioned data, we also store:

*   Payment information: either the PayPal address or the last four digits of the credit card used for payment and a log of the steps taken to fulfill your order (stored for up to 90 days)
*   Country of residence and, if submitted, street address, state, city, and ZIP/postal code
*   Email address, if different than the one registered for the user account
*   We use [Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com/en-cy/legal/braintree-privacy-policy) and [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/de/webapps/mpp/ua/privacypps-full?locale.x=en_DE) for payments; see “Third-Party Privacy Policies” below

IP Address and Cookies
----------------------

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our websites. Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information. We use [cookies](https://www.timeanddate.com/custom/cookies.html) to deliver content specific to your interests.

Short-lived cookies die when you close the browser. Most long-lived cookies are stored for 10 years (1 year in the EU), to ensure your settings are not lost even if you visit the site infrequently, e.g., such as printing a calendar once a year. All cookies are stored in your browser, so your settings are lost when the cookies are deleted. You can avoid losing your settings by registering a free [user account](https://www.timeanddate.com/custom/create.html).

When creating an account, you agree to our [terms and conditions](https://www.timeanddate.com/information/terms-conditions.html).

Servers and Content Distribution
--------------------------------

Our servers are located in the USA, Germany, Singapore, Australia, and Norway. We also rely on third parties to host our services and our infrastructure, and to distribute our content, such as the newsletter.

We take regular backups of our servers. Older backups are stored offline and are only used to recover data after a server crash or other incidents.

Sensitive Information
---------------------

We have security measures in place. We will never ask for sensitive information. In the GDPR, “sensitive information” is defined as: “personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation.” We recommend you do not add such information to our services, such as calendars, countdowns, or any other timeanddate.com application.

External Links
--------------

This site contains links to other sites. timeanddate.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of the linked websites.

We use [SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/privacy-policy/?ut_source=footer) for online surveys. We may ask for your contact information, such as your email address. This information is used to contact you if necessary.
