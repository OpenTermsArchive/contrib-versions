IP Address and Cookies
----------------------

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our websites. Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information. We use [cookies](https://www.timeanddate.com/custom/cookies.html) to deliver content specific to your interests.

Short-lived cookies die when you close the browser. Most long-lived cookies are stored for 10 years (1 year in the EU), to ensure your settings are not lost even if you visit the site infrequently, e.g., such as printing a calendar once a year. All cookies are stored in your browser, so your settings are lost when the cookies are deleted. You can avoid losing your settings by registering a free [user account](https://www.timeanddate.com/custom/create.html).

When creating an account, you agree to our [terms and conditions](https://www.timeanddate.com/information/terms-conditions.html).

Our servers are located in the USA, Germany, Singapore, Australia, and Norway. We also rely on third parties to host our services and our infrastructure, and to distribute our content, such as the newsletter.

We take regular backups of our servers. Older backups are stored offline and are only used to recover data after a server crash or other incidents.
