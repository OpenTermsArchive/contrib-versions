In the context of an onward transfer, Bitwarden has responsibility for the processing of Personal Information it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf.

We may also provide your Personal Information to a third party in connection with a merger or acquisition of Bitwarden, either in part or in whole, or the assignment or other transfer of the Site or Service. In such event, such third party will either:

Accessing and Deleting Your Personal Information
------------------------------------------------

Right to request access to your Personal Information

You, as a California resident, have the right to request that we disclose what categories of Personal Information that we collect, use, or sell about you. You may also request the specific pieces of Personal Information that we have collected about you. However, we may withhold some information where the risk to you, your Personal Information, or our business is too great to disclose the information.

Right to request deletion of your Personal Information

You may also request that we delete any Personal Information that we have collected from/about you. However, we may retain Personal Information as authorized under applicable law, such as Personal Information required as necessary to provide our services, protect our business and systems from fraudulent activity, to debug and identify errors that impair existing functionality, as necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, for scientific or historical research, for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations. We need certain types of information so that we can provide our services. If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use our services.

How to exercise your access and deletion rights

California residents may exercise their California privacy rights by submitting a request via email at privacypolicy@bitwarden.com. While email is the best way to reach us, you may also call us at the number listed in the [Contact Us](https://bitwarden.com/privacy/#_b8cr19hq076a) section.

For security purposes, we may request additional information from you to verify your identity when you request to exercise your California privacy rights. If you do not have an account with us, or if we have reason to suspect that the security of your account is compromised, we will request additional information from you to match with our existing records to verify your identity, depending on the nature of the request and the sensitivity of the information sought.

Sales of Personal Information

California residents may opt out of the "sale" of their Personal Information. We do not "sell" your Personal Information as we understand that term to be defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act and its implementing regulations.
