_Effective Date: June 2012  
Last Updated: January 1, 2020_

Your privacy and trust are important to us. This Privacy Statement explains how Thomson Reuters Holdings Inc. and the Thomson Reuters group of companies (we refer to these as “**Thomson Reuters**”, “**we**”, “**us**”, or “**our**”) collect, use, and share your personal information in connection with the website, application (including a mobile application), product, software, or service that links to this Privacy Statement (we call these our “**Services**”).

This Privacy Statement, however, does **not** apply to:

*   Our customers’ “content” that is inputted/uploaded and processed, stored, or hosted by our customers using our Services in connection with their account with us, in which this personal information is governed by our customers’ respective privacy policies;
*   The “content” that is distributed within our Services (including with respect to personal information included in such content), although this is addressed in our **[Informational Content Privacy Statement](#content-distributed "Informational Content Privacy Statement")**; or
*   Any website, application, product, software, service, or content that are offered by third parties or that link to their own privacy statement, privacy policy, or privacy notice.

Importantly, some laws (like GDPR) distinguish between a “controller” and a “processor” (or similar terms). We note that we are a “controller” for those Services where we make decisions on how personal information is used in connection with our Services, and we are a “processor” for those Services where we only use personal information as allowed by our customers.

Where we make decisions on how personal information is used in connection with our Services (where we are acting as a controller), we are responsible for the obligations of a “controller” under applicable laws in connection with the processing of personal information – for example, we use this Privacy Statement and other notices to provide you with information about our use of personal information, as required by law. Where we only use personal information as allowed by our customers (where we are acting as a processor), our customers are similarly responsible for the obligations of a “controller” under applicable laws in connection with the processing of personal information, and, if you are using our Services through one of our customers, you should contact them if you have questions or concerns about the processing of your personal information or compliance with applicable laws.

For **California Consumers**, we have also prepared a _Supplemental Privacy Statement for California Consumers under CCPA_ (“**California Statement**”) in compliance with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“**CCPA**”). Please review our [California Statement](#california "California Statement") attached below for more information.

Thomson Reuters supplemental Privacy Statement for California consumers under CCPA
==================================================================================

[DO NOT SELL MY PERSONAL INFORMATION

](https://privacyportal-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/dbf5ae8a-0a6a-4f4b-b527-7f94d0de6bbc/5dc91c0f-f1b7-4b6e-9d42-76043adaf72d.html)

Introduction  

---------------

As a global company, our business proudly serves certain natural persons residing in the State of California (each, a “**consumer**”). This _Supplemental Privacy Statement for California Consumers under CCPA_ (“**California Statement**”) explains rights that California consumers may have under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“**CCPA**”).

When we use the term “**personal information**” in this supplemental California Statement, we are using that term as CCPA defines it, which CCPA generally defines “**personal information**” to mean information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household. However, personal information does not include publicly available, deidentified, or aggregate consumer information (which are all defined in CCPA). Notably, the definition of “**personal information**” also does not apply to the collection of personal information from job applicants, employees – whether you are our employee or any employee of the entity arranging access to our Services for you, business owners, directors, officers, medical staff, or contractors.

Categories of personal information we collect, the sources of that information, purposes for why we collect it, who we share it with, and whether we sell that personal information  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where we act as a “business” under CCPA (meaning we determine the manner and reasons for why we process your personal information), we may be required to disclose additional information regarding the categories of personal information we collect, the sources where we obtain that information, the purposes for why we collect that information, who we share that information with, as well as whether we sell that personal information – all of which depends on the specific Service. Accordingly, we’ve provided additional Service-specific information for subject Services on our website located at [tr.com/privacy-information](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/privacy-information.html).

Your privacy rights  

----------------------

If you are a resident of California and are not a job applicant, employee/contractor, or employee/contractor of another company interacting with us in your job role, you have the right to request what information we collect, use, and disclose. You also have the right to request that we delete your information.

To make a request, you can contact us through our [Data Subject Rights Portal](https://privacyportal-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/dbf5ae8a-0a6a-4f4b-b527-7f94d0de6bbc/5dc91c0f-f1b7-4b6e-9d42-76043adaf72d.html) or at 1-866-633-7656. Provide us enough information to verify your identify. We will use information you provide to us to verify your request. If we cannot initially verify your identity, we may request additional information to complete the verification process, such as, for example, a copy of your driver’s license and/or a recent utility or credit card bill. You can designate an agent to make a request on your behalf by either: (1) having your agent send us a letter, signed by you, certifying that the agent is acting on your behalf and showing proof that they are registered with the California Secretary of State; or (2) by you and the agent executing and sending us a notarized power of attorney stating that the agent is authorized to act on your behalf.  Please note that we may still require you to verify your identity before we process a request submitted by your agent.

California residents also have certain rights regarding the sale of personal information.

Thomson Reuters supplemental Privacy Statement for cookie & IBA policy
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Our [Privacy Statement](#privacy-statement "Privacy Statement") explains our principles when it comes to the collection, processing, and storage of your personal information. This Cookie & IBA Policy supplements the above Privacy Statement and specifically explains how we, our partners, and users of our Services deploy cookies and other tracking technologies, including for Interest-Based Advertising (IBA), as well as the options you have to control them.

Cookie policy  

----------------

**_What are Cookies?_**

**Cookies** are small pieces of data, stored in text files, that are stored on your computer or other device when websites are loaded in a browser. They are widely used to “remember” you and your preferences, either for a single visit (through a “**session cookie**”) or for multiple repeat visits (using a “**persistent cookie**”). They ensure a consistent and efficient experience for visitors, and perform essential functions such as allowing users to register and remain logged in. Cookies may be set by the site that you are visiting (known as “**first party cookies**”), or by third parties, such as those who serve content or provide advertising or analytics services on the website (“**third party cookies**”).

Both websites and HTML emails may also contain other tracking technologies such as “**web beacons**” or “**pixels**.” These are typically small transparent images that provide us with statistics, for similar purposes as cookies. They are often used in conjunction with cookies, though they are not stored on your computer in the same way as cookies. As a result, if you disable cookies, web beacons may still load, but their functionality will be restricted.

**Flash cookies**, also known as **local shared objects**, are designed to support browser content supported by Adobe® Flash. They are usually used to enable ads and video content on websites. Like other cookies, they will store information on your device, some of which will be specific to the Flash-enabled content. Flash cookies can only be deleted within Adobe Flash rather than via your browser. Please refer to the following help page for information on how to manage your privacy settings and deletion of Flash cookies: [http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings\_manager.html](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html).

**_How We Use Cookies_**

We use cookies for several different purposes. Some cookies are necessary for technical reasons; some enable a personalized experience for both visitors and registered users; and some allow the display of advertising from selected third party networks. Some of these cookies may be set when a page is loaded, or when a user takes a particular action on one of our Services. Many of the cookies we use are only set if you are a registered user, while others are set whenever you visit or use one of our Services (irrespective of whether you have an account). For more information on the choices you have about the cookies we use, please see Section entitled _[Controlling Cookies](#controlling-cookies "Controlling Cookies")_ below.

**_Where We Place Cookies_**

We set cookies in a number of different locations across our services. These locations may include:

*   Our websites (including tr.com and reuters.com) and other Services;
*   Our mobile apps;
*   The emails we send.

**_Types of Cookies_**

The bullet points below outline the types of cookies we use on our Services and why we use them. We also provide explanations of their purpose(s).

*   **Strictly Necessary**. These cookies are essential for our Services to perform their basic functions. These include cookies that are required to allow registered users to authenticate and perform account related functions, as well as to save the contents of virtual “carts” for e-commerce functionality.
*   **Analytics and Performance**. Performance cookies collect information on how users interact with our Services, including what pages are visited most, as well as other analytical data. We use these details to improve how our Services function and to understand how users interact with our Services.
*   **Functionality**. These cookies are used to store preferences set by users such as account name, language, and location.
*   **Security**. We use these cookies to help identify and prevent potential security risks.
*   **Advertising**. These cookies are used to display relevant advertising to users who use our Services, as well as to understand and report on the efficacy of ads served on our Services. They track details such as the number of unique visitors, the number of times particular ads have been displayed, and the number of clicks the ads have received. They are also used to build user profiles, including showing you ads based on products or services you’ve viewed or acts you have taken on our (and other) websites and services. These are set by us and trusted third party networks, and are generally persistent in nature.
*   **Third Party / Embedded Content**. Services hosted by us make use of different third party applications and services to enhance the experience of Service visitors. These include social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter (through the use of sharing buttons). As a result, cookies may be set by these third parties, and used by them to track your online activity. We have no direct control over the information that is collected by these cookies.

**_Controlling Cookies_**

You may wish to restrict the use of cookies or completely prevent them from being set. Most modern browsers allow you to change your cookie settings. You can usually find these settings in the options or preferences menu of your browser. To understand these settings, the following links for commonly used browsers may be helpful, or you can use the help option in your browser for more details:

*   [Cookie settings in Internet Explorer](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/internet-explorer/delete-manage-cookies#ie=ie-10)
*   [Cookie settings in Firefox](http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Cookies)
*   [Cookie settings in Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en&ref_topic=14666)
*   [Cookie settings in Safari web](https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/manage-cookies-and-website-data-sfri11471/mac) and [iOS](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1677)

If you disable cookies, please be aware that some of the features of our Services may not function correctly.

For more details on your choices regarding use of your web browsing activity for interest-based advertising you may visit the following sites:

*   [networkadvertising.org](http://networkadvertising.org/)
*   [optout.aboutads.info](http://optout.aboutads.info/)
*   [youradchoices.com](http://youradchoices.com/)
*   [youronlinechoices.eu](http://youronlinechoices.eu/)

On a mobile device, you may also be to adjust your settings to limit ad tracking.  

You can opt out of Google Analytics by installing [Google’s opt-out browser add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

**_Do Not Track Signals_**

Generally, we do not currently respond to, or take any action with respect to web browser "do not track" signals or other mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personal information about an individual’s online activities over time and across third party websites or online services. **However**, in some instances our third party service providers who integrate within our Services do honor Do Not Track signals.

**_Consent for Advertising Cookies on Our Sites_**

You may see a “cookie banner” on our websites. If you are visiting one of our Services from the EU/EEA, then we do not set, or allow our ad partners to set, cookies that are used to show you targeted ads before you click to accept. When you consent in this manner, we and our advertising partners may set advertising cookies on the site or other Service you are visiting and on other of our websites, dashboards, and services. We’ll display the banner to you periodically, just in case you change your mind.

Interest-based advertising (IBA) policy  

------------------------------------------

**_Opt-Out of Email Marketing_**

You may choose not to receive future marketing or advertising emails from us by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of each marketing or advertising email that you receive from us. Alternatively, you may send us an opt-out request specifying your communications preferences to [privacy.issues@thomsonreuters.com](mailto:privacy.issues@thomsonreuters.com).  

Please note that, even if you opt-out of receiving marketing or advertising emails, we may still send you transactional emails related to the performance of our Services or your account with us, including administrative emails, maintenance emails, operational emails (for example, in connection with a password reset request), and responses to any “contact” request you initiate.

We may also restart sending you marketing or advertising emails if you later opt-in.

**_Interest-Based Advertising Notice_**

_What is Interest-Based Advertising?_

Interest-based advertising, sometimes referred to as “targeted advertising”, “online behavioral advertising”, and “personalized advertising”, allows us to deliver personalized and/or targeted advertising to individuals that are tailored to individual interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as ad delivery, reporting, attribution, analytics, and market research. We serve interest-based advertising using information you make available to us when you interact with our Services and other sites, content, or products or services, which may be supplemented by third parties as discussed below. We deliver interest-based advertising on Thomson Reuters’s owned and operated sites, on unaffiliated sites, and through our Services.

Like other online advertising networks, we use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to enable us to learn about what ads you are served, what ads you click, and other actions you take on our sites, on other sites, and sometimes offline (collectively, “**Ad Stats**”). This allows us to provide you with more useful and relevant ads.

We allow third party companies to collect certain information when you visit our websites or use our Services. Third party advertisers and other third parties (including ad networks, ad delivery or ad serving companies, and other service providers they may use) may also collect information about your Ad Stats, in which they may use that information to assume that users who interact with or click on a personalized ad or content are part of the group that the ad or content is directed towards. Also, some third parties may provide us with information about you (such as the sites where you have been shown ads, your Ad Stats, and/or demographic information) from offline and online sources that we may use to provide you more relevant and useful advertising.

Advertisers or ad companies working on their behalf sometimes use technology to serve the ads that appear on our sites or Services directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address and/or information from cookies when this happens. They may also use third party cookies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize ad content. We do not have access to or control over third party cookies or other features that advertisers and third party sites may use, and the privacy practices of these advertisers and third party websites are not covered by this Privacy Statement. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices.

_How do I Opt-out of Interest-Based Advertising?_

You may choose not to receive interest-based advertising. Please note that, even if you opt-out of receiving interest-based advertising, you will still receive advertisements and marketing materials, but they will not be personalized to you specifically.

For some of our vendors that participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), you can exercise your online advertising choices for those vendors to opt-out of interest-based advertising at [http://optout.aboutads.info](http://optout.aboutads.info/).  You may also opt out of receiving interest-based ads from many sites through the Network Advertising Initiative's (NAI) Opt Out Tool ([http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices)) and in the EU at [http://www.youronlinechoices.com/](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/).

_How Do I Opt-Out of Advertising on Mobile Devices?_

Mobile devices have an advertising identifier that gives companies the ability to serve targeted ads to a specific mobile device. Depending on your specific device, you may be able to limit advertising or reset the advertising identifier within your mobile device privacy settings. Another tool you can use to control advertising on your mobile device is the AppChoices App: [http://youradchoices.com/appchoices](http://youradchoices.com/appchoices). You may also choose to turn off the device’s location tracking on your mobile device depending on your specific device.

Please note that some of the options described in the paragraphs above that you select are browser-specific or device-specific, so you may need to opt-out again if you delete cookies, use a different device, or change browsers.

Thomson Reuters supplemental Privacy Statement for content distributed with Thomson Reuters Services
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**1\. Introduction**
--------------------

As a global business information services company, our business proudly distributes informational content within our Services. This Supplemental _Privacy Statement for Content Distributed with Thomson Reuters Services_ (“**Informational Content Privacy Statement**”) supplements the above [Privacy Statement](#privacy-statement "Privacy Statement") and further explains how we distribute and curate this informational content.

**2\. Why does Thomson Reuters publish informational content?**
---------------------------------------------------------------

Thomson Reuters publishes various types of content, such as statutes, laws, regulations, rules, court cases, opinions, expert analysis, articles, forms, public records, treatise, dictionaries, and many other types of information, that we believe have professional and jurisprudential value for our customers or the general public.

**3\. How does Thomson Reuters obtain informational content?**
--------------------------------------------------------------

Thomson Reuters obtains informational content in a number of ways – sometimes we purchase or license the content from others, sometimes we receive the content pursuant to a contract where we are required to curate and distribute the content, sometimes we commission the content ourselves, and sometimes the content is collected from a number of public sources, like public records, journalistic sources, and information in the public domain. Any personal information contained in informational content that is subsequently distributed by Thomson Reuters originates from the original text of the informational content.

**4\. How does Thomson Reuters curate informational content?**
--------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to distributing the informational content, Thomson Reuters curates the content – in other words, Thomson Reuters prepares and provides summaries, metadata, or other related information concerning the original content. For example, reported cases in our legal products might include a headnote, key cite, and other metadata, as well as the full-text court case. In many cases, Thomson Reuters prepares the curation of the content. Any personal information contained in the curation is derived from personal information included in the original information content supplied by the source of that content.

**5\. Does Thomson Reuters edit or change the substances of the original information content?**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Except for clerical/typographical errors and format changes in compliance with editorial house styles and except as directed by source of the original information content, Thomson Reuters does not edit or change the substance of the original information content in most cases.

**6\. What if I want to change or delete my personal information contained in the information content or just want the informational content removed?**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In many cases, we are not the source of the information content and Thomson Reuters is not obliged to change or delete the substance of the original content including any personal information unless we receive a verified request from the source of the information content, such as, for example, a court order from the court that issued the court case in the first place.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding the substance of any informational content or your personal information as contained in that information content, please contact the source of the informational content and work with them directly to resolve your questions or concerns.
