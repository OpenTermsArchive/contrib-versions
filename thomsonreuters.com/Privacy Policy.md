We work to implement technical and organizational measures designed to protect the security of personal information.

This _Supplemental Privacy Statement for California Consumers under CCPA/CPRA_ (“_California Statement_”) supplements our [_Privacy Statement_](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html#privacy-statement) and further explains required disclosures about how we collect, disclose, and sell the personal information of California consumers and the rights that California consumers may have under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“_CCPA/CPRA_”) where we act as a business under CCPA/CPRA. When we use the term “_personal information_” in this California Statement, we are using that term as CCPA/CPRA defines it, which generally means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household. However, personal information does not include publicly available, deidentified, or aggregate consumer information (which are all defined in CCPA/CPRA). 

What categories of personal information do you collect and who do you share it with or sell it to?

In general, the categories of personal information we collect, sources of that information, business and commercial purposes for why we collect and use it, and who we share it with, as well as our personal information retention practices, are as outlined in our [_Privacy Statement_](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html#privacy-statement).

California law, however, requires we restate some of this information for specific categories that are defined in CCPA/CPRA. The type of personal information we collect and how we handle that personal information, including if we share or sell that personal information, depends on how you are specifically interacting with us and which Services you are inquiring about. In general, we have collected, disclosed for a business purpose, and sold the following categories of personal information and sensitive personal information from California consumers within the last twelve (12) months:

You may appeal an adverse decision on your requests [_by emailing or writing to us_](#ContactUs); and you have the right to lodge a complaint to the California Attorney General if you are not satisfied with our responses to your requests or how we manage your personal information.

**Cookie & IBA Statement**
--------------------------

This _Cookie & IBA Statement_ supplements our [_Privacy Statement_](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html#privacy-statement) and specifically explains how we and our third-party business partners deploy cookies and other tracking technologies (which we call “_Tracking Technologies_”), including for interest-based advertising (IBA), as well as the options you have to control them.

### _What are cookies and other tracking technologies?_

 “_Cookies_” are small pieces of data, stored in text files, that are stored on your browser, computer, or other device. The cookies we use may include “_flash cookies” (_or “_local shared objects”_) and “_HTML5 cookies_” that store information on your device (outside of your browser) and are specific to content supported by Adobe® Flash or HTML5. We and our third-party business partners may also use other tracking technologies such as “_web beacons_” (also known as “_tags_” and “_pixels_”) which are small images embedded in our Services, content, or emails, as well as “_embedded scripts_” which are pieces of code that are temporarily downloaded onto your device. These other tracking technologies are often used in conjunction with cookies, but may be stored on your device in a different manner from cookies so disabling cookies may not also disable these tracking technologies.

These Tracking Technologies may be operated and set by us (known as “_first party trackers_”) or by our third party business partners, such as social media networks, advertising networks, and content providers, (known as “_third party trackers_”); and can be set either for a single visit (through a “_session tracker_”) so they are deleted after that visit or remain on your device to persist for multiple repeat visits (through a “_persistent tracker_”).

### _Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?_

We use Tracking Technologies for several different purposes: these technologies are widely used to remember you and your preferences and understand how you interact with us so that we may perform essential functions (such as to provide our Services or deliver content and allow users to register and remain logged in), personalize our Services and content and ensure a quality, consistent, and efficient experience for our users, analyze your usage of our Services and interactions with content (including emails), and to deliver and measure advertising (including IBA).

### _How can you control the use of Tracking Technologies?_

You may wish to restrict the use of cookies or completely prevent them from being set. Most modern browsers allow you to change your cookie and other tracker settings, and you can usually find these settings in the options or preferences menu of your browser. Flash cookies can only be deleted within Adobe Flash rather than via your browser, and please refer to [_this Adobe help page_](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html) for information on how to manage Flash cookies. Additionally, you can opt-out of Google Analytics by installing [_Google’s opt-out browser add-on_](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)_._

You may also see a “cookie banner” on some of our Services, which allows you to manage our use of cookies and other Tracking Technologies – click on the banner for more information regarding which cookies are used on that particular Service and what you may disable, but please note that you cannot disable any Tracking Technologies that are categorized as strictly necessary.

Please be aware that some of the features of our Services may not function correctly if you disable all cookies or other technologies.

### _Do you honor Do Not Track Signals?_

Generally, we do not currently respond to, or take any action with respect to web browser “do not track” signals; however, in some instances, our third party business partners who integrate within our Services will honor do not track signals.

### _What is Interest-Based Advertising?_

“_Interest-based advertising_” (IBA) is also commonly referred to as “_targeted advertising_”, “_online behavioral advertising_”, and “_personalized advertising_”, and it generally means the delivery of personalized or targeted advertising to you that are tailored to your specific interests and demographics. IBA may also include analytics and reporting related to those advertisements (such as ad measurement and attribution, segmentation, and market research).

We may send you IBA based on the use of Tracking Technologies and other information you make available to us when you interact with our Services, our content, and our advertisements. We engage various third party business partners to serve you IBA and we may share with those third party business partners certain information about you and our Tracking Technologies to do so. Some of these third parties will deploy their own Tracking Technologies on our Services and content when doing so, in which they automatically receive your IP address, browser or device information, and other information from these Tracking Technologies. Some of our third party business partners (and their business partners) may also use or provide us with additional information about you that they have independently collected, from offline and online sources, to better target and provide you with more relevant and useful advertising. Some of these third parties may collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites. Please note that we do not control the privacy practices of these third parties, and their privacy practices are not covered by this Privacy Statement.

### _How can you opt-out of IBA?_

In addition to the above, you may also be able to choose not to receive IBA from participating companies that participate in either:

* The Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), in which you may opt-out of IBA using this [_DAA tool_](http://optout.aboutads.info/)_;_ and/or
    
* The Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), in which you may opt-out of IBA using this [_NAI Opt Out Tool_](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices) and, for those in the EU/EEA, [_this tool_](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/); and/or
    
* The [_AppChoices App_](http://youradchoices.com/appchoices) for opting out on mobile devices.
    

Certain mobile devices may have an advertising identifier that allows companies to serve IBA to a specific mobile device using that identifier. Depending on your specific device, you may be able to limit advertising, sharing of that advertising identifier, or reset the advertising identifier, as well as choose to turn off the device’s location tracking – including precise geolocation tracking – on your mobile device or for certain applications. See your device manufacturer to understand what options are available to you. For more details on your choices regarding use of your web browsing activity for IBA you may also visit the following sites: _[networkadvertising.org](http://networkadvertising.org/), [optout.aboutads.info](http://optout.aboutads.info/), [youradchoices.com](http://youradchoices.com/), and [youronlinechoices.eu](http://youronlinechoices.eu/)._

Next, some of our Services may also display _Do Not Sell My Personal Information_ or _Do Not Share My Personal Information_ links (or similarly named links), in which clicking those links may allow you to opt-out of the “sharing” or “selling” of your personal information as required by certain local privacy laws. Doing so may limit the manner in which we and our third party business partners may use your personal information in connection with IBA.

_**Please note that some of the options described above are browser-specific or device-specific, so you may need to opt-out again if you use a different device or change browsers. Please also note that, even if you opt-out of receiving IBA, you may still receive advertisements and marketing materials, but they may not be personalized to you specifically.**_

**Informational Content Privacy Statement**
-------------------------------------------

### _1\. Introduction_

As a global business information services company, we proudly distribute informational content within our Services. This _Informational Content Privacy Statement_ supplements the above [_Privacy Statement_](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html#privacy-statement) and further explains how we distribute and curate this informational content as part of our Services.

### _2\. Why does Thomson Reuters publish informational content?_

Thomson Reuters publishes various types of content, such as statutes, laws, regulations, rules, court cases, opinions, expert analysis, articles, forms, public records, treatise, dictionaries, and many other types of information, that we believe have professional and jurisprudential value for our customers or the general public.

### _3\. How does Thomson Reuters obtain informational content?_

Thomson Reuters obtains informational content in a number of ways – sometimes we purchase or license the content from others, sometimes we receive the content pursuant to a contract where we are required to curate and distribute the content, sometimes we commission the content ourselves, and sometimes the content is collected from a number of public sources, like public records, journalistic sources, and information in the public domain. Any personal information contained in informational content that is subsequently distributed by Thomson Reuters originates from the original text of the informational content.

### _4\. How does Thomson Reuters curate informational content?_

In addition to distributing the informational content, Thomson Reuters curates the content – in other words, Thomson Reuters prepares and provides summaries, metadata, or other related information concerning the original content. For example, reported cases in our legal products might include a headnote, key cite, and other metadata, as well as the original full-text court case. In many cases, Thomson Reuters prepares the curation of the content. Any personal information contained in the curation is derived from personal information included in the original information content supplied by the source of that content.

### _5\. Does Thomson Reuters edit or change the substances of the original information content?_

Except for clerical/typographical errors and format changes in compliance with editorial house styles and except as directed by source of the original information content, Thomson Reuters does not edit or change the substance of the original information content in most cases.

### _6\. What if I want to change or delete my personal information contained in the information content or just want the informational content removed?_

In many cases, we are not the source of the information content and Thomson Reuters is not obliged to change or delete the substance of the original content including any personal information unless we receive a verified request from the source of the information content, such as, for example, a court order from the court that issued the court case in the first place.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding the substance of any informational content or your personal information as contained in that information content, please contact the source of the informational content and work with them directly to resolve your questions or concerns.
