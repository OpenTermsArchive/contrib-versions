Guidelines Enforcement Process



November 2, 2021



Due to the particular risk posed by content that threatens or incites violence,

and to the sensitive nature of NSFW content, Parler uses a privacy-preserving

process involving both algorithmic filters and human review to address this

content. Should any threatening or inciting content be detected, it will be removed,

with an opportunity for appeal via our Parler Jury. (Note: this type of content has

always been a violation of our Guidelines.) Due to the fallible nature of AI,

violation points will be assigned only after appeals have been exhausted. If you

believe something you posted on Parler has been flagged in error, we encourage

you to submit an appeal, so that we may continue to improve this process. NSFW

content, if detected, will be placed behind the NSFW filter, and points assigned for

a user’s failure to designate this content in advance. Again, this automated

determination may be appealed, and we urge you to do so if you believe it was

made in error. (Note: the toggle to turn off the NSFW filter is accessible only on

Web (or Android), per Apple Guidelines.)



Finally, we have implemented a “trolling” filter, designed to detect personal

attacks based on immutable or otherwise irrelevant characteristics such as race,

sex, sexual orientation, or religion. This content often doesn’t contribute to a

productive conversation, and so we wanted to provide our users with a way to

minimize it in their feeds, should they choose to do so. Per Apple’s Guidelines for

iOS Apps, trolling content will not be viewable on Parler’s iOS App. However,

those wishing to view this content may do so on our Web or Android Apps, either

by clicking the individual “trolling” splash screen, or by turning off the splash

screens altogether. Those Web or Android users who wish to remove this content

from their feeds entirely may turn on the global filter. In the spirit of the First

Amendment, no violation points are assigned for this last type of content and,

again, any determination with respect to it may be appealed.



Appeals are reviewed by Parler employees, who provide feedback to those

involved in the initial determination process. The process for reviewing user-

generated reports—which may refer to violations of any of our Guidelines—is

similar, but these cases are first reviewed by our Parler Community Jury.
