Community Guidelines
2 / 14 /202 1
Our Guidelines govern your relationship with Parler, your use of Parler, as
well as  your  access to our services and products. By accessing Parler, you
agree to these terms. These Guidelines are designed to enable  productive ,
polite discourse among people with differing interests, life experiences, and
viewpoints.
Our goal is to provide all  community members with a welcoming,
n onpartisan  P ublic  S quare. While the First Amendment does not apply to
private companies  such as Parler, our mission is to create a social platform
in the  spirit of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.
We prefer that removing  users or user - provided  content  b e kept to the
absolute minimum. We prefer to leave decisions about what is seen and who
is heard to each  individual . In no case will  Parler decide what will content be
removed or filtered, or who se account will be removed, on the basis of the
opinion expre ssed within the content at issue. Parler ’s policies are , to use a
well - known concept in First Amendment law,  viewpoint - neutral .
We do not curate your feed; we do not pretend to be qualified to do so . We
believe only you are qualified to curate your  feed, and so we give you the
tools you need to do it yourself. To that end, Parler offers a number of
features — including the ability to mute or block other  users , or to mute or
block all comments  containing terms of  your choice — and we encourage you
to use  the se tools whenever the content you would rather not encounter here,
is not otherwise addressed by what follows.
At Parler, we’re committed to continuous improvement toward fulfilling our
mission . A ccordingly , these   G  uidelines are subject to modification ,
unilaterally by Parler, at any time .
Principle #1:
Parler will not knowingly allow itself to be used as a tool for crime, civil
torts, or other unlawful acts . We will remove reported user content that a
reasonable and objective observer would believe constitutes or evidences
such activity. We may also remove  the accounts of  users who use our
platform in this way .
Sometimes the law  properly  requires us to exclude content from our
platform o nce  it is reported  to us or to our Community Jury — content we

would make it a priority to exclude anyway . Obvious examples include :
child  sexual abuse material ,  content posted by or  on behalf of terrorist
organizations,  intellectual property theft.
However, even when the law may not require us to  flag or  remove reported
content, or to ban a  user , we  will nonetheless do so when we deem it
necessary  to prevent our services from being used by someone in the
commission of a  crime or civil tort — particularly when these are likely to
interfere with our mission of providing a welcoming, nonpartisan Public
Square. Examples include  criminal solicitation , fraud, and nuisance.
Finally, while Parler allows the posting of “Not Safe For Work”  and
“ trolling ” content, we  provide a double - filter system to  help  ensure this
content is  not viewed by those who  choose not to see it .
Principle #2:
Posting spam and using bots are nuisances and are not conducive to
productive and polite discourse. In addition, it is unjust to our Influencers
and creators , who have put time and effort into building their following an d
goodwill , and who deserve unfettered enjoyment of the effects of  their hard
work. The use of our mute and block features, by individual users, is often
adequate to address problems with spam. But whenever it is not, and
particularly when the behavior negatively affects the ability of those
participating in our Influence r Network to monetize themselves, Parler will
remove accounts of those who engage in this behavior.

principles is available here :  https://legal.parler.com/documents/Elaboration -
