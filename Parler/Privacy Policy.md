Parler Privacy Policy



Effective Date: April 14, 2022

Parler, Inc. and its affiliates (“Company,” “we,” “our,” and/or “us”) value the privacy of

individuals who use our social news applications, the websites where this Privacy Policy is posted

( “Websites”) , and related services (collectively, our “Services”). This privacy policy (the “Privacy

Policy”) explains how we collect, use, and share information from our users (“Users,” “you,”

and/or “your”) to facilitate your commenting, social news, and influencer networking experience.

By using our Services, you agree to the collection, use, disclosure, and procedures this Privacy

Policy describes. Beyond the Privacy Policy, your use of our Services is also subject to our Terms

of Service https://parler.com/documents/user-agreement.pdf



We neither sell your information to third parties nor share your information with foreign

governments except in the limited circumstances described in this Privacy Policy (see Section 2

“How We Share the Information We Collect” below for more detail).



We recognize that information privacy is an ongoing responsibility, and so we will from time to

time update this Privacy Policy as we undertake new privacy practices or adopt new privacy

policies.

1. Information We Collect

“Personal Information” is information that identifies, relates to, describes, or can be reasonably

linked to, directly or indirectly, a particular individual or household. We may collect Personal

Information (as we have done in the past) from you on or through the Services in a variety of ways,

including when you register on the Services, sign up for communications, or make any purchases.

We also may, from time to time, use Personal Information about you to improve the Services, and

for the various purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.



A. Information You Provide to Us.



Registration and Profile Information. When you sign up for an account or update your profile

information, we collect Personal Information you provide to us such as your name, email address,

phone number, display name, profile photo, preferred language, date of birth, and any Personal

Information you voluntarily provide in your profile biography, including gender and location.

Note: either an email address or phone number is required for registration purposes, and

both are recommended for account security and ease in recovery.



Verification Information. If you choose to go through a verification process, we may ask for

Personal Information that can be used to verify your identity, such as scans of your government-

issued photo identification. When your government-issued photo identification information is no

longer necessary to verify your identity, we delete the scans (front and back). We retain only an

anonymized hash corresponding to the information the identification document contains, to prevent

identity theft and impostor accounts. In addition to the identification information, we may ask for

you to take a selfie for the purpose of preventing impostor accounts. But they are deleted as soon

as they are reviewed as part of the verification process.

2



Influencer Network Information (Not Currently Available). Unlike other platforms, Parler

allows you to monetize your content, following, and goodwill. As part of that, the law requires us

to collect certain pieces of Personal Information. Specifically, in addition to identification

information (see above under “verification” for our collection and treatment of identifying

information), we collect form W-9 as required by the IRS. We are required to do this in order to

facilitate the receipt by you of payments earned on Parler. However, we store that Personal

Information in secure, encrypted form. We never share it, sell it, or use it in any way other than for

purposes of legal compliance.



Content you Share. We collect any information you choose to provide on our Services, such as

posts (“Parleys”), follows, photos, videos, gifs, comments, votes, and echoes.



Payment Information. If you make a purchase through our Services, your payment-related

Personal Information, such as your credit and debit card or automated clearing house (ACH)

information, is collected and stored by our third-party payment processor on our behalf.



Communications. If you contact us directly, we receive additional Personal Information about

you. For example, if you contact us for customer support, we may receive your name, email

address, phone number, the contents of any message or attachments you may send to us, and any

other information you choose to provide.



Your Contacts. If you permit us to access the address book on your device or give us permission

to import your contacts from an email account associated with your account, we may access and

store names and contact information, including Personal Information, from your address book, to

help you follow your contacts, and your contacts to follow you.



B. Information We Collect When You Use Our Services.



We may collect information that may not reasonably identify you or your household personally,

but is linked to your computer or device (“Device Identifiable Information”). We collect Device

Identifiable Information from you in the normal course of providing the Services. When you visit

our Services to browse, read, or download information, we automatically collect information about

your computer that your browser sends, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access

times, pages visited, and referring website addresses. We may use Device Identifiable Information

to analyze trends, help administer and improve the Services, to learn about and determine which

pages of the Websites visitors view and for how long, how visitors navigate throughout the

Services, and to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We may also collect

Device Identifiable Information through “cookies” or “web beacons” as explained below.



Device and Location Information. We receive Device Identifiable Information about the device

and software you use to access our Services, including IP address (from which approximate or

“coarse” location may be inferred), device type, web browser type, operating system version,

phone carrier and manufacturer, member agents, application installations, device identifiers,

mobile advertising identifiers, and push notification tokens.

3



Usage Information. We automatically receive Device Identifiable Information about your

interactions with our Services, such as the posts or other content you view, the searches you

conduct, the people you follow, and the dates and times of your visits.



Information from Cookies and Similar Technologies. We may collect information using

cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies. Cookies are small text files containing a string of

alphanumeric characters. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session

cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your

browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to our Services.



Cookies operate in the background and you can turn them off by adjusting your Web browser

settings, but doing so may make it difficult to use some of the features on the Websites or the

features may not be available to you. We may use cookies to make your Service experience easier

by, for example, remembering your preferences, or keeping track of your login name and password.



For more information on your choices regarding cookies, you can review the FTC’s guide to opting

out of online tracking for computers and mobile devices. Your browser may offer you a “Do Not

Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and

services that you do not want them to track your online activities. The Services do not currently

support Do Not Track requests.

2. How We Use the Information We Collect



We may use the Personal Information we collect:



• To fulfill or meet requirements inherent in the reason you provided the information. For

example, we use the information about who you follow on Parler to deliver you a feed of

Parleys from those accounts; we use the information you put into a Parley to display it to

those who follow you or users who echo your Parley, or who visit your profile on Parler;



• To create, customize, and secure your account for use of the Services;



• To provide, maintain, and improve our Services, including for testing, research, analysis

and product development;



• To personalize your experience on our Services, such as by providing tailored content and

recommendations;



• To understand and analyze how you use our Services and develop new products, services,

features, and/or functionality;



• To communicate with you, provide you with updates and other information relating to our

Services, provide information that you request, respond to comments and questions, and

otherwise provide customer support;



• For marketing and advertising purposes, such as developing and providing promotional and

advertising materials that may be relevant, valuable or otherwise of interest to you,

including providing you with targeted offers and ads through our Website, and via email

or text message (with your consent);

4



• To send you text messages and push notifications;



• To facilitate transactions, redemptions, and payments;



• To verify your identity and determine your eligibility to join our influencer network;



• To find and prevent fraud and respond to trust and safety issues;



• To evaluate or conduct a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or

other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of

bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which Personal Information held by us

about our consumers is among the assets transferred;



• To help maintain the safety, security, and integrity of our Website, products and services,

databases and other technology assets, and business;



• For compliance purposes, including enforcing our Terms of Service or other legal rights,

or as may be required by applicable laws and regulations or requested by any judicial

process, law enforcement or governmental agency; and



• For other purposes for which we provide specific notice at the time the information is

collected.



We will not collect additional categories of Personal Information or use the Personal Information

we collected for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without updating this

Privacy Policy to provide you with notice as set out in Section 10 “Changes to the Privacy

Policy” below.

3. How We Share the Information We Collect



Vendors and Service Providers. We may share any Personal Information we receive with vendors

and service providers retained in connection with the provision of our Services.



Content you Share. Our Services are social services which allow you to find, enjoy, and share

content. Your name, display name, profile photo, about me section, and contacts (i.e., members

you are following) will always be viewable and/or searchable by other Members. The content you

post to our Services will be displayed and viewable by other Members by default. Although this

content is public by default, in the “Your Choices” section below, we describe the account settings

and controls you can use to limit the sharing of certain information. We are not responsible for

other Members’ use of available information, so you should carefully consider whether and what

to post and how you identify yourself on our Services.



Marketing. We do not share Personal Information about you with nonaffiliated third parties for

their direct marketing purposes unless we have your affirmative express consent.



As Required By Law and Similar Disclosures. We may access, preserve, and disclose your

Personal Information if we believe doing so is required or appropriate to: (a) comply with law

enforcement requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; (b) respond to your

requests; or (c) protect your, our, or others’ rights, property, or safety. For the avoidance of doubt,

5



the disclosure of your Personal Information may occur if you post any objectionable content on or

through our Services.



Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers. We may transfer your Personal Information to service

providers, advisors, potential transactional partners, or other third parties in connection with the

consideration, negotiation, or completion of a corporate transaction in which we are acquired by

or merged with another company or we sell, liquidate, or transfer all or a portion of our assets. The

use of your Personal Information following any of these events will be governed by the provisions

of this Privacy Policy in effect at the time of the acquisition or merger.



Consent. We may also disclose your Personal Information with your permission.

4. Your Choices



Sharing Preferences. We provide you with settings to allow you to set your sharing preferences

for content you post to our Services. Certain Personal Information, such as your display name, may

always be publicly available to others, and other Personal Information is made publicly available

to others by default. To change whether certain information is publicly viewable, you can adjust

the settings in your account.



Marketing Communications. We send you marketing communications consistent with your

choices. You can unsubscribe from our promotional emails by adjusting your account settings or

via the link provided in the emails. Similarly, if you change your mind about receiving promotional

text messages after having opted-in, you may follow the opt-out directions sent with each text.



Note: Even if you opt-out of receiving promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive

administrative messages from us.



Notifications. You can opt-out of receiving notifications for posts, votes, echoes, comments, and

followers by adjusting your profile and/or operating system (i.e., iOS or Android) settings.



Correction. You may correct your Personal Information at any time by logging in to your account

and updating any inaccurate information.



Additional Privacy Rights. In addition, if you are a resident of California or of the European

Economic Area, you have additional rights with respect to your Personal Information. Please see

Sections 11 and 12 below for additional information.

5. Third Party Links and Sites



Our Services may contain links to other websites, products, or services that we do not own or

operate. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties. Please be aware that

this Privacy Policy does not apply to your activities on these third-party services or any information

you disclose to these third parties. We encourage you to read their privacy policies before providing

any information to them.



For example, any information you share with Google as a consequence of sharing or interacting

with YouTube content on Parler is governed by Google’s privacy policy. Google now provides

users some control over the collection of data by its users and API Clients like Parler; follow this

6



link for more information on revoking an API client’s access to your data. Exercising such control

may require having a Google account, which itself may be a privacy concern for some of our

members. Therefore, members are encouraged to use Parler’s own native video capabilities (or the

capabilities of other platforms equally respectful of member privacy) if they wish to avoid sharing

data with Google. (A similar disclaimer applies to Rumble, an emerging competitor of Google-

YouTube. When in doubt, consult the privacy policy of the entity responsible for facilitating the

display of content on our Services, before choosing to interact with it, so you can make an informed

decision about your privacy.)

6. Security



We make reasonable efforts to protect your Personal Information by using physical and electronic

safeguards designed to improve the security of the Personal Information we maintain. However,

no method of transmission or storage of data is 100% secure and we will not be responsible for

any damage that results from a security breach of data or the unauthorized access to or use of

information, whether Personal Information or Device Identifiable Information. To the extent we

provide your Personal Information to any third parties, we will request that they use reasonable

security measures to protect your information.

7. Children’s Data



We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or use Personal Information from children under 13 years

of age, and no part of our Services is directed to children. If you learn that a child has provided us

with Personal Information in violation of this Privacy Policy, then you may alert us at

privacy@parler.com and we will delete such information.

8. International Transfers of Data



Our Services are hosted in the United States and intended for visitors located within the United

States. If you choose to use our Services from the European Union or other regions of the world

with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, then please note that

you are transferring your Personal Information outside of those regions to the United States for

storage and processing. By providing any information, including Personal Information, on or to

our Services, you consent to such transfer, storage, and processing.

9. Update or Delete Your Information



You can update your account and profile information through your account settings. You can delete

your account by selecting that option via our online Parler Privacy Request portal, which is

accessible by clicking here.



10. Changes to the Privacy Policy



We will post any adjustments to the Privacy Policy on this page, and the revised version will be

effective when it is posted. If we materially change the ways in which we use or share Personal

Information previously collected from you through our Services, we will notify you through our

Services, by email, or other communication. Your continued use of our Services following our

posting or notifying you of changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes.

“How We Share the Information We Collect”.



A. Your Rights and Choices under the CCPA.



The CCPA provides consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their Personal

Information. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.



Right to Know and Data Portability



You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and

use of your Personal Information over the past 12 months (the “right to know”). Once we receive

10



your request and confirm your identity (see the “Exercising Your Rights to Know or Delete”

subsection below), we will disclose to you:

• The categories of Personal Information we collected about you.

• The categories of sources for the Personal Information we collected about you.

• Our business or commercial purpose for collecting that Personal Information.

• The categories of third parties with whom we share that Personal Information.

• If we disclosed your Personal Information for a business purpose, two separate lists

disclosing:



sales, identifying the Personal Information categories that each category of recipient

purchased; and



disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the Personal Information categories that

each category of recipient obtained.

• The specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you (also called a

“data portability request”).



Right to Delete



You have the right to request that we delete any of your Personal Information that we have collected

and retained, subject to certain exceptions (the “right to delete”). Once we receive your request and

confirm your identity (see “Exercising Your Rights to Know or Delete”), we will review your

request to see if an applicable exception allows us to retain the information. We may deny your

deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:



• Complete the transaction for which we collected the Personal Information, provide a good

or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our

ongoing business relationship with you, fulfill the terms of a written warranty or product

recall conducted in accordance with federal law, or otherwise perform our contract with

you

• Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal

activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.

• Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.

• Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech

rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.

• Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code §

1546 et. seq.).

• Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based

on your relationship with us.

• Comply with a legal obligation.

• Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the

context in which you provided it.



We will delete or deidentify Personal Information not subject to one of these exceptions from our

records and will direct our service providers to take similar action.

11



Exercising Your Rights to Know or Delete



To exercise your rights to know or delete described above, please submit a request via our online

Parler Privacy Request portal, which is accessible by clicking here.



Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a request to know or

delete related to your Personal Information by submitting proof of identity and, in the case of

someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, proof of their authority to act.



You may also make a request to know or delete on behalf of your child by providing proof of

identity.



You may submit a request to know only twice within a 12-month period. Your request to know or

delete must provide information sufficient for us to reasonably verify you are the person about

whom we collected Personal Information (or you are an authorized representative of same), as well

as describe your request with enough detail for us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to

it. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify

your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you.



You do not need to create an account with us to submit a request to know or delete. We will use

Personal Information provided in the request only to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to

make it.



For instructions on exercising your sale opt-out or opt-in rights, see “Personal Information Sales

Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights” below.



Response Timing and Format



We will confirm receipt of your request within ten (10) business days. If you do not receive

confirmation within the 10-day timeframe, please contact us at privacy@parler.com.



We endeavor to substantively respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days

of its receipt. If we require more time (up to another 45 days), we will inform you of the reason

and extension period in writing.



If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account, or to the email

address associated with the account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our

written response by mail or electronically, at your option.



Any disclosures we provide will cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request.

The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if

applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal

Information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity

to another entity without hindrance.



We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is

excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we

will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing

your request.

12



Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights



The CCPA prohibits a business from selling Personal Information unless you have received explicit

notice and an opportunity to opt out of further sales. We do not sell your Personal Information to

third parties. If this position changes and you are older than 16, you will be given explicit notice

and an opportunity to opt out of further sales, with details of how to exercise that “right to opt out”

listed in this policy.



We do not sell the Personal Information of any consumer, including consumers we actually know

are less than 16 years old, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the “right to opt in”) from

either the consumer who is between 13 and 15 years old, or the parent or guardian of a consumer

less than 13 years old. Consumers who opt in to Personal Information sales may opt out of future

sales at any time.



We will only use Personal Information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with

the request.



B. Non-Discrimination under the CCPA.



We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by

the CCPA, we will not:



• Deny you goods or services.



• Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through

granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.



• Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.



• Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a

different level or quality of goods or services.



However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in

different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will

reasonably relate to your Personal Information’s value and contain written terms that describe the

program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt-

in consent, which you may revoke at any time.



C. Other California Privacy Rights.



California’s “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code Section § 1798.83) permits users of our Website

who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of Personal

Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Not all information sharing is

covered by the “Shine The Light” requirements and only information on covered sharing may be

included in our response. To make such a request, please do so via our online Parler Privacy

Request portal, which is accessible by clicking here, or write to us at:
