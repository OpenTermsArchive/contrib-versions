Parler  Privacy Policy
Effective Date: Ju ly 1 6 , 2021
Parler,  LLC  and  its  affiliates  ( “ Company, ” “ we, ” “ our, ” and/or  “ us ” )  value  the  privacy  of
individuals who use our social news application s ,  the website s where this Privacy Policy is posted
(  “ Websites ” )  , and related services (collectively, our  “ Services ” ). This privacy policy (the  “ Privacy
Policy ” ) explains how we collect, use, and share information from our users ( “ Users, ” “ you, ”
and/or  “ your ” ) to facilitate  your commenting, social news, and influencer networking experience.
By using our Services, you agree to the collection, use, disclosure, and procedures this Privacy
Policy describes. Beyond the Privacy Policy, your use of our Services is also subject to ou r Terms
of Service  https://legal.parler.com/documents/termsofservice.pdf
We  neither  sell  your  information  to  third  parties  nor  share  your  information  with  foreign
governments except  in the limited circumstances described in this Privacy Policy (see  Section 2
“ How We Share the Information We Collect ” below for more detail).
We recognize that information privacy is an ongoing responsibility, and so we will from time to
time update this Privacy  Policy as we undertake new  privacy  practices or adopt new privacy
policies.
1. Information  We Collect
   “ Personal Information ” is informatio n that identifies, relates to, describes, or can be reasonably
   linked to, directly or indirectly, a particular individual or household. We may collect Personal
   Information (as we have done for the past twelve months) from you on or through the Services in
   a variety of ways, including when you register on the  Services , sign up for  communications, or
   make any purchases . We also may, from time to time,  use  Personal Information about you to
   improve the Services, and for the various purposes outlined in this Pri vacy Policy.
   A. Information You Provide to U s.
   Registration and Profile Information.  When you sign up for an account, we collect  Personal
   Information you provide to us  such as your name, email address, display name, profile photo ,
   preferred  language,  and  any  Personal  Information  you  voluntarily  provide  in  your  profile
   biography .
   Verification Information.  If you choose to go through the verification process, we may ask for
   Personal Information that can be used to verify your identity, such as  scans of your government -
   issued photo identification. When your government - issued photo identification information is no
   longer necessary to verify your identity, we delete the scans (front and back). We retain only an
   anonymized hash corresponding to the  information the identification document contains, in order
   to prevent identity theft and impostor accounts. In addition to the identification information, we
   may  ask for you to take a selfie for the purpose of preventing impostor accounts. But they are
   del eted as soon as they are reviewed as part of the verification process.
   Influencer Network Information.  Unlike other platforms, Parler allows you to monetize your
   content, following, and goodwill. As part of that, the law requires us to collect certain pieces of
   Personal Information . Specifically, in addition to identification information (see above under
   1

----- page 2 -----

“ v erification ” for our collection and treatment of identifying information), we collect form W - 9 as
required by the IRS. We are required to do this in order to facilitate the receipt by you of payments
earned on Parler. However, we store that  Personal Inform ation in secure, encrypted form. We never
share it, sell it, or use it in any way other than for purposes of legal compliance.
Content you Share.  We collect any information you choose to provide on our Services, such as
posts ( “ Parleys ” ) , follows, photos,  videos, gifs, comments, votes, and echoes.
Payment Information.  If you make a purchase through our Services, your payment - related
Personal Information , such as your credit and debit card or automated clearing house (ACH)
information, is collected and store d by our third - party payment processor on our behalf.
Communications . If you contact us directly, we receive additional  Personal Information about
you. For example, if you contact us for customer support, we may receive your name, email
address, phone  number, the contents of any message or attachments you may send to us, and any
other information you choose to provide.
Your Contacts . If you permit us to access the address book on your device or give us permission
to import your contacts from an email ac count associated with your account, we may access and
store names and contact information , including Personal Information, from your address book , to
help you follow your contacts, and your contacts to follow you.
B. Information We Collect When You Use Our Se rvices.
We may collect information that may not reasonably identify you or  your household personally,
but is linked to your computer or device ( “ Device Identifiable Information ” ). We collect Device
Identifiable Information from you in the normal course of providing the Services. When you visit
our Services to browse, read, or download information, we automatically collect information about
your computer that your browser sends, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access
times, pages visited , and referring website addresses. We may use Device Identifiable Information
to analyze trends, help administer  and improve  the Services, to learn about and determine  which
pages of the Websites visitors view and  for how long , how visitors navigate throughout the
Services, and to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We may also collect
Device Identifiable Information through  “ cookies ” or  “ web beacons ” as explained below.
Device and Location Information.  We r eceive  Device Identifiable Information about the device
and software you use to access our Services, including IP address (from which  approximate or
“coarse”  location may be inferred), device type, web browser type, operating system version,
phone carrier  and manufacturer,  member agents, application  installations, device  identifiers,
mobile advertising identifiers, and push notification tokens.
Usage  Information.  We  automatically  receive  Device  Identifiable  Information about  your
interactions with our Servi ces, such as the posts or other content you view, the searches you
conduct, the people you follow, and the dates and times of your visits.
Information  from  Cookies  and  Similar  Technologies.  We  may  collect  information  using
cookies, pixel tags, and similar  technologies. Cookies are small text files containing a string of
alphanumeric characters. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session

br owser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to our Services.
Cookies operate in the background and you can turn them off by adjusting your Web browser
settings, but doing so may make it difficult to use some of the features on the Websites o r the

For more information on your choices regarding  cookies, you can review the FTC ’ s guide to opting
out of online tracking for computers and mobile devices. Your browser may offer you a  “ Do Not

support Do Not Track requests .

content. Your name, display name, profile photo, about me section, and contacts (i.e., members you
are following) will always be viewable and/or searchable by other Members. The content you post
to our Services will be displayed and viewable by other Members by default. Although this content
is public by default, in the  “ Your Choices ” section below, we describe the a ccount settings and
controls you can use to limit the sharing of certain information. We are not responsible for other
Members ’ use of available information, so you should carefully consider whether and what to post

5\. Third Part y Links and Sites
Our Services may contain links to other websites, products, or services that we do not own or

that this Privacy Policy does not apply to your activities on these third - party services or any
information you disclose to these third parties. We encourage you to read their privacy policies
b efore providing any information to them.
For example, any information you share with Google as a consequence of sharing or interacting with
YouTube content on Parler is governed by Google ’ s privacy  policy. Google now provides users
some control over the collection of data by its users and API Clients like Parler; follow this link for
more information on revoking an API client ’ s access to your data. Exercising such control may
require having a Google account, which itself may be a privacy concern for some of our members .
Therefore, members are encouraged to use Parler ’ s own native video capabilities (or the capabilities
of other platforms equally respectful of member privacy) if they wish to avo id  s haring data with
Google. (A similar disclaimer applies to Rumble, an emer ging competitor of Google - YouTube.
When in doubt, consult the privacy policy of the entity responsible for facilitating the display of
content on our Services, before choosing to interact with it, so you can make an informed decision
about your privacy.)

safeguards designed to improve the security of the  Personal Information we maintain.  However,
no method of transmission or storage of data is 100% secu re and we will not be responsible for
any damage that results from a security breach of data or the unauthorized access to or use of
5

provide your Personal Inform ation to any third parties, we will request that they use reasonable
security measures to protect your information.
7\. Children ’ s Data

of age, and no part of our Services is directed to children. If you learn that a child has provided us

ongoing business relationship with you, fulfill the terms of a written warranty or product

written response by mail or electronically, at your option.
Any disclosure s we provide will cover the 12 - month period preceding our receipt of your request.
The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if

Information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity
to another entity without hindrance.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is

discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
• Provide yo u a different level or quality of goods or services.
• Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a

However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the  CCPA that  can result
in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA - permitted financial incentive we offer will
11

the program ’ s material aspects. Particip ation in a financial incentive program requires your prior
opt - in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
