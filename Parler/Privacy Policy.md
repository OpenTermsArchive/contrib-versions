individuals who use our social news application, website, and related services (collectively, our
“Services”). This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) explains how we collect, use, and share
information from  our  users (“ Users ,” “you,” and/or “your”) to facilitate your commenting, social
news, and influencer networking experience. By using our Services, you agree to the collection,
use, disclosure, and procedures thi s Privacy Policy describes. Beyond the Privacy Policy, your

Information We Collect
We may collect a variety of information from or about you or your devices from various sources,
as described below.\

Registration and Profile  Information. When you sign up for an account, we may collect
information such as your name, email address,  display name , and profile photo.\
Verification Information.  If you choose to go through the verification process,  we may ask for
information that can be used to verify your identity, such as scans of your government - issued
photo identification. When your government - issued photo identification information is no long er
necessary to verify your identity, we delete the scans (front and back). We retain only an
anonymized hash corresponding to the information the identification document contains, in order
to prevent identity theft and impostor accounts. No personally ide ntifiable information from your
identification document can be retrieved from the stored hash. In addition to the identification
information, we ask for you to take a selfie. We retain the selfie to prevent the creation of
impostor accounts, but we store t hem securely, in encrypted form.
Influencer Network Information. Unlike other platforms, Parler allows you to monetize your
content, following, and goodwill. As part of that, the law requires us to collect certain pieces of
personally identifiable informa tion. Specifically, in addition to identification information (see
above under “verification” for our collection and treatment of identifying information), we
