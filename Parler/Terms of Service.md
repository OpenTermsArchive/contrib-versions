You are responsible for your use of the Services and for any content that you post.

Parler does not endorse, support, represent, or affirm the completeness,

truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any of the content posted through the

Parler does not take responsibility for such content.

4.6 With respect to any content you contribute that uses YouTube services via Parler,

you affirm that—in addition to complying with Parler's own Terms and Community

Guidelines—you are also complying with YouTube's more restrictive Terms. (Users

avoid the application of these more restrictive terms.)



5. Right to Distribute. You grant to Parler a license to any content posted by you to the

Services, including a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to

sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display

and distribute your content. You agree that Parler or its service providers or partners

may display advertising in connection with your content and otherwise monetize your

You warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant these rights to Parler and

other members of the Parler community. You also grant a limited non-exclusive,

royalty-free license to any Parler community member to use, copy, reproduce, process,

adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display, and distribute any content posted by you

licenses granted by you hereunder do not include any moral rights or right of

attribution.



6. Virtual Items. You understand that at times you may earn buy or purchase virtual

tokens for use in the Services (Virtual Items). You agree and acknowledge that you do

not in fact own the Virtual Items and the amounts of any Virtual Item do not refer to

any credit balance of real currency or its equivalent. Rather, you may purchase or

earn a limited right to exchange Virtual Items for a limited license to use certain

features of the Services. Any virtual token balance shown in your account does not

constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a

measurement of the extent of your ability to procure such limited license to use certain

features made available via the Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, from time to

time Parler may make available a feature where Virtual Items may be redeemed for

cash. Parler prohibits and does not recognize any purported transfers of Virtual Items

effectuated outside of the Services, or the purported sale, gift, or trade in the real

world of anything that appears or originates in the Services, unless otherwise

expressly authorized by Parler in writing. Accordingly, you may not sublicense, trade,

sell, or attempt to sell Virtual Items for real money, or exchange Virtual Items for value

3



of any kind outside of the Services, without Parler’s written permission. Any such

transfer or attempted transfer is prohibited and void and will subject your account to

termination. You are responsible for all taxes arising out of your use of the Services,

including without limitation any taxes due upon your redemption of the Virtual Items

for cash. If you redeem Virtual Items for cash, you may be required to supply a social

security number and/or tax identification number prior to the issuance of the cash

redemption to you. Parler may file an IRS form 1099 or similar form with the Internal

Revenue Service or the appropriate tax filing with a governmental entity for the fair

market value of any cash redemptions issued to you in exchange for the Virtual items.



7. Copyright infringement is not allowed on the Services, and Parler will, in

appropriate circumstances, terminate the account of any repeat infringer. If your

copyright has been infringed by any content on the Services and you did not grant a

license for this use by uploading your copyrighted work to the Services, you may

submit a notice that meets all of the requirements of the Digital Millennium Copyright

Act (DMCA), 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3), to our Copyright Manager at abuse@parler.com or

209 S. Stephanie St., B212, Henderson, NV 89012. Your notice must include: (1)

electronic or physical signature of the copyrighted work owner (or person authorized

by the copyright owner), (2) a description of the copyrighted work, including the URL

where the infringing content is available, or a copy of it, (3) contact details of the

person submitting the notice, including email address, telephone, and mailing

address, (4) statement in “good faith belief” that the work is not authorized by the

copyright owner, and (5) a statement by the sender that all of the above information

is accurate, and that the person sending the notice is either the copyright owner or is

authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner. Upon receiving a notice satisfying

these requirements, Parler will take whatever action, in its sole discretion, it deems

appropriate, including removal of the challenged content from the services.



8. You may not interfere with the Services in any way, such as by accessing the

Services through automated means in a manner that puts excessive demand on the

Services; by hacking the Services; by accessing without authorization areas of the

Services that are protected by technical measures designed to prevent unauthorized

Services; by accessing the Services for any purpose that competes with the interests

9. Parler may remove any content and terminate your access to the Services at any

time and for any reason to the extent Parler reasonably believes (a) you have violated

these Terms or Parler’s Community Guidelines, (b) you create risk or possible legal

exposure for Parler, or (c) you are otherwise engaging in unlawful conduct—although

Parler endeavors to allow all free speech that is lawful and does not infringe the legal

rights of others. Any invitation made by Parler to you to use the Services or submit

4



content to the Services, or the fact that Parler may receive a benefit from your use of

the Services or provision of content to the Services, will not obligate Parler to maintain

any content or maintain your access to the Services. Parler will have no liability to you

for removing any content, for terminating your access to the Services, or for modifying

or terminating the Services. In addition, accounts which are inactive (without login)

for nine (9) months are subject to username relinquishment or account removal.



10. You agree to receive communications from Parler, including communications sent

IN THESE TERMS IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.



12. Applicable law and dispute resolution procedure.



(a) The laws of Washington, DC will govern these Terms and any dispute that arises

between you and Parler. You agree that all disputes related to these Terms or the

Services will first be mediated, in good faith, within sixty (60) days of the demanding

party’s provision of a written demand, unless expressly agreed otherwise in a signed

writing. In the event that a full settlement is not achieved during mediation, you

agree that any dispute, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or

based on any right arising out of these Terms or otherwise, shall then be settled

exclusively by arbitration as set forth hereunder and you hereby waive the right to

a jury trial before any court of competent jurisdiction.

(b) Jury Trial Waiver. IN USING THE SERVICES, YOU THEREBY WAIVE A TRIAL BY

JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, OR COUNTER-CLAIM BROUGHT OR

ASSERTED BY EITHER YOU OR PARLER AGAINST THE OTHER ON ANY MATTERS

WHATSOEVER RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF THE FORMATION OF AN

AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES BASED ON THESE TERMS.

(c) Requirement. All claims, controversies, disputes and other matters in question

arising out of, or relating to these Terms, the breach hereof or the rights, privileges,

responsibilities or duties between or among you and Parler, shall be decided by

confidential arbitration in Washington, DC, USA in accordance with the

Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then

existing, unless all parties to any such claim, controversy or dispute, or other

matter in question, unanimously agree to the contrary. The provisions contained in

this Paragraph shall be specifically enforceable under the prevailing arbitration law.

(d) Procedure. The arbitrator or arbitrators for any proceeding conducted hereunder

shall be a person or persons with experience in the social media business, selected

in accordance with the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect. The

parties will be entitled to conduct discovery in accordance with the provisions of

Washington, DC’s applicable code of civil procedure. The remedial authority of the

arbitrator or arbitrators will be the same as, but no greater than, would be the

remedial power of a court having jurisdiction over the Parties and their dispute. The

7



arbitrator or arbitrators will render a written opinion based on Washington, DC law,

and specifying an award, which will be final and binding upon the Parties.



13. You affirm that you are competent to agree to be bound by this Agreement,

meaning that you are over the age of 18 and, if applicable, have the consent of any

designated guardian. Guardians should be aware that, in addition to the NSFW filters

on the market, which can help you tailor your child’s experience on our platform. Some

examples can be found here and here.



14. Parler cannot waive any right to enforce this Agreement, unless it does so expressly

in writing. No waiver of any part of this Agreement, will be a further or continuing

waiver of that part or any other part, and no failure to enforce any part of this

Agreement will be deemed a waiver of any kind.



15. Parler may modify the Terms of this Agreement in any way and at any time without

notice to you, and you agree to be responsible for making yourself aware of any

modification of the Terms and to be bound by any modification of the Terms when you

continue to access or use the Services after any such modification. As a matter of

courtesy, Parler endeavors to inform its community members of any such changes.

These Terms supersede all prior agreements between you and Parler pertaining to the

Services. Except for the statements in this document and the documents expressly

incorporated herein by reference, no statement by Parler or anyone associated with

Parler, whether verbal or written, can modify or supplement the Terms of this

Agreement unless the modification or supplement is stated expressly in writing by

referring to this Agreement. If any of the Terms in the Agreement are held to be invalid

or unenforceable by a court or arbitrator or by operation of law, the remaining Terms

will remain in effect.
