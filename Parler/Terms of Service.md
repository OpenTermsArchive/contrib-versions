4.5 The content complies with the Parler Community Guidelines.   You are responsible for your use of the Services and for any content that you post. Parler   does   not   endorse,   support,   represent,   or   affirm   the   completeness, truthfulness,  accuracy,  or  reliability  of  any  of  the  content  posted  through the Services, nor does Parler endorse any opinions expressed through the Services. All content  is  the  sole  responsibility  of  the  person  who  originated  the  content,  and Parler does not take responsibility for such content.  4.6 With respect to any content you contribute that uses YouTube services via Parler, you affirm that—in addition to complying with Parler's own Terms and Community Guidelines—you are also complying with YouTube's more restrictive Terms. (Users are encouraged to use Parler's own native video capabilities whenever they wish to avoid the application of these more restrictive terms.)       

5. Right to Distribute. You grant to Parler a license to any content posted by you to the Services, including a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display and distribute your content. You agree that Parler or its service providers or partners may display advertising in connection with your content and otherwise monetize your content without compensation to you, unless you are a participant in our Influencer Network and then you will be compensated according to the terms of that program. You  warrant  that  you  have  all  rights  necessary  to  grant  these  rights  to  Parler  and other  members  of  the  Parler  community.  You  also  grant  a  limited  non-exclusive, royalty-free license to any Parler community member to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display, and distribute any content posted by you to the Services solely in connection with that member’s use of the Services. The licenses  granted by  you  hereunder  do  not  include  any  moral  rights  or  right  of attribution.      

6. Virtual Items. You understand that at times you may earn buy or purchase virtual tokens for use in the Services (Virtual Items). You agree and acknowledge that you do not in fact own the Virtual Items and the amounts of any Virtual Item do not refer to any  credit  balance of  real  currency  or  its  equivalent.  Rather,  you may  purchase  or earn  a  limited  right  to  exchange  Virtual  Items  for  a  limited  license  to  use  certain features of the Services. Any virtual token balance shown in your account does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of your ability to procure such limited license to use certain features made available via the Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, from time to time Parler may make available a feature where Virtual Items may be redeemed for cash. Parler prohibits and does not recognize any purported transfers of Virtual Items effectuated  outside  of  the  Services,  or  the  purported  sale,  gift,  or  trade  in  the  real world  of  anything  that  appears  or  originates  in  the  Services,  unless  otherwise expressly authorized by Parler in writing. Accordingly, you may not sublicense, trade, sell, or attempt to sell Virtual Items for real money, or exchange Virtual Items for value

If you redeem Virtual Items for cash, you may be required to supply a social security number and/or tax identification number prior to the issuance of the cash redemption to you. Parler may file an IRS form 1099 or similar form with the Internal Revenue Service or the appropriate tax filing with a governmental entity for the fair market value of any cash redemptions issued to you in exchange for the Virtual items.  

7. Copyright  infringement  is  not  allowed  on  the  Services,  and  Parler  will,  in appropriate  circumstances,  terminate  the  account  of  any  repeat  infringer.  If  your copyright has been infringed by any content on the Services and you did not grant a license  for  this  use  by  uploading  your  copyrighted  work  to  the  Services,  you  may submit a notice that meets all of the requirements of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act  (DMCA),  17  U.S.C  512(c)(3), to  our  Copyright  Manager  at abuse@parler.com or 209  S.

9. Parler may remove any content and terminate your access to the Services at any time and for any reason to the extent Parler reasonably believes (a) you have violated these Terms or Parler’s Community Guidelines, (b) you create risk or possible legal exposure for Parler, or (c) you are otherwise engaging in unlawful conduct—although Parler endeavors to allow all free speech that is lawful and does not infringe the legal rights of others. Any invitation made by Parler to you to use the Services or submit

content to the Services, or the fact that Parler may receive a benefit from your use of the Services or provision of content to the Services, will not obligate Parler to maintain any content or maintain your access to the Services. Parler will have no liability to you for removing any content, for terminating your access to the Services, or for modifying or terminating the Services. In addition, accounts which are inactive (without login) for nine (9) months are subject to username relinquishment or account removal.

Parler has no responsibility or liability to you arising from your use of the Services. Parler has no  responsibility  or  liability  to  you  arising  from  content  provided  by  you  or  any other  person,  even  if  such  content  is  untrue,  harmful,  damaging,  offensive, inappropriate,  fraudulent,  tortious,  unlawful,  contrary  to  social  norms,  etc. Although Parler may make efforts to review or monitor content, you agree that you will not rely on this fact for any purpose. Parler has no responsibility or liability to you  arising  from  hacking  event,  data  breach,  theft,  misuse  of  information, conspiracy,  racket,  fraud,  act  of  terrorism,  misappropriation  of  information, technical malfunction, interruption of service, or similar event that may cause you to suffer damage, loss, or injury, including without limitation any damage to or loss of  your  personal  property,  data,  operations,  information,  reputation,  goodwill, profits, etc.   

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND REGARD-    LESS OF THE NATURE OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION, PARLER WILL NOT BE   LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, WHETHER  INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR FOR INTANGIBLE LOSSES, ARISING FROM (a) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF (OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE) THE SERVICES; (b) FROM THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF ANY OTHER PERSON

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF PARLER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICES EXCEED  THE  GREATER  OF  TWO  HUNDRED  U.S.  DOLLARS  (U.S.  $200.00)  OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID PARLER, IF ANY, IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM. THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SECTION  SHALL APPLY TO ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY,  CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, AND SHALL FURTHER APPLY WHETHER OR NOT PARLER HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBLITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGES AND EVEN IF A REMEDY LAID OUT IN THESE TERMS IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.        

 

 

 

12. Applicable law and dispute resolution procedure.  

(a) The laws of Washington, DC will govern these Terms and any dispute that arises between you and Parler. You agree that all disputes related to these Terms or the Services will first be mediated, in good faith, within sixty (60) days of the demanding party’s provision of a written demand, unless expressly agreed otherwise in a signed writing. In the event that a full settlement is not achieved during mediation, you agree that any dispute, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any right arising out of these Terms or otherwise, shall then be settled exclusively by arbitration as set forth hereunder and you hereby waive the right to a jury trial before any court of competent jurisdiction. (b) Jury Trial Waiver. IN USING THE SERVICES, YOU THEREBY WAIVE A TRIAL BY JURY  IN  ANY  ACTION,  PROCEEDING,  OR  COUNTER-CLAIM  BROUGHT  OR ASSERTED BY EITHER YOU OR PARLER AGAINST THE OTHER ON ANY MATTERS WHATSOEVER  RELATING  TO  OR  ARISING  OUT  OF  THE  FORMATION  OF  AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES BASED ON THESE TERMS. (c) Requirement.  All  claims,  controversies,  disputes  and  other  matters  in  question arising out of, or relating to these Terms, the breach hereof or the rights, privileges, responsibilities  or  duties  between  or  among  you  and  Parler,  shall  be  decided  by confidential   arbitration   in   Washington,   DC,   USA   in   accordance   with   the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then existing,  unless  all  parties  to  any  such  claim,  controversy  or  dispute, or  other matter in question, unanimously agree to the contrary. The provisions contained in this Paragraph shall be specifically enforceable under the prevailing arbitration law. (d) Procedure.  The  arbitrator  or  arbitrators  for  any proceeding  conducted  hereunder shall be a person or persons with experience in the social media business, selected

in accordance with the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect. The parties will be entitled to conduct discovery in accordance with the provisions of Washington, DC’s applicable code of civil procedure. The remedial authority of the arbitrator  or  arbitrators  will  be  the  same  as,  but  no  greater  than,  would  be  the remedial power of a court having jurisdiction over the Parties and their dispute. The arbitrator or arbitrators will render a written opinion based on Washington, DC law, and specifying an  award,  which  will  be  final  and  binding  upon  the  Parties.  

 

13. You  affirm  that  you  are  competent to  agree  to  be  bound  by  this  Agreement, meaning  that  you  are over  the  age  of  18 and,  if  applicable,  have  the  consent of  any designated guardian. Guardians should be aware that, in addition to the NSFW filters made available by Parler, there are “Parental Control” products and features available on the market, which can help you tailor your child’s experience on our platform. Some examples can be found here and here.  

14. Parler cannot waive any right to enforce this Agreement, unless it does so expressly in  writing.  No  waiver  of  any  part  of  this  Agreement,  will  be  a  further  or  continuing waiver  of  that  part  or  any  other  part,  and  no  failure  to  enforce  any  part  of  this Agreement will be deemed a waiver of any kind.   

15. Parler may modify the Terms of this Agreement in any way and at any time without notice  to  you,  and  you  agree  to  be  responsible  for  making  yourself  aware  of  any modification of the Terms and to be bound by any modification of the Terms when you continue  to  access  or  use  the  Services  after  any  such  modification.  As  a  matter  of courtesy,  Parler  endeavors  to  inform  its  community  members  of  any  such  changes. These Terms supersede all prior agreements between you and Parler pertaining to the  Services. Except for the statements in this document and the documents expressly incorporated herein by reference, no statement by Parler or anyone associated with Parler, whether verbal or written, can modify or supplement the Terms of this Agreement unless the modification or supplement is stated expressly in writing by referring to this Agreement. If any of the Terms in the Agreement are held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court or arbitrator or by operation of law, the remaining Terms will remain in effect.
