Privacy Policy
==============

**Last Updated and Effective: April 1, 2021**

This privacy policy ("**Privacy Policy**") applies only to the information collected by Sony Corporation of America (“**Sony**”) through certain subpages of Sony.com ([www.sony.com](http://www.sony.com/)) (“**Website**”) and any other websites, webpages and other online offerings that post a link to this Privacy Policy, whether accessed via computer, mobile device or other technology. The websites and properties of affiliated Sony companies, including some that are linked to/from the Website, may have different privacy policies; therefore, please review the privacy policy notices on those websites or properties if you visit them.

This Privacy Policy explains the information that Sony may collect when you interact with us through the Website and our practices with respect to that information. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. In addition, please review the applicable [Terms and Conditions](https://www.sony.com/en_us/SCA/terms.html), which govern your use of the Website.

Collection of Information

We do not require you to provide personal information or register to visit the Website. However, whenever you visit or interact with the Website, Sony, as well as any third-party analytics providers or other service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the Website is accessed and used ("**Usage Information**"). Usage Information may include, without limitation, browser type, operating system, the page served, time on the Website, and the preceding page views. Usage Information is treated as personal information where required by law.

The Website is open only to individuals who are 16 years of age and older. We do not knowingly seek or collect information from persons younger than 16 years of age. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected information, including Usage Information, from a person younger than 16 years of age through the Website, we will take reasonable measures to delete such information from our records.

**Information Sony Collects Automatically**

Sony may also automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifiers ("**Device Identifiers**") for the computer, mobile device, technology or other device (collectively, "**Devices**") you use to access the Website. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a property or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third-party service providers with information regarding the physical location of the Device used to access the Website.

The technologies used on the Website to collect Usage Information, including Device Identifiers, may include:

 **Cookies.**  "Cookies" (which may be HTML files, Flash files or other technology) are small text files that help store user preferences and activity.  Cookies are placed on a Device when that Device is used to access or visit the Website. Cookies may be used for many purposes, such as remembering you and your preferences, tracking your visits to our Website and customizing your experience on the Website. You may configure your browser or Device to block the use of certain Cookies. However, please note that if you choose to disable Cookies on your Device, some features of our Website may not function properly.

 **Web Beacons**.  “Web Beacons” (also known as image tags, pixel tags, clear GIFs or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect advertising data, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses. Web Beacons or similar technologies may be used for various purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Website and to monitor how users navigate the Website.

 **Embedded Scripts.** An Embedded Script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Website, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Website, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.

Please note that third parties may collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you visit or use the Website. For example, some third parties' embedded content or plugins on the Website, such as social media sharing tools, allow their operators to learn that you have visited or interacted with the Website, and they may combine this information with other identifiable information they have collected about your visits to other websites or online services. These third parties may handle this information, and other information they directly collect through their content and plugins, pursuant to their own privacy policies.

**Online Tracking.** Some web browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” feature that signals to websites that you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked.  How browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet uniform. For this reason, the Website does not respond to such signals, except where required by law.

**Ad Serving and Traffic Measurement Services We May Use** 

Sony may use third party network advertisers to serve advertisements on the Website and third-party analytics service providers to evaluate and provide us with information about the use of the Website and viewing of our content. We do not share the information that you provide to Sony with these third parties, but ad network providers, the advertisers, the sponsors, and/or analytics service providers may set and access their own cookies, web beacons and embedded scripts on your Device from our Website. These cookies, web beacons, and embedded scripts may collect personal information or other information about your use of the Website over time and other third-party websites or applications and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you, including Usage Information. Cookies and web beacons, including those set by third party network advertisers, may be used to, among other things, target advertisements, prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times, or conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you.

**Social Media Applications**

Functionality on the Website may permit interactions between the Website and third-party properties, such as Facebook and Twitter. Such functionality enables you to “like” a product or online content, “share” content to other properties, and otherwise link the Website with another third-party property. If you choose to “like” or “share” content or to otherwise post information from or via the Website to a third-party property, that information may become public and the third-party property may have access to information about you and your use of the Website.

You may also choose to participate in a third-party application or feature (such as Facebook applications or a similar application or feature on a third-party property, or otherwise linking the Website with another property) through which you allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including personal information. When you choose to participate, you may be opting to link your activity on our Website with that third-party property, which may then collect information about your visits to our Website and may publish that activity as you request to your "profile" or similar feature with that third party (such as if you choose to share content you find on or Website with your "connections" on the third party's property). The information we collect is subject to this Privacy Policy. However, the information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third party's privacy practices, including whether the third party continues to share information with us or with other third parties, the types of information shared, and your choices regarding what is visible to others on that third party's property. The third party may allow you to remove an application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the information previously collected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**Third-Party Content, Links to Other Properties and Services, and Sony Content on Other Websites** 

Certain content on the Website may be hosted and served by third parties, which may include third-party widgets (such as those that allow you to "like" or "share" content with third-party websites and interactive services or to provide ratings and reviews). In addition, when you are on the Website you may be directed to other websites that are operated and controlled by third parties that are beyond our control. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use our logo(s) as part of a co-branding agreement. In addition, Sony content and widgets may be included on web pages and websites that are not associated with us and over which we have no control. These other websites may send their own Cookies to your Device, and they may independently collect data or solicit personal information. Sony is not responsible for the privacy practices of any third party.
