Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

### Why was Optimize sunsetted?

We remain committed to enabling businesses of all sizes to improve your user experiences and are investing in third-party A/B testing integrations for Google Analytics 4. We are focused on bringing the most effective solutions and integrations to our customers, especially as we look toward the future with Google Analytics 4.

Optimize, though a longstanding product, did not have many of the features and services that our customers request and need for experimentation testing. We therefore have decided to invest in solutions that will be more effective for our customers.

### What will testing in Google Analytics look like moving forward?

We are collaborating on integrations with the following A/B testing providers (listed in alphabetical order):

* AB Tasty
* Optimizely
* VWO

We have made our APIs publicly available so anyone can integrate their A/B testing tool with Google Analytics. [Learn more about the integration](https://support.google.com/optimize/answer/12979533?)

### What will happen to Firebase A/B Testing?

[Firebase A/B Testing](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ab-testing?) helps you optimize your app experiences by making it easy to run, analyze, and scale product and marketing experiments. While we acknowledge that Firebase uses the Google Optimize infrastructure for inference computation, Google is committed to continuing to support and evolve Firebase A/B Testing in the future. Firebase A/B Testing will not be impacted by the Google Optimize sunset.
