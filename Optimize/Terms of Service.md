In addition to the rights granted in these Optimize Terms and subject to Company's settings in the Optimize Service and Platform Home user interfaces (if any and as applicable), Company grants to Google a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, transferable, royalty free right to use, copy, modify, distribute and display Customer Data and Shared GA Data not directly identifiable with Company and derivatives thereof for the improvement of the Optimize Service, provided that Customer Data and Shared GA Data is not shared with any third parties without Company's consent. Subject to these Optimize Terms and Company's settings in the Optimize and Platform Home user interfaces (if any and as applicable), Google will not otherwise use Company's Google Analytics Customer Data (as defined in GA Terms) other than as permitted in Company's Google Analytics account settings.

**Section 5. Miscellaneous**

Google may collect information regarding how the Optimize Service is used, including how and what code is deployed. Subject to Company's settings in the Optimize Service and Platform Home user interface (if any and as applicable), Google may use this data to provide, improve, maintain, protect and develop the Optimize Service and other Google services as described in our [privacy policy](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/). Some Optimize Service features are identified as "Alpha," "Beta," "Experiment," or as otherwise unsupported or confidential (collectively, "**Beta Features**").
