And now, we’ve evolved into a tool that empowers users to connect with confidence.

When we talk about Bumble Group, we refer to Bumble Holding Limited, Badoo Trading Limited and Bumble Trading LLC (also known simply as “Bumble”, “we”, “us”, or “our” in this policy). This Policy explains how we process your personal information. It applies any time you’re using the Bumble mobile application or desktop version (“App”), and to your use of our “Sites”, which includes our websites like [Bumble.com](https://bumble.com/), microsites, and other digital products and services, like our competitions or surveys. We also suggest you read our [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://bumble.com/terms).

Have any questions about this Policy?  
Just [Contact Us](#contact-us--our-contact-information) and we’ll be happy to help.

Here at Bumble, we pride ourselves on taking all appropriate and reasonable security measures to:

*   help protect your information against loss, misuse, and unauthorised access or sharing
*   protect the confidentiality of your personal information, such as by using secured servers with firewalls

**Facebook:** If you choose to register or sign in using your Facebook account, you give Facebook permission to share your name and profile picture with us. And, unless you choose to opt-out of sharing these details, you also give Facebook permission to share your:

*   email address (if there is one associated with your Facebook account)
*   date of birth
*   other profile photos
*   gender
*   pages you like
*   current town or city

**Apple ID:** If you choose to register or sign in with your Apple ID, you give Apple permission to share with us:

*   your Apple login
*   a name (which you can edit)
*   an email that will be linked to your Bumble account and used to retrieve it

You can link your Bumble account with your Instagram, Facebook, or Spotify accounts. This allows you to share some information from those accounts directly to Bumble, like your Instagram photos or top Spotify artists.

You decide with Instagram/Facebook/Spotify what limited information we receive when you first link these accounts to your Bumble account.

If you want to disconnect any linked social media accounts from Bumble, just visit your settings in Instagram, Facebook, or Spotify and follow the instructions to remove the Bumble App access permissions.

We want to ensure the safety and security of everyone on our App and Sites, and give people the best possible user experience. To do this, we require every person using our App and Sites to verify their accounts.

This means we might ask for your phone number and, in some cases, ask that you carry out a photo verification or ID verification. This allows us to make sure the people on Bumble are actually people, that are of age, avoid fake accounts that can be used for malicious activities and cybercrime, and prevent fraud – all of which can threaten the Bumble network and spoil things for everyone.

You can also choose to (i) verify your photo voluntarily, which will allow you to add a grey “verified” badge to your profile, and (ii) verify your identity with your ID document, which will allow you to add a blue “verified” badge to your profile. If you choose to verify your profile photo, we will scan each photo that you submit. This scan can include the use of facial recognition technology to compare the submitted photo(s) to your profile photo, which helps us make sure you are who you say you are. If you choose to also verify your ID, our third party partner called Veriff will carry out the ID check on our behalf. Veriff will compare a selfie you take to your ID document. This scan can include the use of facial recognition technology, but you also have the option to request a manual review if you do not want facial recognition technology to be used.

When you choose to verify your photo, we do not add verification photos to your profile, but we do keep the scans to verify you in the future and for our records. We will only keep the scans as long as we need them for these purposes, but never longer than 3 years after your last interaction with us. Once we no longer need the scans or the 3 years have passed, we will take reasonable business steps to permanently and securely delete the scans from our systems. When you choose to also verify your ID, your selfie and your ID are compared by our third party partner, Veriff. Veriff will retain your selfie and the picture of your ID for up to 72 hours. You can read more about Veriff’s privacy practices [here](https://www.veriff.com/privacy-notice). For members in South Korea: Bumble does not collect any government-issued identity documents for identity verification processes, including any national ID numbers, driver’s license numbers, alien registration numbers, or passport numbers.

If you decide to purchase any of our premium services, we will process your payment information and securely keep it for audit/tax purposes and to prevent fraud.

To prevent fraudulent payments from being processed, we use automated decisions and our systems check payment information and transactions for behaviour that might violate our [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://bumble.com/terms). We may automatically block any transaction that is likely to be fraudulent and meets the relevant criteria suggesting a violation. If a transaction is blocked, the relevant person will be notified that their transaction cannot be processed and can [contact us](#contact-us--our-contact-information) to contest the decision.

You can always turn off geolocation if you ever change your mind about giving Bumble access to your location by:

*   iPhone — go to settings > security and privacy > location services > Bumble
*   Android — go to settings > location > Bumble > permissions > location

If you give Bumble access to your location in your device settings, we will collect information about your location when you use your mobile device. We do this to personalise your App experience and make it easier for you to make connections and interact with others.

This can include information about WiFi access points and your longitude/latitude, and we can save your device’s coordinates to offer certain features to you.

For example, by enabling your general location information to appear to people seeing your profile and show you the profiles of people who are near you.

When you use the App, we can collect information about your device for the purposes described in this Policy. This can include your device’s unique identifier, model, and operating system, as well as log and usage data. You can also choose to give our App access to your device’s address book, which will only be used when you want to add someone to your contacts.

We want to help you put your best foot forward, so we collect data about your profile photos that allows us to arrange them in a way that is favourable to you. This includes data such as which photos people spend the most time looking at or which have the best lighting, etc. You can opt-out of this feature through our app settings at any time.

You might come across some links while using our App or Sites. If you use them, we can keep track of how you interact with links, including to third-party services that we are not responsible for, by monitoring redirecting clicks or other methods.

We review the content of messages sent in the App to identify topics, sentiments, and trends across our Users. We will take steps to remove personally identifying information from such messages, prior to reviewing them. We will not share the content of User messages or information we derive from them with any third party.

From time to time, we may contact you to see if you would like to take part in a research survey, provide feedback or a testimonial, or be part of a marketing campaign. For example, if you let us know you found a match on the App, we might ask if you want to be featured in Bumble advertising. We will provide you with more information when we contact you with any such request.

You can always say no and your participation is completely optional, but if you don’t want to be contacted regarding these requests, just tell our Customer Support Team via our [Feedback Page](https://bumble.com/contact-us).

If you contact our Customer Support team via our [Feedback Page](https://bumble.com/contact-us), we can track your IP address and will receive your email address and the information you share with us to help resolve your request.

We keep records of our communications with you for 6 years after your account is deleted, including any complaints from you about other people using the App or Sites.

When you use our App or visit our Sites, we can collect personal data from you automatically by using cookies or similar technologies.

Some cookies are necessary for the App and Sites to function and cannot be switched off, but you do have choices for others. Check out our [Cookie Policy](https://bumble.com/cookie-policy) to learn more about cookies, how we use them, and your options for these technologies.

Here at Bumble, we pride ourselves on taking all appropriate and reasonable security measures to:

*   help protect your information against loss, misuse, and unauthorised access or sharing
*   protect the confidentiality of your personal information, such as by using secured servers with firewalls

We will only use your information for email direct marketing if you consent when creating your account or in the App settings. If you ever change your mind, you can always withdraw from marketing in the App settings or by using the opt-out tools and links provided in our communications.

To achieve our goal of giving you an enjoyable connection experience, we use your personal information to:

*   **offer our services and features** to you
*   contact you with information about the App, such as **updates and new features**
*   **personalise** the App, Sites, and content we **deliver** to you
*   **carry out research and analysis** about how you use and interact with the App and Sites
*   **test new technologies and processes** meant to enhance and improve the App and Sites
*   **resolve** disputes, troubleshoot problems, and enforce our [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://bumble.com/terms)
*   **investigate fraud and protect** our legal rights
*   **protect third parties** and the people on our App and Sites from harm

*   if you’ve signed up for our communications or otherwise consented, **send you information** by direct marketing and other communication methods about our promotions and offers, such as letting you know the **types of goods, services, and offers we provide**.
    

We want to ensure the safety and security of everyone on our App and Sites, and give people the best possible user experience. To do this, we require every person using our App and Sites to verify their accounts.

We want to help you find the best possible connections, so we developed matching algorithms to predict your compatibility with others and show you people we think are a good match for you.

To predict your compatibility with others and recommend profiles, our matching algorithms use:

*   the information you share about yourself in your profile
*   information about your activity on the App
*   whether you’ve verified your photo
*   your device coordinates

Safety on our App and Sites is very important to us, so we take steps to make sure every person follows our [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://bumble.com/terms) while connecting. We use a combination of automated systems and a team of moderators to monitor and review accounts and messages for content that suggests a violation of our Terms and Conditions of Use. This process involves some personal information, such as photos and any other information uploaded to a profile or shared in messages.

We will issue a warning to the relevant account if any account or message meets the relevant criteria suggesting a likely violation. We can also restrict or block the relevant user’s access, who can contact Bumble to contest the decision.

If the legal basis is consent, you can withdraw your consent at any time. If the legal basis is legitimate interests, you have a right to object to how we use that information.  
How? Just [contact us](#contact-us--our-contact-information) or follow the instructions provided in the relevant sections of this Policy.

According to European Union (“EU”) and United Kingdom (“UK”) data protection laws, processing personal information must always have a specific lawful basis – meaning there must always be a legal reason, which is defined by the GDPR and other relevant laws. Here you will find the legal basis for all of the personal information we collect, use, and process.

Here at Bumble, we pride ourselves on taking all appropriate and reasonable security measures to:

*   help protect your information against loss, misuse, and unauthorised access or sharing
*   protect the confidentiality of your personal information, such as by using secured servers with firewalls

Because of this and the nature of this type of connecting, we encourage every person on our App and Sites to think carefully about the information you share about yourself with others. Be careful about posting information that may eventually be made public when using the App. You should always assume that anything you post or submit may be publicly-viewable and accessible to people on or off the App.

The information you post about yourself, put on your profile, or share with others is at your own risk – we are not responsible for the information you choose to share with others.

*   We recommend not putting sensitive information that could be used for abuse or misuse on your profile for others to see, such as:
    *   email addresses
    *   URLs
    *   instant messaging details
    *   phone numbers
    *   full names
    *   addresses
    *   credit card details
    *   national identity numbers
    *   driver's licence details
    *   any other sensitive information
*   Be careful when posting sensitive details about yourself on your profile or by adding certain Bumble badges to your profile, such as your religious denomination, political leanings, sexual preferences, and health information. Although you can voluntarily choose to provide us with this information when you create your profile, sharing these sensitive details is not required. And remember the photographs you post on Bumble can also reveal information about yourself.

*   When using the Bumble App, you should assume that anything you post or submit on the App may be publicly-viewable and accessible, both by Users and non-users of the App. We want our Users to be mindful about posting information that may eventually be made public. This includes certain information added to your profile by third-party accounts like Facebook, Instagram, or Spotify.
    *   For example, Bumble’s safety feature ‘Share Date’ allows Users to share their match’s Bumble name, photo, time and location of their date with their trusted contact. Also, a person using the App might recommend you as a match to their Facebook friend by sharing a screenshot of your profile picture, whether or not that friend also uses the App.
*   Some countries (currently only South Korea) might require that people have the option to download a copy of their conversation history. In this case, we have no control over how this information might then be used or shared after we are required to provide it.
*   Remember to log out of any app or third-party account you use to log in to or access our App when you are done to keep others from accessing your Bumble account.

If you use BFF, you should assume that whatever information you share in BFF can be seen by any BFF member. This includes information like which Hives you’ve joined and those conversations. BFF members can only see Hive discussions after they join the specific chat, which then gives them access to the full chat history.

You can choose to provide information like your beliefs, sexuality, and political leanings, but it’s not required. Just know that when you choose to share sensitive information like this about yourself with us for BFF, you are explicitly consenting to sharing that information with other BFF members.

If you use BFF and are in a region where our separate Bumble For Friends app is available, your BFF profile will automatically be visible both in BFF mode on the main Bumble App and on the separate Bumble For Friends app. We do this to provide you with a richer pool of potential friends to connect with. If you do not want your BFF profile to be shown on the Bumble For Friends app, just check out this [help page](https://support.bumbleforfriends.com/hc/en-us/articles/10594109952285-What-steps-should-I-take-if-I-object-to-my-profile-being-shown-on-both-BFF-mode-in-Bumble-and-Bumble-For-Friends).

We investigate and verify (also known as carrying out due diligence) all of the trusted third parties we work with, or “Service Providers”, to make sure they have adequate data protection and information security measures in place.

If you want to learn more or exercise your rights, just visit our [Feedback Page](https://bumble.com/contact-us), email our Data Protection Officer at [DPO@bumble.com](mailto:DPO@bumble.com), or [contact us](#contact-us--our-contact-information). To protect you and everyone on the App and Sites, we might need to ask you for specific information to help us confirm your identity before we answer your request.

If yes, there’s a bit more information you need to know. In addition to the rights we just described, people living in California have the following rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”):

Here at Bumble, we pride ourselves on taking all appropriate and reasonable security measures to:

*   help protect your information against loss, misuse, and unauthorised access or sharing
*   protect the confidentiality of your personal information, such as by using secured servers with firewalls

And don’t forget:

*   [Profile Verification Information](#data-collection--profile-verification-information): if you verify your profile, we only keep any biometric scans we receive so that we can verify you in the future and for our record-keeping purposes until we no longer need them for such purposes or for three years after your last interaction with us, whichever occurs first.

*   [Customer Support Contact Information](#data-collection--customer-support-contact-information): we keep records of our communications with you for 6 years after your account is deleted.

Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information may still be viewable or accessible if it was previously shared, copied, or stored with or by others. We cannot control this and we are not legally responsible or liable for this.

If you give third-party apps or websites access to your personal information, their own terms of service or privacy policies control how they handle your personal information.

If you give third-party apps or websites access to your personal information, their own terms of service or privacy policies control how they handle your personal information.

After these 28 days, we start the process of deleting your personal information, unless:

*   we must keep it to follow applicable law
*   we must keep it to prove we followed applicable law
*   there is an outstanding issue, claim, or dispute that requires us to keep the relevant information until it is resolved
*   the information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention and enhancing safety and security for people using our App and Sites

Our App and Sites are global – we want you to be able to access Bumble and make connections wherever you happen to be in the world. To make this possible, we operate a global network of servers to provide the App and Sites, and store your personal information. Our network includes servers in the US, UK, EU, and, for people located there, Russia. Here are some points to keep in mind:

*   We own the hardware for the servers, even if they’re physically located in a third-party data centre.
*   Your personal information will be sent to and used in the US and UK, no matter what country you live in.
*   The personal information collected by our trusted Service Providers and advertising partners might also be held outside the UK and EEA.

In any case, we make sure your personal information is adequately protected – especially when transferred overseas. We make sure that valid, legal mechanisms are in place, such as the [EU approved model clauses](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en), and enforce strong contractual standards. If you want more information about the protections we have in place, just email [DPO@bumble.com](mailto:DPO@bumble.com).

Unfortunately, using a website or the Internet is never 100% secure and even we can’t guarantee that unauthorised access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never happen. We can’t guarantee the security of your personal information while it is being transmitting to us, so any transmission is at your own risk.

This being said, here are some tips to help keep your data secure:

*   Always log out of your account when you’re done.
*   Never share your password with anyone else.
*   Regularly change your password.

If you ever think someone has access to your password or account, now or in the past, just follow these [steps](https://bumble.com/en/help/i-think-my-bumble-account-has-been-hacked).

Although we want as many people as possible to enjoy our creation, you must be at least 18 years old to use Bumble.

We do not knowingly collect any information or market to children, minors, or anyone under 18 years old. If we become aware that someone under 18 has registered a Bumble account and shared personal information with us, we will take steps to terminate that person’s registration.
