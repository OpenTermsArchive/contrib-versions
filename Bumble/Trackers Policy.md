1\. What are 'cookies' and which 'cookies' does Bumble use?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Unlike the chocolate chip kind, these cookies have no calories! We collect information by placing cookies on your computer or mobile device. A cookie is a piece of text containing a unique identifier, which is stored on your computer by your web browser or by your mobile device. They are basically a tool that stores information about App use and Websites’ visits. Cookies also allow us to recognise you and your preferences each time you visit Bumble. They ensure the functioning of the App and Websites which in turn allows us to provide the services that our members request and to improve your user experience.

We may also use other technologies such as web beacons (also called pixels), tracking URLs and software development kits (SDKs) for similar purposes as cookies. Web beacons are files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has accessed content on our Websites. Tracking URLs are unique links that help us understand where visitors to our Websites are coming from. SDKs are small pieces of code included in applications, which function like cookies and web beacons. For simplicity, in this Policy we also refer to these technologies as “Cookies”.
