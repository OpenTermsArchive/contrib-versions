Cookies Policy

In this Cookies Policy we explain the cookies which Bumble uses, the purposes for which cookies are used and how you can manage your preferences in relation to cookies.

What are 'cookies' and which 'cookies' does Bumble use?
-------------------------------------------------------

Unlike the chocolate chip kind, these cookies have no calories! We collect information by placing cookies on your computer or mobile phone. A cookie is a piece of text stored on your computer or mobile phone by your web browser. They are basically a tool that stores information about website visits, recognises you and your preferences each time you visit Bumble, and ensures site functionality enabling us to provide the services our members request.

When you visit the publicly available sections of Bumble, cookies which are necessary to make our application/site work (referred to as “strictly necessary” cookies) are placed on your device or mobile phone. For example, a session ID cookie is placed on your device or mobile phone that lasts for a limited time after your visit. We also place persistent cookies (also known as local storage devices) on users’ devices, so that Bumble remembers them and makes their login experience faster and easier. We may use persistent tracking cookies on your mobile device, mainly for security protection purposes, such as to prevent phishers, scammers and unauthorised login attempts. Strictly necessary cookies such as these will always be set, however, you can choose whether to turn on other cookies (as detailed further below), and you can change your cookie preferences at any time.

You may set your browser and your mobile phone settings to block cookies and local storage devices, but if you do so, you may not be able to access the features that Bumble offers. To manage your cookie settings, see [below](#cookie_settings).

Bumble’s use of cookies and local storage devices falls into the following categories:

*   those that are strictly necessary to deliver the services and products you have requested, such as, for example purchasing Bumble’s premium services. It is not possible to turn these cookies off because they are essential to enable us to provide the service that you have requested;
*   cookies related to the performance of Bumble’s site, such as analytics that help us determine how our site is performing and ensure a smooth and trouble-free experience for our members and visitors;
*   cookies related to the functionality of Bumble’s site, such as remembering your preferences at log in, remembering your preferred language or allowing you to chat, add photos and instant message Bumble members;
*   third party cookies which link to other social networks and which you request via social plugins; and
*   cookies used to improve and target advertising to you based on what’s relevant to you, to improve reporting on any advertising campaign and to avoid showing you ads you have already seen.

Bumble uses cookies and local storage devices so that we know who you are, what interests you and so that you can do the things online that you want to do, like chat with new people, share your content and buy Bumble premium services knowing that your data will be secure.
