In these terms and conditions, when we say the “Guardian Site” we mean the digital information network operated by or on behalf of Guardian News & Media Limited or its parent companies, subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively “Guardian”), regardless of how you access the network, as well as any Guardian apps whether you access those via a Guardian Site or a third party site. However you access the Guardian Site, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions. If you have accessed the Guardian Site from the United States or Australia, you also agree to be bound by additional terms contained at the end of these terms and conditions.

**16\. Additional disclaimers**

Visitors to the Guardian Site agree that their use of the Guardian Site is at their own sole risk. The Guardian Site is provided “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind, either express or implied including but not limited to: (i) any warranties concerning the availability, accuracy, appropriateness, reliability, timeliness, or usefulness of the content of the Guardian Site; and (ii) any warranties of title, warranty of non-infringement, or warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. Guardian also makes no representations and warranties as to any linked sites and Guardian has no liability or responsibility with respect to your use of such sites. In some instances, content made available on the Guardian Site may represent the opinions and judgments of providers or users, such as user content. Guardian and its affiliates do not endorse nor shall they be responsible or liable for the accuracy or reliability of any statement made on the Guardian Site by anyone other than authorised Guardian employees acting in such capacity.  
This disclaimer of liability applies to any damages or injuries caused by the Guardian Site, including, without limitation, those damages or injuries occurring as a result of: (i) any error, omission, deletion, or defect in the content available on the Guardian Site; or (ii) any failure of performance, error, omission, interruption, deletion, defect, delay in operation or transmission, computer virus, communication line failure, theft or destruction of records, information or data, unauthorised access to, alteration of, or use of records, information or data, whether for breach of contract, tort, negligence, defamation, or any other cause of action. Guardian does not warrant or guarantee that access to the Guardian Site will be uninterrupted or error-free.  
Applicable law may not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so the above exclusion may not apply to you.

**17\. Limitation of liability**

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, IN NO EVENT WILL GUARDIAN OR ITS AFFILIATES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PARTY FOR ANY DIRECT OR INDIRECT LOSS, DAMAGE, COST, EXPENSE OR LIABILITY OF ANY KIND (“LOSS”) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE AVAILABILITY, USE, RELIANCE ON, OR INABILITY TO USE THE GUARDIAN SITE, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION): (i) DAMAGES FOR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS AND OTHER PROFITS, LOSS OF PROGRAMS, COST OF REPLACING EQUIPMENT OR SOFTWARE OR LOSS OF RECORDS, INFORMATION OR DATA, LOSS OF USE OF DATA, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF CUSTOMERS, LOSS OF OR DAMAGE TO REPUTATION, LOSS OF CAPITAL, DOWNTIME COSTS, LOSS UNDER OR IN RELATION TO ANY OTHER CONTRACT, OR LOSS OF ANTICIPATED SAVINGS OR BENEFITS; (ii) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS; OR (iii) ANY LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR OTHER INACCURACIES IN THE GUARDIAN SITE. THE EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY IN THIS SECTION 17 APPLIES EVEN IF GUARDIAN SHALL HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS.

BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PARTICULAR KINDS OF LOSS, IN SUCH STATES OR JURISDICTIONS, GUARDIAN’S LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW (THEREBY MINIMIZING GUARDIAN’S LIABILITY TO YOU TO THE LOWEST AMOUNT THAT APPLICABLE LAW PERMITS).

**18\. Exclusion of warranties (for Australian users)**

The Australian Consumer Law may confer certain rights and remedies on you in relation to the provision by Guardian of goods and services under these terms and conditions. Notwithstanding the disclaimers and limitations of liability in Sections 4, 16 and 17 above, these terms and conditions do not exclude, restrict or modify the application of any condition, warranty, guarantee, right or remedy conferred by or implied under any provision of the Australian Consumer Law or any other statute where to do so would: (i) contravene the relevant statute; or (ii) cause any part of these terms and conditions to be void and/or unenforceable (“Non-Excludable Obligation”).

Except in relation to Non-Excludable Obligations, all conditions, warranties and other provisions implied or conferred by statute, custom, or the general law that impose any liability or obligation on Guardian are expressly excluded under these terms and conditions.

**19\. Non-Excludable Obligations (for Australian users)**

In relation to Non-Excludable Obligations (other than a guarantee as to title, encumbrances or quiet possession conferred by the Australian Consumer Law), except for goods or services of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use or consumption (in respect of which our liability is not so limited under these terms and conditions), Guardian’s liability to you for a failure to comply with any Non-Excludable Obligation is limited to: (i) in the case of services, the lowest of the cost of supplying the services again and payment of the cost of having the services supplied again; and (ii) in the case of goods, the lowest of the cost of replacing the goods, supplying equivalent goods or having the goods repaired, or payment of the cost of replacing the goods, supplying equivalent goods or having the goods repaired.
