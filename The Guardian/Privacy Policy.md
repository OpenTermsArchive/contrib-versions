Introduction
------------

This is the privacy policy for Guardian News & Media Limited (collectively referred to as “Guardian”, “we”, “us” or “our” in this policy), our sites such as theguardian.com (“our sites”), and our associated apps. Some of our other sites and services have their own policies, which will be relevant to you when you are using those sites and services.

Our [values](https://www.theguardian.com/global/blog/2015/sep/22/living-our-values-facts-guardian) guide everything that we do – including our editorial approach and how we use personal data. We are strongly committed to keeping your personal data safe. This commitment exists throughout the lifecycle of your personal data, from the design of any Guardian service which uses personal data to the deletion of that data.

To complement our global approach to privacy protection, this policy also incorporates specific information privacy rights granted to individuals under Californian and Australian privacy law. This reflects our relationship with our readers in these locations where we provide localised editions of our editorial content.

We think carefully about our use of personal data, and below you can find the details of what we do to protect your privacy. This policy covers, among other topics:

* Information about your rights, the choices available to you, and our obligations in the UK, European Union, in California, in Australia, and elsewhere.
    
* Transparency about how we collect and use your personal data, including when and how it is shared.
    
* Information on how we protect your personal data.
    
* Information on how we will facilitate your rights and respond to your questions.

-----------------------------

We use personal data collected through our sites and apps only when we have a valid reason and the legal grounds to do so. We determine the legal grounds based on the purposes for which we have collected your personal data.

_Legal grounds for using your personal data_

The legal ground may be one of the following:

* _Consent_: Often we will use your personal data because we have asked for your consent, which you can withdraw at any time. Please refer to the table below for examples of where we ask for your consent.
    
* _Performance of a contract with you_ (or in order to take steps prior to entering into a contract with you): We will use your personal data if we need to in order to perform a contract with you. For example, where you have purchased a subscription from us, we will need to use your contact details and payment data in order to process your order and deliver your subscription or we may contact you directly via social media or email if you enter competitions, prize draws, bids or respond to call-outs.
    
* _Compliance with law_: In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to use or keep your personal data.
    
* _Our legitimate interests_: We may process your personal data where it is necessary for our legitimate interests in a way that might be expected as part of running the Guardian and in a way which does not materially impact your rights and freedoms. For example, it is in our legitimate interests for us to understand our readers, promote our services and ways to support us, and operate our sites and apps efficiently for the creation, publication and distribution of news, media and related journalistic content both online and in print form, globally. Please refer to the table below for examples of when we rely on our legitimate interests to use your personal data.

Where we rely on cookies to collect any personal data please see our [cookie policy](https://www.theguardian.com/info/cookies) for more information and how to manage your cookie choices through our “Privacy Settings” link on our sites in the footer of every page.

The Guardian is a media organisation and publisher. Data protection law includes certain exemptions when personal data is processed for the purposes of journalism. Those exemptions apply to some of the ways the Guardian uses personal data. This privacy policy does not cover personal data that the Guardian processes for the purposes of journalism.

_Access permissions when you are using the Guardian app_

When you use the Guardian app, we will ask for permissions to access particular functions of your mobile device. When we ask for permissions will depend on the operating system of your mobile device, but can include:

For more information on how to manage your account please see [https://manage.theguardian.com/help-centre](https://manage.theguardian.com/help-centre).

You may also update your marketing preferences in the “Emails and marketing” and/or “Data privacy” tabs in your account.

Personal data that we receive about you from other organisations
----------------------------------------------------------------

_Adding to or combining the personal data you provide to us_

When you sign up to our services we may add to the personal data you give us by combining it with other personal data shared with us by other trusted organisations. This includes, for example, the region that you are located in, so that we can show you the prices for subscriptions or other products in your local currency. We may also add personal data to improve the accuracy of your delivery address when we send out mail. We may also obtain your personal data from partners whose offers we include in some of our marketing communications and we use this personal data to ensure that we do not send you irrelevant marketing and to ensure the accuracy of the information we hold.

We also use personal data based on the content you have viewed on our sites and apps and your interaction with the content to add you to groups with similar interests and preferences, so that we can make our online advertising more relevant. Sometimes we use data about your interests or demographics that some of our global third parties have collected from you online to add you to these groups, such as Comscore and Nielsen. Please refer to our [cookie policy](https://www.theguardian.com/info/cookies) for more information on how we use cookies.

_Personal data shared by event partners_

When you register or book a ticket for a Guardian event organised by an event partner, your registration data may be shared with us by the event partner.

Children’s personal data
------------------------

We do not aim any of our products or services directly at children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal data about children under 13 in providing our services. Some of our services may have a higher age restriction and this will be shown at the point of registration.

We also note and comply with the California law which prohibits sale of personal data of consumers between 13-16 years of age unless their guardian has authorised the sale.

Security of your personal data
------------------------------

We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational controls to protect your personal data against unauthorised processing and against accidental loss, damage or destruction. You are responsible for choosing a secure password when we ask you to set up a password to access parts of our sites or apps. You should keep this password confidential and you should choose a password that you do not use on any other site. You should not share your password with anyone else, including anyone who works for us. Unfortunately, sending any information, including personal data, via the internet is not completely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of any personal data sent to our site while still in transit and so you provide it at your own risk.

When we share your personal data
--------------------------------

_Within the Guardian group of companies_

Depending on where you live, we may share your personal data within the Guardian group of companies in the UK, US, or Australia. We may share it in order to perform a contract with you, for administrative purposes, or when we have a legitimate interest in doing so. For example:

* If you book an event held in Australia, at first we may hold your data on our systems in the UK and then we may share it with the Guardian in Australia for administration purposes.
    
* Sometimes we may receive a letter, email or another form of communication from you that we consider to be significant to the history of the Guardian. We may decide to share this with the Guardian Archive run by the Guardian Foundation for historic and archiving purposes.
    
* We may share your data to understand how you interact across our group products or to tailor and offer relevant advertising to you.
    

_With external organisations_

We share your personal data with other organisations that are not directly linked to us under the following circumstances:

_Service providers_ - We may share your data with other organisations that provide services on our behalf. We may do this to perform a contract we have entered into with you, where it is in our legitimate interests or with your consent. Examples of when we may share your data with service providers include sharing with:

* Google ReCaptcha, which we use to protect our sites and apps from fraudulent users.
    
* Data management companies, such as Formstack, that help us collect data via online forms and surveys.

* Service providers that allow us to compare your personal data with information held by advertising partners and identify if you are known to both us and our advertising partner, such as InfoSum.
    
* YouTube because we use their unbranded embedded player to provide video content on our websites and apps. The embedded player relies on the YouTube API, which is a type of software that allows data to be communicated between our website and apps and the YouTube player. This will include personal data which will also be collected by cookies as set out in our [cookie policy](https://www.theguardian.com/info/cookies). We will provide this data about how you interact with videos to enable YouTube to provide statistical information such as how many views a video has, or how many users watch the entire video. More information about how YouTube will use this personal data, which includes usage data when you interact or use the embedded YouTube player, can be found at the Google Privacy Policy: [http://www.google.com/policies/privacy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy).
    

_Advertising partners_ - We may also share your data collected through our websites and apps with our advertising partners, as set out in our [cookie policy](https://www.theguardian.com/info/cookies). These partners help us deliver relevant advertising across our websites and apps. For example, we use Google Ad Manager to assist us with the delivery of relevant ads.

_Agencies and authorities if required by law_ - We may reveal your personal data to any law enforcement agency, court, regulator, government authority, or in connection with any legal action if we are required to do so to meet a legal or regulatory obligation, where the request is proportionate, or otherwise to protect our rights or the rights of anyone else (for example, in response to a valid and properly served legal process such as subpoena or warrant). If we have your contact details, we will take reasonable steps to attempt to notify you prior to disclosing your data unless (i) prohibited by applicable law from doing so, or (ii) there are clear indications of unlawful conduct in connection with your use of Guardian services.

_Event sponsors and partners_ - We may share your personal data with sponsors of Guardian events and partners who we hold events with for marketing purposes when you have given your permission for us to do so. We may also share your personal data with these sponsors and partners for event administration purposes.

_Prize draws, competitions and bids_ \- We may share your personal data with sponsors and partners for the purposes of selecting and notifying winners when you participate in any of our prize draws, competitions and bids. We may also share your data with entities offering any prize you have won in order for that entity to contact you about such a prize.

_Social media organisations_ - We may share your personal data with other organisations when our web pages use social plug-ins from these organisations (such as liking or sharing on social media). These other organisations may receive and use personal data about your visit to our sites or apps. If you browse our site or view content on our apps, personal data they collect may be connected to your account on their site. For more information on how these organisations use personal data, please read their privacy policies.

_Organisation/s that buy any of the Guardian group companies_ - We may share your personal data to any other organisation that buys, or to which we transfer all, or substantially all, of our assets and business. If this sale or transfer takes place, we will use reasonable efforts to try to make sure that the organisation we transfer your personal data to uses it in line with our privacy policy.

When we share your personal data, as specified above, with any organisation which accesses your data in the course of providing services on our behalf, they will be governed by strict contractual restrictions to make sure that they protect your data and comply with applicable law. We may also independently audit these service providers to make sure that they meet our standards.

_California resident - Do not sell_

These transfers to third parties may constitute “sale” of your personal information under California law. A California resident can halt these sales at any time by pressing the “California resident - Do not sell” link that is located in the footer of every page on our site. Third-parties do not sell personal information that has been sold to them by the Guardian unless you have first received explicit notice and are provided an opportunity to exercise the right to opt out.

International data transfers
----------------------------

Data we collect may be transferred to, stored and processed in any country or territory where one or more of our Guardian group companies or service providers are based or have facilities. While other countries or territories may not have the same standards of data protection as those in your home country, we will continue to protect personal data that we transfer in line with this privacy policy.

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the UK or the European Economic Area (EEA), we ensure similar protection and put in place at least one of these safeguards:

* We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been found to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data.
    
* We may also use specific approved contracts that use Standard Contractual Clauses for the protection of personal data where appropriate, with our service providers that are based in countries outside the UK or the EEA, including those based in the US and Australia. These contracts give your personal data the same protection it has in the UK or the EEA.
    

If you are located in the UK or the EEA, you may contact us for a copy of the safeguards which we have put in place for the transfer of your personal data outside the UK or the EEA.

How long we keep your personal data
-----------------------------------

We keep your personal data for only as long as we need to. How long we need your personal data depends on what we are using it for, as set out in this privacy policy. For example, we may need to use it to answer your queries about a product or service and as a result may keep personal data while you are still using our product or services. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means. We may also need to keep your personal data for accounting purposes, for example, where you have bought a subscription. If we no longer need your data, we will delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details that identify you. If we have asked for your permission to process your personal data and we have no other lawful grounds to continue with that processing, and you withdraw your permission, we will delete your personal data. However, when you unsubscribe from marketing communications, we will keep your email address to ensure that we do not send you any marketing in future.

How we may contact you
----------------------

_Service communications_

From time to time we may send you service emails or SMS, for example, telling you your subscription is coming to an end or thanking you when you contribute or place an order with us.

_Marketing communications and editorial newsletters_

If we have your permission or you have not opted out, we may send you materials we think may interest you, such as new Guardian offers and updates. Depending on your marketing preferences, which you can amend in the “Emails and marketing” tab of your Guardian account, this may be by email, phone, SMS or post.

We offer a range of editorial newsletters. You can manage your subscription to these emails through your profile page when you are signed in to your Guardian account.

You can decide not to receive these emails at any time and will be able to “unsubscribe” directly by clicking a link in the email or through your email preferences in the tab “Emails and marketing” when you are signed in to your Guardian account.

For more information on how to manage your account please see [https://manage.theguardian.com/help-centre](https://manage.theguardian.com/help-centre).

Sometimes we may contact you for market research purposes, for example about a survey. You can opt out from being contacted in this way by signing into your Guardian account and going to the tab “emails and marketing”.

_Responding to your queries or complaints_

If you have raised a query or a complaint with us, we may contact you to answer your query or to resolve your complaint.

We are required to treat your personal information in line with those principles, including to disclose to you what personal information we collect and how we use it, to store your information securely and to support you in exercising your rights.

**Personal information we collect and use**

When we refer to “personal data” throughout this policy, we are also referencing “personal information,” as it is defined under Australian law, which you can read about [here](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/australian-privacy-principles-guidelines/chapter-b-key-concepts/).

Details about the personal information that we collect, use and disclose is set out throughout this privacy policy. You can navigate these relevant sections by going to the contents section at the top of the page.

**Your rights**

Your rights to privacy are also protected by the Australian Privacy Act, including your:

* Right of access to the personal information held about you; and
    
* Right of correction to correct your information when it is incorrect.
    

These principles and rights are reflected throughout this privacy policy.

_Opt out of personalised advertising_

You can opt out of personalised advertising across our website and apps at any time by going to the “Privacy Settings” link on our sites in the footer of every page. You will still see non-personalised advertising.
