The “data processor” is the company that performs data processing at the request of a data controller. Thus, Brevo (ex Sendinblue) acts as a data processor to make its Services available to Users, who define the purpose and the means of the processing. Brevo may also use secondary processors (“sub-processors”) to carry out data processing on its behalf.

In the context of the Services provided to the User, Brevo (ex Sendinblue) is required to carry out personal data processing operations on behalf of the User. This processing is carried out for the duration of the contractual relationship between Brevo (ex Sendinblue) and the User.

### 1\. Brevo (ex Sendinblue)’s Obligations

#### a) User’s instructions

Brevo (ex Sendinblue) undertakes to process personal data only for the purposes of performing the Services in accordance with the User’s instructions. Thus, Brevo (ex Sendinblue) agrees not to concede, rent, transfer or otherwise communicate to another person, all or part of the personal data, even free of charge, and not to use the personal data for purposes other than those provided in the General Conditions of Use.

In the event that Brevo (ex Sendinblue) considers that an instruction given by the User constitutes a violation of an applicable law, Brevo (ex Sendinblue) must immediately inform the User.

#### b) Confidentiality and security

Brevo (ex Sendinblue) guarantees the confidentiality of personal data processed in connection with the Services. As such, it ensures (i) that personal data is communicated only to persons who need to know it, (ii) that these persons are aware of the User’s instructions and undertake to process the personal data entrusted to them only in strict compliance with the instructions and for no other purpose, (iii) that they are subject to an appropriate contractual or legal obligation of confidentiality, and (iv) that they receive the necessary training in the field of data protection.

Brevo (ex Sendinblue) undertakes to implement the appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to preserve the confidentiality and security of personal data and, in particular, to prevent it from being distorted, damaged or communicated to unauthorised third parties, and more generally, to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised dissemination or access, as well as against any form of unlawful processing, it being specified that these measures must ensure, taking into account best practice and the costs associated with their implementation, a level of security appropriate to the risks presented by the processing and the nature of the data to be protected and, more generally, in order to guarantee a level of security of personal data appropriate to the risk.

#### c) Notification of violations of personal data

In the event of an accidental or unlawful breach of security resulting in the destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or unauthorised access to, personal data processed by Brevo (ex Sendinblue), Brevo (ex Sendinblue) undertakes to immediately notify the User within 72 hours of the detection of the incident.

In such circumstances, and in consultation with the User, Brevo (ex Sendinblue) undertakes to put in place the necessary data protection measures and to limit any negative effects on the data subjects.

Brevo (ex Sendinblue) undertakes to provide the User with all reasonable information and assistance to enable the latter to comply with its obligations to notify the data protection authorities and, where applicable, the data subjects.

#### d) User support

Brevo (ex Sendinblue) undertakes, as far as possible, to assist the User in fulfilling its own obligations. Thus, Brevo (ex Sendinblue) shall:

* take charge of the requests to unsubscribe from distribution lists on behalf of the User;
* respond promptly to any request from the User concerning the personal data processed, in order to enable the User to take into account, within the time limits set, any potential requests from data subjects (right of access, right of rectification, right of destruction, etc.), and more generally to take into account the nature of the processing and help the User through appropriate technical and organisational measures to comply with their obligation to respond to requests submitted by the data subjects with a view to exercising their rights;

#### e) Data access / deletion

At any time during the implementation of the General Conditions of Use, the User may access the personal data processed by Brevo (ex Sendinblue) or delete it directly from the Site using the export and integrated deletion features.

At the end of the contractual relationship, Brevo (ex Sendinblue) undertakes, at the User’s request, to destroy all personal data, or to return it to the User or another data processor designated by them if technically feasible and within a maximum period of 3 months. The return must be accompanied by the destruction of existing copies in Brevo (ex Sendinblue)’s information systems, unless any applicable law requires their retention.

### 2\. Audit

Brevo (ex Sendinblue) undertakes to provide the User with all the information and documents necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations set out herein.

Brevo (ex Sendinblue) authorises the User or any other external auditor not competing with Brevo (ex Sendinblue) and mandated by the User to inspect and audit its personal data processing activities, and undertakes to accede to all reasonable requests made by the User to verify that Brevo (ex Sendinblue) complies with the contractual obligations imposed by this Annex.

It is agreed that, subject to any requests from the regulators to this effect, such audits may take place no more than once (1) per contract year. In all cases, the User must give Brevo (ex Sendinblue) a minimum notice of fifteen (15) days, and the audit must in no case disrupt the ongoing activities of Brevo (ex Sendinblue). The audit will be limited to the personal data processing activities performed by Brevo (ex Sendinblue) on behalf of the User, and the User will not be able to access data concerning other Brevo (ex Sendinblue) customers.

Brevo (ex Sendinblue) undertakes to communicate all supporting documentation proving the compliance of the processing with the User’s instructions, and that the appropriate security measures have indeed been put in place.

### 3\. Sub-processing

The User is informed, and expressly accepts, that Brevo (ex Sendinblue) may have recourse to sub-processors within the context of the Services, who will have access/process the personal data entrusted by the User on their behalf. The list of the relevant processors is as follows: [see the list](https://bit.ly/subcontactors-SIB-EN-int).

The User is made aware that some of these sub-processors are located in countries outside the European Union, including in the United States, and, as such, the User expressly authorizes Brevo (ex Sendinblue) to transfer personal data outside the European Union. Brevo (ex Sendinblue) undertakes to put in place all the necessary guarantees in order to supervise these transfers in compliance with the applicable rules.

In this context, the User shall expressly mandate Brevo (ex Sendinblue) to sign, in its name and on its behalf, standard contractual clauses ” data controller to data processor ” with the sub-processors (see the standard clauses of the European Commission at the following address: [https://commission.europa.eu/system/files/2021-06/1\_en\_annexe\_acte\_autonome\_cp\_part1\_v5\_0.pdf](https://commission.europa.eu/system/files/2021-06/1_en_annexe_acte_autonome_cp_part1_v5_0.pdf) ).

In the event of modification of the list of its sub-processors, Brevo (ex Sendinblue) will notify the User by email or by notification through the customer account, and the User will have the possibility to cancel the subscription in the event of an objection. It is specified that this notification will include any information relating to possible transfers of personal data outside the European Union.

**Subscription.** This section applies to paying Customers who sign up for a paid Services plan online or via a purchase order established by our services. 

By subscribing to a paid Services plan, the subscription contract comes into effect from the date of subscription, for an initial period chosen by the Customer.  

At the end of the initial period, the subscription is automatically renewed for successive periods equivalent to the initial period. 

Unless otherwise specified in a purchase order, the Customer may, at any time, terminate the automatic renewal by cancelling their subscription from their Account. 

When the Customer ends the renewal, the subscription continues until the end of the current period and is not renewed. Any remaining credits will be lost.

**Payment.** When you sign up to a paid Services plan online, you are required to select a plan level and you will be charged according to the terms of the applicable paid plan level. You are responsible for paying the fees associated with the plan level you have selected, as well as any and all applicable sales and use taxes for your purchase of Services based on the address that you provide at signup. Your monthly or annual payment is due on the date you sign up and billing for the following month or years will occur on the same date each month or year. 

If you downgrade or upgrade your plan level during a billing cycle, we will issue a credit note for the remaining prepaid amount on a pro-rata basis. The credit note will automatically be applied to your next invoice. 

You are required to maintain a valid payment method, such as debit or credit card information, on file with us. You authorize Brevo to charge your payment method for the amount due to Brevo for the Services, any sales and use taxes and any applicable late fees or interest. If your card is replaced for any reason, you authorize us to charge such replacement card for the amount due to Brevo for any Services. The person submitting the card for payment represents and warrants that they are authorized to use such card, that the card may be charged as agreed herein, and that such charges will not be rejected. You agree that you are solely liable for any payment or credit card fraud, abuse or unauthorized use by you or others. 

If we stop providing the service to you for any reason and terminate your account without cause, we will provide you a refund of the pro rata amount of the monthly or annual charge that was prepaid.  Otherwise, you won’t be entitled to a refund or credit for any reason.  

If you do not pay on time or if we cannot charge the payment method you have on file for any reason, we reserve the right to either suspend or terminate your access to the Services. In addition, if any payment is not received within 30 days after the due date, then we may charge a late fee of $10 and we may assess interest at the rate of 1.5% of the outstanding balance per month (18% per year), or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, from 30 days after the due date until the date paid. If your unpaid fees are referred to an attorney or collections agency, you shall pay all reasonable attorney’s fees or collections agency fees.

You represent that you are the owner of any Customer Content you submit and/or have the necessary rights, licenses, and authorization to distribute it. 

By submitting your Customer Content, you hereby grant us an irrevocable, worldwide, fully paid-up and royalty free, non-exclusive, unlimited license, including the right to sublicense and assign to third parties, and the right to use and disclose your Customer Content, in order to provide you with the Services, during the performance of these Terms.

**Governing Law and Venue**. Claims relating to, including the use of, the Services and the Contents contained herein are governed by the laws of the United States and the State of Washington, without regard to its conflicts of laws rules.

You waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over you by such courts and to venue in such courts.

**Class Action Waiver.** YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO COMMENCE OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST SENDINBLUE RELATED TO ANY CLAIM, DISPUTE OR CONTROVERSY, AND, WHERE APPLICABLE, YOU HEREBY AGREE TO OPT OUT OF ANY CLASS PROCEEDING AGAINST SENDINBLUE OTHERWISE COMMENCED.

**Arbitration Agreement.** Please read this section carefully. This section affects rights that you may otherwise have. It provides for resolution of most disputes through arbitration instead of court trials and class actions.

YOU AGREE TO GIVE UP ANY RIGHTS TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN A COURT OR BEFORE A JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS ACCESS TO DISCOVERY, ALSO MAY BE UNAVAILABLE OR LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.

Any claim or dispute brought by you arising from or relating to these Terms, or to the relationships that result from these Terms, including disputes about the validity, scope, or enforceability of this arbitration provision (collectively, “Covered Disputes”) may, at Brevo (ex Sendinblue)’s option and in its sole discretion, be settled exclusively by binding, individual arbitration, rather than in court, and to be held in King County, Washington, or another location mutually agreeable to the parties. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association under its rules and procedures. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. Prior to initiating any arbitration, you will give Brevo (ex Sendinblue) at least 60 days’ advanced written notice of your intent to file for arbitration.  You must provide such notice by email to [\[email protected\]](https://www.sendinblue.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) During such 60-day notice period, the parties will endeavor to settle amicably by mutual discussions any Covered Disputes. Failing such amicable settlement and expiration of the notice period, either party may initiate arbitration. The arbitrator will have the power to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity, and any award of the arbitrator(s) will be final and binding on each of the parties. Judgment upon the award rendered by an arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms, and the failure to do so will be deemed an excess of arbitral authority and grounds for judicial review. You are not entitled to arbitrate any Covered Dispute as a class, representative, or private attorney action, and the arbitrator(s) will have no authority to proceed on a class, representative, or private attorney general basis. If any provision of the agreement to arbitrate in this section is found illegal or unenforceable, the remaining arbitration terms shall continue to be fully valid, binding, and enforceable (but in no case will there be a class, representative, or private attorney general arbitration). These Terms and related transactions will be subject to and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sec. 1-16 (FAA) and, where otherwise applicable, by the laws of the State of Washington. Brevo (ex Sendinblue) reserves all rights to pursue any and all claims and remedies, whether in a court of law or other tribunal, and in no way shall the foregoing be interpreted to limit Brevo (ex Sendinblue)’s rights in this regard. 

**General.** No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Brevo (ex Sendinblue) as a result of these Terms or your use of the Services. If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect. You hereby consent to Brevo (ex Sendinblue) publicizing the existence (but not the terms) of the relationship contemplated hereunder as a part of Brevo (ex Sendinblue)’s promotional and marketing activities from time to time. These Terms, along with the agreements incorporated by reference herein, constitute the entire agreement between Brevo (ex Sendinblue) and you with respect to your access to and use of the Services and your Brevo (ex Sendinblue) account, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether oral or written, between Brevo (ex Sendinblue) and you with respect thereto and, with respect to your use of the Services, supersedes the terms of any other party’s terms and conditions. These Terms may be executed by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, as applicable to the Services, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original for all purposes, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument. The failure of Brevo (ex Sendinblue) to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

**Consent to Do Business Electronically.** By accessing our Services, subscribing with us, creating a Brevo (ex Sendinblue) account, typing your name into any of our electronic forms and indicating your acceptance, or submitting information by clicking a box, you consent to (a) Brevo (ex Sendinblue) communicating with you electronically; (b) receiving all applications, notices, disclosures and authorizations (collectively, “Records”) from Brevo (ex Sendinblue) electronically; and (c) entering into agreements and transactions using electronic Records and signatures. Please note that federal law treats electronic signatures as having the same legal force and effect as if they were signed on paper by hand, and online contracts have the same legal force as signing an equivalent paper contract in ink. Brevo (ex Sendinblue) will use electronic documents for all communications, agreements, disclosures, authorizations, and other documents necessary to provide you with the Services. You must have a computer or other web-enabled device, a connection to the internet, an active email account, and the ability to receive and read electronic files to conduct business with us electronically. You agree to be responsible for keeping your own Records. You may print or download Records from the Services and keep them for your own reference.
