### I. General Conditions of Use

**Preamble**

Sendinblue, a simplified joint-stock company registered with the Paris Trade and Companies Register under number 498 019 298 with its registered office at 106 boulevard Haussmann 75008 Paris (hereafter “Brevo“) operates a solution relating to marketing and/or transactional email and/or SMS via its website [www.brevo.com](https://www.brevo.com/) (“[the Site](https://www.brevo.com/)“).

The purpose of these General Conditions of Use is to define the terms of use of Brevo Services. They constitute a legal and binding agreement between Brevo and any user of the [www.brevo.com](https://www.brevo.com/) platform (the “User”).

To access, browse, or use our Services, the User must agree to be unconditionally bound by these Terms. The User can accept the Terms by clicking to accept or by agreeing to the Terms where this option is made available in any agreement, electronic form, or the user interface for any Service Brevo (ex Sendinblue) offers, or by actually using the Services. By subscribing to or using the Site, the Platform or the Services, the User will be deemed to have read and accepted without reservation the current version of these General Terms of Use and the User represents and warrants that its representative is at least 18 years of age and that this representative possess the legal right and ability to enter into these Terms of Use. As the Users are accessing the Services on behalf of a legal entity, the User represents and warrant that its representative is authorized to act on behalf of the legal entity and to bind such legal entity to these Terms of Use. The User warrants that the organization the User represents is not be based in Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, or any other territory that is subject to a U.S. government embargo or international sanction and that it is not listed on any U.S. government list of prohibited or restricted person.

Any special conditions potentially negotiated between Brevo and the User shall prevail over these General Conditions of Use.

The terms used in this document are defined as follows:

The “User” means any natural or legal person authorized to use the Brevo Services.

The “Services” provided by Brevo are the features made available to Users via the Site, in accordance with the applicable Version of the Software, such as sending SMSs and emails, providing reports or optimising the deliverability of messages sent (the complete list of features is available at the following address: [https://brevo.com/features/](https://sendinblue.com/features/)).

The “data processor” is the company that performs data processing at the request of a data controller. Thus, Brevo (ex Sendinblue) acts as a data processor to make its Services available to Users, who define the purpose and the means of the processing. Brevo may also use secondary processors (“sub-processors”) to carry out data processing on its behalf.

The “User’s data” is understood as data processed by Brevo on behalf of the Users within the framework of the performance of the Services subscribed.

“Personal data” means information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.

“Software” shall mean the suite of software owned and/or operated by Brevo or its affiliates and/or delivered under the business name Brevo and necessary to provide the Services.

“Version”: shall mean all the releases of the Software developed by Brevo. All releases shall apply to the User as part of Brevo’s standard software and Services. A release may create, modify or discontinue one or several feature(s) of the Service.

The “Parties” shall mean Brevo and the User.

### 1) Purpose of Brevo (formerly Sendinblue) Services

Brevo provides solutions relating to marketing and/or transactional email and/or SMS , through its sending platform, marketed via the Site.

### 2) User account management

The use of Brevo Services requires the creation of an online account.

The Users are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide and undertake to update the information concerning them or to notify Brevo without delay of any change affecting their situation.

The Users shall take all useful measures to maintain the confidentiality of access to their account.

In the event of fraudulent use of their account, the Users undertake to immediately notify Brevo and change their access password without delay.

Any costs resulting from such unauthorised use shall be borne by the Users until Brevo has been notified by them of such use.

Brevo shall in no event be liable for material or immaterial damages resulting from the use of the account by a third party, with or without the Users’ permission.

Brevo shall store messages sent through its platform on behalf of the Users. Distribution lists shall be maintained as long as the Users correctly set up and update their account. Brevo shall protect the integrity, confidentiality and administrative, material and technical security of the Users’ personal information.

### 3) Financial conditions

By subscribing to Brevo Services, the Users agree to pay the price corresponding to the Services selected and to their country of residence.

Unless specifically otherwise stipulated, the prices of the Services subscribed shall be paid at the time of subscription and in the currency in which they were invoiced, **_in accordance with the financial conditions detailed here:_** **_[https://www.brevo.com/pricing/](https://www.brevo.com/pricing/)_****_._**

The prices displayed on the Site are exclusive of charges, and they do not include VAT. Additional charges shall be applied on the invoice according to the Users’ country of residence and applicable legal and regulatory provisions. If the User’s organization subjects invoicing and/or payment to the creation or update by Brevo of an account on a specific invoicing platform, and/or if the User’s organization only accepts payment via wire transfer, Brevo reserves the right to charge an annual additional fee of 100 euros.

Once logged in the platform, or by subscribing via our Pay as you go page ([https://www.brevo.com/pricing/pay-as-you-go/](https://www.brevo.com/pricing/pay-as-you-go/)), the User can also purchase SMS or WhatsApp messages on a pay-as-you-go basis, with a unit price fixed country by country. Unit prices of SMS and WhatsApp messages depend on the market prices, applied by our suppliers and third parties, and may therefore evolve during the performance of the contract. Once notified to us by our suppliers or WhatsApp, the price increase shall immediately be applied to the Users. Users can request the communication of the current price list relevant to the destination countries for which they purchased SMS and/or WhatsApp messages at **[\[email protected\]](https://www.sendinblue.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)****.** When using WhatsApp messages, the User might benefit from a fixed monthly volume of free WhatsApp messages, as described as the case may be on our Pay as you go page: this offer is only valid as long as (i) the User owns a verified WhatsApp Business account and (ii) WhatsApp provides those messages for free. The monthly volume of free WhatsApp messages resets at the end of each month.

### **3.1. General Provisions** 

Subject to the Client’s eligibility, the Client may benefit from Payment Services enabling it to:  

* Create and use a Brevo Payment Account, 
* Use a Brevo Payment Card if they so request, and/or
* Create Payment Pages and Payment Links that the Client may implement on its own website or send directly to the End Customers.

The Payment Service is limited to (eligibility criteria): 

* Clients with their corporate seat in the European Economic Area and / or United Kingdom (“Territory”); 
* Clients that are legal entities acting in the course of business or acting within the scope of an economic activity (i.e. non-consumer trade, business, craft, or liberal profession, non-profit organizations);
* Clients who have a virtual account with the PSP or are issued a bank account from the PSP; 
* Clients who have accepted the Payment Service Provider Terms and as the case may be the Card User Terms available online.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, PSP in its sole discretion may reject the provision of the Payment Service to the Client and update the Client eligibility criteria from time to time by providing reasonable prior notice to Brevo. In this case, Brevo shall make its best efforts to provide such information to the Client in due time and shall comply with PSP’s instruction.

### **3.2. Brevo Payment Account** 

**3.2.1**. Subject to the Client’s eligibility, the Payment Service allows the Client to access a Brevo Payment Account. 

**3.2.2.** From its Brevo Payment Account, the Client will be able to:

* Receive the amounts collected through the Payment Links and/or Payment Pages, 
* Consult the information relating to its Brevo Payment Account including but not limited to the balance of such Payment Account,  
* Issue transfers to third party payment accounts, 
* Receive and use a Brevo Payment Card associated to that Payment Account upon request.

**3.2.3.** The Client acknowledges that:  

* The amounts are at no time held by Brevo,

* 1.2% if the conversion is between the PSP’s standard FX currencies or;
* 3% if the conversion involves a non-standard FX currency. An updated list of standard FX currencies can be provided upon request. As a reference rate for foreign currencies (FX), the PSP uses Oanda’s daily FX intermediate rate (as published on www.oanda.com). In case of Charge Back, the Client will be debited only with the initial settlement amount received, in the initial currency of settlement, and the remainder of the initial transaction amount paid by the End Customer (in the initial currency of the transaction and, therefore, including currency conversion differences and/or related costs) will be supported by Brevo.

* The conditions under which these Pages and/or Payment Links are transmitted to third parties by the Client.

### **3.5. Security**

As part of the provision of its Payment Services, PSP implements specific security measures detailed in the Payment Service Provider Terms. 

Where relevant, each party will ensure adequate technical and procedural security measures are implemented with respect to their systems and in particular with respect to their interfaces to ensure system integrity and protection against unauthorized third-party access and use of data processed, expressly including payment transaction data and any personal data. Where PCI DSS or similar compliance standards are to be adhered to under applicable Scheme Rules, each party shall ensure it is and remains compliant and certified with respect to the relevant standards.

In accordance with the applicable laws on hacking and computer crime, Client shall only use the Payment Services for the purposes as agreed in the Agreement and shall specifically not perform or allow to be performed any actions detrimental to the security or performance of the Payment Services without Brevo’s prior written consent.

When required by PSP or by Applicable Laws, the Client shall apply or implement Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) at its own costs and by its own means when required by Applicable Law.

* When the use of the Payment Services by the Client presents a risk of fraud, 
* When the KYC documents provided by the Client are incomplete or incorrect or not up-to-date,
* When the Payment Page displays illicit or restricted products as detailed by the PSP at the following address: https://www.adyen.com/legal/list-restricted-prohibited and/or when the transactions carried out by means of the Payment Services concern these products, 

* At the request of the PSP in the event of a breach of its own general terms and conditions of use available at the following address: [https://www.adyen.com/legal/terms-and-conditions-adyen-for-platforms](https://www.adyen.com/legal/terms-and-conditions-adyen-for-platforms) and or of the Adyen Prohibited and Restricted Products and Services list available at [https://www.adyen.com/legal/list-restricted-prohibited](https://www.adyen.com/legal/list-restricted-prohibited);  

* At the request of the competent authorities. 

**4.2. Suspension criteria specific to the Card Services**

Brevo reserves the right to partly or fully suspend the provision of the Card Services  if, in Brevo’s reasonable discretion and due diligence:

* there is a material breach of the terms of this agreement, Applicable Law (including Scheme Rules) by the Client.

### SECTION 5. Obligations

**5.1. Lawfulness of the activity** 

The Client warrants that it shall perform its activities and use the Payment Services in accordance with Applicable Law.

The Client agrees and warrants it holds and will maintain all governmental, regulatory, or exchange licenses, registrations, authorizations, approvals, and other permission required under any Applicable Law or Scheme Rules for it to lawfully perform its obligations under this agreement.

**WARNING**: For violations of certain key requirements under the Scheme Rules by Brevo and/or the Client, some Scheme Owners can levy significant fines, ranging from 25.000 USD to over 1 million USD. The Scheme Owners do this to protect the paying customers, merchants and providers of the Payment Methods collectively against misuse, fraud, illegal activities, breach of applicable laws and excessive costs. Key examples of Scheme Rules which are subject to such fines: (i) using the payment method for other products and services for which the Client received no express authorization to use it for; (ii) using the payment method for products and services which are violating Applicable Laws; (iii) using the payment method for selling products and services for which the Scheme Owner explicitly prohibited its use (e.g. adult content, arms, drugs, counterfeit goods); (iv) Using the payment method for the benefit of a third party / reselling the use of the payment method to a third party (the authorization for the Client to use a payment method is strictly personal); (v) percentage of Payment Transactions of the Client which is subject to a Chargeback is above the applicable acceptable level; (vi) breaches of security and confidentiality obligations with respect to payment data and in particular details of credit cards used such as the CVC number or credit card number; (vii) fraudulent, misleading activities of which customers making payments are the victim. 

Where PSP or Brevo becomes aware of and/or received any notice of a potential exposure to a fine from the Scheme Owners related to any Client’s behavior, Client will on first request provide all reasonable co-operation to help investigate the relevant circumstances and remedy the relevant violation, notwithstanding all other rights and remedies of Brevo in such situation as per the Agreement. If fines are applied for Client’s violations, these are invoiced by the PSP to Brevo. Client shall fully indemnify and hold Brevo harmless from any fines applied by the Scheme Owners as a result of Client’s breach of the terms of this Agreement and related incurred reasonable legal fees and other costs.

**5.2. Monitoring** 

Brevo may monitor and/or verify Client’s procedures, processes and relevant other documentation relating to Client’s responsibilities pursuant to this agreement Client will reasonably cooperate with a request for information from Brevo without undue delay and accommodate verification by way of on-site or off-site audits, as may be reasonably determined necessary by Brevo. The Client will furthermore not limit or prevent a lawful or regulatory body, competent authority or Scheme Owner from exercising its rights under Applicable Law or Scheme Rules to conduct investigations, request information or perform audits in relation to the Payment Services.

**5.4. Notification**

Client must notify Brevo immediately (via API, or alternative mutually agreed process) in the following circumstances:

(i)   any request by Client to block a Card or fund transfer;

(ii)  any unauthorized payment or (potential) fraud or illegal or suspicious activity;

(iv) upon the occurrence of any event, or Client becoming aware of any information, that might materially impact the Client’s ability to perform its obligations towards Brevo or the PSP, or which might adversely affect Brevo’s or PSP’s business or its reputation in relation to the Payment Services;

(v) any material non-compliance to any Applicable Law or Scheme Rules that Client has become aware of or should have been reasonably aware of; or

(vi)   a complaint or criticism from a regulatory body or other third party or any legal action that may have a material effect on the Payment Services (collectively “Complaint”). Client shall share all relevant written documentation, to the extent not prohibited by Applicable Law.

**5.4. Support**

Brevo shall make its best efforts to provide first and second line support to the Client. First line support means a general help desk that takes more information, offers simple solutions, and determines if an issue requires escalation to someone with more expertise. Second line support means a team with more technical knowhow who can assist with more complex issues. Support can be requested at [\[email protected\]](https://www.sendinblue.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

### SECTION 6. Privacy and security

Where PSP processes personal data for the performance of the Payment Service, and specifically those for KYC purposes, it will do so in accordance with its privacy statement (available on www.adyen.com), and if and where applicable, act as an independent data controller in accordance with applicable privacy laws (including EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 “GDPR”). Where Brevo processes personal data for the performance of the Payment Service, Brevo shall do so in accordance with the Annex “DPA” of the Brevo Terms of Service. Brevo may process personal data as an independent controller in accordance with its privacy statement available at [https://www.brevo.com/legal/privacypolicy/](https://www.brevo.com/legal/privacypolicy/). 

Each party shall implement and maintain industry standard technical and organizational privacy and security measures to protect the Client’s personal data against unauthorized access or use. 

The Client will cooperate with Brevo’s and/or PSP’s assessment and provide accurate and complete information upon Brevo’s and/or PSP’s request. In the event of a (potential) breach of or unauthorized access to Personal Data (“Security Breach”), Client will notify Brevo within a timeframe that reasonably allows the other party to comply with its own obligations under Applicable Law, and in each case no later than 72 hours. Each Party will promptly take all necessary and appropriate actions to investigate, mitigate and remediate a Security Breach and its effects.

### SECTION 7. Data analytics and scoring

PSP and Brevo may use de-identified transaction-related data, which may also be aggregated data, for various purposes including but not limited to analyzing, tracking, and comparing transaction and other data to develop and provide insights for Client and/or other PSP’s customers as well as for developing, marketing, maintaining and/or improving PSP’s or Brevo’s products and services. To this end, PSP uses network analysis and machine learning models for the purpose of payment performance, gaining better insights, fraud prevention, risk assessment and for improving PSP’s products and services.

PSP’s Score service (or Score) uses such network analysis and machine learning models in order to identify and score fraudulent patterns in Client’s transactional behavior. The Score can be accessed by PSP and Brevo.

PSP will process personal data for the Score in accordance with the Adyen Privacy Policy (available at: https://www.adyen.com/policies-and-disclaimer/privacy-policy ).

Brevo reserves the right to cancel Transactions, at PSP’s discretion, that it has reasonable grounds to suspect to be fraudulent or involving other criminal activities, even if the fraud control tool failed to block the Payment Transaction. In this case, Brevo shall notify and inform Client about these grounds without undue delay after being notified by PSP.

### SECTION 8. Liability

**8.1.** The Client is solely responsible for the use of the Payment Services and in particular: 

* The information integrated into the Payment Pages, 
* The integration or sending of the Payment Pages and Payment Links on the Client’s website,  
* The use of the Payment Card, 
* The use of the Payment Account,
* Transactions made from the Payment Pages, Payment Links, Brevo Payment Card and Brevo Payment Account, 
* Compliance with the PSP Terms.

**8.2.** The Client will hold Brevo harmless against all damages, claims and actions of third parties resulting from intentional misconduct, negligence, or breach by the Client of this Agreement and/or of the PSP Terms.

**8.3.** The Client is informed that any use of the Payment Services in violation of this Agreement or the PSP Terms may result in the application of a criminal or administrative sanction to the PSP, who is solely responsible for the provision of the Payment Services.  In the event that the use of the Payment Services leads to the application of such sanction, the Client will hold Brevo against any claim by the PSP in this respect and will indemnify Brevo of any damage suffered as a result, provided that the damage is attributable to it. 

**8.4.** Brevo will not give advice to the Client about financial services provided by Brevo or by the PSP nor will Brevo mediate between the PSP and the Client for the provision of the Payment Services.

### SECTION 9. Specific cases of termination

Without prejudice to the termination grounds set out in the Terms and Conditions, Brevo may at any time terminate this agreement upon written notice to Client if and when:

* Brevo and/or PSP has reasonable suspicion that the Client is involved in, or facilitates, illegal or fraudulent activities;
* Brevo and/or PSP needs to do so in order to comply with Applicable Law or Scheme Rules, including relevant PCI-DSS regulation; or
* The provision of all or part of the Payment Service pursuant to this agreement poses a material risk to the reputation of Brevo, the PSP the Scheme Owners and/or the integrity of the payment system.

Except as expressly notified otherwise by Brevo, the termination of this Agreement shall not automatically terminate the Brevo Terms and Conditions or as the case may be any ongoing Order Forms. However, the termination for cause of this Agreement by Brevo allows Brevo to terminate the Brevo Terms and Conditions and/or as the case may be any ongoing Order Form(s).

### SECTION 10. Audit

In addition to any audit rights or ongoing provision of documentation and information obligations described herein, Client will reasonably cooperate with any request for information by Brevo or PSP, their auditors, regulatory authorities, or Scheme Owners, without undue delay. Brevo and/or PSP, its auditor, or any regulatory authority with oversight on Brevo or PSP’s services, during the term, may perform audit(s), which may require both off-site and on-site access, Client’s policies, procedures, software, technical connections, records and any other activity that relate to the Payment Service (“Audit”). Brevo and/or PSP will, when possible, provide at least 10 business days’ advance written notice of any Audit, starting from the communication of the audit plan by Brevo and/or PSP. Client will not limit or prevent Brevo, the PSP, a lawful body, regulatory body, competent authority, auditor, or Scheme Owner from exercising its rights to conduct investigations, request information, or perform Audits in relation to the Payment Service. Any Audit shall be conducted during normal business hours, and in a manner that reasonably minimizes interference with Client’s business. Client shall give all necessary assistance to the conduct of audits during the continuance of this agreement and for any period after termination of this agreement in accordance with Applicable Law. Any third-party audit costs will be borne by Brevo or the PSP, unless the audit reveals that Client has materially breached its obligations under this agreement, the Brevo Terms of Service, the Payment Service Provider Terms and/or Applicable Law.

### SECTION 11. Issuing of the card (section applicable to card services only)

Client agrees and complies with the current content of the Card User Terms at all times during the Client’s use of the Card Services.

**11.1. Issuing of physical card**

Client will provide Brevo with an order form or other written request as may be agreed by the Parties, when instructing Brevo to pass on to PSP the order to design and /or manufacture Cards (“Order”). The Order shall not be binding until accepted in writing by Brevo and Adyen. When Brevo instructs PSP on behalf of Client to manufacture Cards with a custom design (such as Client’s branding), the Cards must comply with the then-current Card design requirements applied by the relevant Scheme Owner. Brevo might provide available guidelines regarding Card design on request of the Client, depending on their communication by the PSP. Brevo expressly makes no warranties that a custom design complies with relevant guidelines nor that a custom design will be accepted by the relevant Scheme Owner. Brevo is not responsible or liable for costs or delays that result from a custom Card design not being accepted by the relevant Scheme Owner.

Brevo makes no warranties about communicated manufacturing or distribution timelines as these generally depend on external factors not within the control of Brevo or PSP, such as but not limited to, delays in manufacturing or distribution caused by the Card manufacturer. Client is responsible for monitoring and accounting for Card expiration. Client shall reach out to Brevo from time to time when it requires new Cards to an existing Card Program or replace existing Cards. At the time of such request Client and Brevo shall estimate the anticipated delivery time. Brevo is not responsible for managing the PSP’s manufacturing stock. Brevo accepts no responsibility or liability in connection with Card stock management or Card availability.

If the Client cancels an Order due to circumstances not within the control or responsibility of Brevo, the Client will reimburse Brevo the relevant design, manufacturing, distribution and third party (cancelation) costs incurred by Brevo as a result of the Order or cancelation thereof.

**11.2. Reversibility**

In the event of termination, Brevo will automatically cease the provision of Card Service to the Client. The Card remains the property of the PSP and must be returned or destroyed following the termination of the Card Service. 

The parties will cooperate in good faith to ensure the orderly wind-down or transition of the Card Service, including providing commercially reasonable transition support. 

Termination of this Agreement does not affect each party’s obligations under this Agreement, including the obligation to pay or procure payment of fees, costs, indemnified amounts or other financial obligations towards the other party based on, or resulting from, services rendered, or activities performed during the term of this Agreement. 

If at the time of termination, any Client’s obligations to Brevo or PSP remain in relation to the Card Service, the relevant provisions of this Agreement and the Card User Terms will survive such termination and remain in force until all obligations of the Client are fulfilled. Client accepts responsibility for any losses, claims, costs, or damages Brevo incurs.

Your monthly or annual payment is due on the date you sign up and billing for the following month or years will occur on the same date each month or year. 

If you downgrade or upgrade your plan level during a billing cycle, we will issue a credit note for the remaining prepaid amount on a pro-rata basis. The credit note will automatically be applied to your next invoice. 

You are required to maintain a valid payment method, such as debit or credit card information, on file with us. You authorize Brevo to charge your payment method for the amount due to Brevo for the Services, any sales and use taxes and any applicable late fees or interest. If your card is replaced for any reason, you authorize us to charge such replacement card for the amount due to Brevo for any Services. The person submitting the card for payment represents and warrants that they are authorized to use such card, that the card may be charged as agreed herein, and that such charges will not be rejected. You agree that you are solely liable for any payment or credit card fraud, abuse or unauthorized use by you or others. 

If we stop providing the service to you for any reason and terminate your account without cause, we will provide you a refund of the pro rata amount of the monthly or annual charge that was prepaid.  Otherwise, you won’t be entitled to a refund or credit for any reason.  

If you do not pay on time or if we cannot charge the payment method you have on file for any reason, we reserve the right to either suspend or terminate your access to the Services. In addition, if any payment is not received within 30 days after the due date, then we may charge a late fee of $10 and we may assess interest at the rate of 1.5% of the outstanding balance per month (18% per year), or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, from 30 days after the due date until the date paid. If your unpaid fees are referred to an attorney or collections agency, you shall pay all reasonable attorney’s fees or collections agency fees.

Brevo uses PCI DSS-compliant third party payment providers to process payments, including Adyen, PayPal, GoCardless, and Chargebee, and Brevo reserves the right to process payments using any provider. Your payment is subject to the terms and conditions imposed by the third-party payment provider.

**Maintenance and Planned Outages.** Brevo (ex Sendinblue) may limit or suspend the Services from time to time to perform scheduled maintenance or to stop a violation of this Agreement, to prevent material harm to Brevo (ex Sendinblue) or its customers or as required by applicable law. Brevo (ex Sendinblue) will endeavor to give Customer reasonable advance notice of any limitation or suspension so that Customer can plan around it, or address the issue that has prompted Brevo (ex Sendinblue) to take such action. There may be some situations, such as security emergencies, where it is not practicable for Brevo (ex Sendinblue) to give such advance notice. Brevo (ex Sendinblue) will use commercially reasonable efforts to narrow the scope and duration of the limitation or suspension as is needed to resolve the issue that prompted such action.

**Assignment.**  You may not assign, delegate, or transfer these Terms, or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your subscription or other use of the Services, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without prior written consent from Brevo (ex Sendinblue). Any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.

**Class Action Waiver.** YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO COMMENCE OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST SENDINBLUE RELATED TO ANY CLAIM, DISPUTE OR CONTROVERSY, AND, WHERE APPLICABLE, YOU HEREBY AGREE TO OPT OUT OF ANY CLASS PROCEEDING AGAINST SENDINBLUE OTHERWISE COMMENCED.

**Arbitration Agreement.** Please read this section carefully. This section affects rights that you may otherwise have. It provides for resolution of most disputes through arbitration instead of court trials and class actions.

YOU AGREE TO GIVE UP ANY RIGHTS TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN A COURT OR BEFORE A JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS ACCESS TO DISCOVERY, ALSO MAY BE UNAVAILABLE OR LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.

Any claim or dispute brought by you arising from or relating to these Terms, or to the relationships that result from these Terms, including disputes about the validity, scope, or enforceability of this arbitration provision (collectively, “Covered Disputes”) may, at Brevo (ex Sendinblue)’s option and in its sole discretion, be settled exclusively by binding, individual arbitration, rather than in court, and to be held in King County, Washington, or another location mutually agreeable to the parties. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association under its rules and procedures. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. Prior to initiating any arbitration, you will give Brevo (ex Sendinblue) at least 60 days’ advanced written notice of your intent to file for arbitration.  You must provide such notice by email to [\[email protected\]](https://www.sendinblue.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). During such 60-day notice period, the parties will endeavor to settle amicably by mutual discussions any Covered Disputes. Failing such amicable settlement and expiration of the notice period, either party may initiate arbitration. The arbitrator will have the power to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity, and any award of the arbitrator(s) will be final and binding on each of the parties. Judgment upon the award rendered by an arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms, and the failure to do so will be deemed an excess of arbitral authority and grounds for judicial review. You are not entitled to arbitrate any Covered Dispute as a class, representative, or private attorney action, and the arbitrator(s) will have no authority to proceed on a class, representative, or private attorney general basis. If any provision of the agreement to arbitrate in this section is found illegal or unenforceable, the remaining arbitration terms shall continue to be fully valid, binding, and enforceable (but in no case will there be a class, representative, or private attorney general arbitration). These Terms and related transactions will be subject to and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sec. 1-16 (FAA) and, where otherwise applicable, by the laws of the State of Washington. Brevo reserves all rights to pursue any and all claims and remedies, whether in a court of law or other tribunal, and in no way shall the foregoing be interpreted to limit Brevo (ex Sendinblue)’s rights in this regard. 

**General.** No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Brevo (ex Sendinblue) as a result of these Terms or your use of the Services. If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect. You hereby consent to Brevo (ex Sendinblue) publicizing the existence (but not the terms) of the relationship contemplated hereunder as a part of Brevo (ex Sendinblue)’s promotional and marketing activities from time to time. These Terms, along with the agreements incorporated by reference herein, constitute the entire agreement between Brevo (ex Sendinblue) and you with respect to your access to and use of the Services and your Brevo (ex Sendinblue) account, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether oral or written, between Brevo (ex Sendinblue) and you with respect thereto and, with respect to your use of the Services, supersedes the terms of any other party’s terms and conditions. These Terms may be executed by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, as applicable to the Services, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original for all purposes, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument. The failure of Brevo (ex Sendinblue) to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

**Consent to Do Business Electronically.** By accessing our Services, subscribing with us, creating a Brevo (ex Sendinblue) account, typing your name into any of our electronic forms and indicating your acceptance, or submitting information by clicking a box, you consent to (a) Brevo (ex Sendinblue) communicating with you electronically; (b) receiving all applications, notices, disclosures and authorizations (collectively, “Records”) from Brevo (ex Sendinblue) electronically; and (c) entering into agreements and transactions using electronic Records and signatures. Please note that federal law treats electronic signatures as having the same legal force and effect as if they were signed on paper by hand, and online contracts have the same legal force as signing an equivalent paper contract in ink. Brevo (ex Sendinblue) will use electronic documents for all communications, agreements, disclosures, authorizations, and other documents necessary to provide you with the Services. You must have a computer or other web-enabled device, a connection to the internet, an active email account, and the ability to receive and read electronic files to conduct business with us electronically. You agree to be responsible for keeping your own Records. You may print or download Records from the Services and keep them for your own reference. If you require assistance with your Records, wish to receive Records in paper format, or wish to withdraw your consent to receiving electronic Records from us, please contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.sendinblue.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Agreements and transactions executed prior to this request will remain valid and enforceable.

**Modification of Terms of Use.** Brevo (ex Sendinblue) reserves the right to revise these Terms of Use by updating the Terms of Use posted to its website without prior notice.  Your continued use of our Services following the posting of changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes. You are advised to periodically visit this page to determine the then current Terms of Use.
