Welcome to iCloud
=================

THIS LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND APPLE GOVERNS YOUR USE OF THE iCLOUD PRODUCT, SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND WEBSITES (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE “SERVICE”). IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU READ AND UNDERSTAND THE FOLLOWING TERMS. BY CLICKING “AGREE,” YOU ARE AGREEING THAT THESE TERMS WILL APPLY IF YOU CHOOSE TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE.

Apple is the provider of the Service, which permits you to utilize certain Internet services, including storing your personal content (such as contacts, calendars, photos, notes, reminders, documents, app data, and iCloud email) and making it accessible on your compatible devices and computers, and certain location based services, only under the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. iCloud is automatically enabled when you are running devices on iOS 9 or later and sign in with your Apple ID during device setup, unless you are upgrading the device and have previously chosen not to enable iCloud. You can disable iCloud in Settings. When iCloud is enabled, your content will be automatically sent to and stored by Apple, so you can later access that content or have content wirelessly pushed to your other iCloud-enabled devices or computers. 

**I. REQUIREMENTS FOR USE OF THE SERVICE**

**A. Age.** The Service is only available to individuals aged 13 years or older (or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction), unless you are under 13 years old and your Apple ID was provided to you as a result of a request by an approved educational institution or established as part of the Family Sharing feature by your parent or guardian. We do not knowingly collect, use or disclose personal information from children under 13, or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction, without verifiable parental consent.  Parents and guardians should also remind any minors that conversing with strangers on the Internet can be dangerous and take appropriate precautions to protect children, including monitoring their use of the Service.

To use the Service, you cannot be a person barred from receiving the Service under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdictions, including the country in which you reside or from where you use the Service. By accepting this Agreement, you represent that you understand and agree to the foregoing.

**B. Devices and Accounts.** Use of the Service may require compatible devices, Internet access, and certain software (fees may apply); may require periodic updates; and may be affected by the performance of these factors. Apple reserves the right to limit the number of Accounts that may be created from a device and the number of devices associated with an Account. The latest version of required software may be required for certain transactions or features. You agree that meeting these requirements is your responsibility. 

**C. Limitations on Use.**  You agree to use the Service only for purposes permitted by this Agreement, and only to the extent permitted by any applicable law, regulation, or generally accepted practice in the applicable jurisdiction. Your Account is allocated 5GB of storage capacity as described in the iCloud feature pages. Additional storage is available for purchase, as described below. Exceeding any applicable or reasonable limitation of bandwidth, or storage capacity (for example, backup or email account space) is prohibited and may prevent you from backing up to iCloud, adding documents, or receiving new email sent to your iCloud email address. If your use of the Service or other behavior intentionally or unintentionally threatens Apple’s ability to provide the Service or other systems, Apple shall be entitled to take all reasonable steps to protect the Service and Apple’s systems, which may include suspension of your access to the Service. Repeated violations of the limitations may result in termination of your Account.

If you are a covered entity, business associate or representative of a covered entity or business associate (as those terms are defined at 45 C.F.R § 160.103), You agree that you will not use any component, function or other facility of iCloud to create, receive, maintain or transmit any “protected health information” (as such term is defined at 45 C.F.R § 160.103) or use iCloud in any manner that would make Apple (or any Apple Subsidiary) Your or any third party’s business associate.

**D. Availability of the Service.** The Service, or any feature or part thereof, may not be available in all languages or in all countries and Apple makes no representation that the Service, or any feature or part thereof, is appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to access and use the Service, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with any applicable laws.

**E. Changing the Service.** Apple reserves the right at any time to modify this Agreement and to impose new or additional terms or conditions on your use of the Service, provided that Apple will give you 30 days’ advance notice of any material adverse change to the Service or applicable terms of service, unless it would not be reasonable to do so due to circumstances arising from legal, regulatory, or governmental action; to address user security, user privacy, or technical integrity concerns; to avoid service disruptions to other users; or due to a natural disaster, catastrophic event, war, or other similar occurrence outside of Apple’s reasonable control. With respect to paid cloud storage services, Apple will not make any material adverse change to the Service before the end of your current paid term, unless a change is reasonably necessary to address legal, regulatory, or governmental action; to address user security, user privacy, or technical integrity concerns; to avoid service disruptions to other users; or to avoid issues resulting from a natural disaster, a catastrophic event, war, or other similar occurrence outside of Apple’s reasonable control. In the event that Apple does make material adverse changes to the Service or terms of use, you will have the right to terminate this Agreement and your account, in which case Apple will provide you with a pro rata refund of any pre-payment for your then-current paid term. Apple shall not be liable to you for any modifications to the Service or terms of service made in accordance with this Section IE.

**II. FEATURES AND SERVICES**

**A. Use of Location-based Services**

Apple and its partners and licensors may provide certain features or services that rely upon device-based location information using GPS (or similar technology, where available) and crowdsourced Wi-Fi access points and cell tower locations. To provide such features or services, where available, Apple and its partners and licensors must collect, use, transmit, process and maintain your location data, including but not limited to the geographic location of your device and information related to your iCloud account (“Account”) and any devices registered thereunder, including but not limited to your Apple ID, device ID and name, and device type. 

You may withdraw consent to Apple and its partners’ and licensors’ collection, use, transmission, processing and maintenance of location and Account data at any time by not using the location-based features and turning off Find My (including the predecessor apps Find My iPhone and Find My Friends, collectively referred to as “Find My”), or Location Services in Settings (as applicable) on your device. When using third party services that use or provide location data as part of the Service, you are subject to and should review such third party’s terms and privacy policy on use of location data by such third party services. Any location data provided by the Service is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may lead to death, personal injury, property or environmental damage. Apple shall use reasonable skill and due care in providing the Service, but neither Apple nor any of its service and/or content providers guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of location data or any other data displayed by the Service. LOCATION-BASED SERVICES ARE NOT INTENDED OR SUITABLE FOR USE AS AN EMERGENCY LOCATOR SYSTEM.

**B. Find My**

When you enable iCloud and Location Services on a device running iOS 13, iPad OS or macOS Catalina or later, Find My (Find My iPhone for devices running iOS 8 through iOS 12) will be enabled automatically on that device and any Apple accessories paired with it. Once enabled, your device will be automatically linked to your Apple ID and your Apple ID password will be required before anyone (including you) can turn off Find My, sign out of iCloud, erase or activate the device.  Apple and its authorized agents may not perform hardware or software support services, including services under Apple’s limited warranty, unless you disable Find My prior to service.  Apple shall bear no responsibility for your failure to protect your iOS device with a passcode, enable Lost Mode, and/or receive or respond to notices and communications.  Apple shall also bear no responsibility for returning your iOS device to you or for any loss of data on your iOS device.

Offline Finding is a crowdsourcing feature that can help you and others locate missing devices when those devices are not connected to the internet. If Offline Finding is enabled on a device, it can detect the presence of nearby offline devices via Bluetooth (or similar technologies). If a device detects a missing offline device, it will use Wi-Fi or cellular connections to securely report the approximate location of the device back to the Apple ID associated with the device so the owner can view its location in the Find My app. Location reporting is end-to-end encrypted, and Apple cannot see the location of the reporting device or any offline device. You can disable Offline Finding in Settings.

**C. Backup**

iCloud Backup periodically creates automatic backups for iOS devices, when the device is screen locked, connected to a power source, and connected to the Internet via a Wi-Fi network. If a device has not backed up to iCloud for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days, Apple reserves the right to delete any backups associated with that device. Backup may include device settings, device characteristics, photos and videos, documents, your messages, ringtones, Health app data and other app data. For additional information, please go to [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207428](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207428). The following content is not included in your iCloud backup: content purchased from the iTunes Store, App Store, or Apple Books, media synced from your computer, and your photo library if you have enabled iCloud Photo Library. Apple shall use reasonable skill and due care in providing the Service, but, TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW, APPLE DOES NOT GUARANTEE OR WARRANT THAT ANY CONTENT YOU MAY STORE OR ACCESS THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO INADVERTENT DAMAGE, CORRUPTION, LOSS, OR REMOVAL IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND APPLE SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE SHOULD SUCH DAMAGE, CORRUPTION, LOSS, OR REMOVAL OCCUR. It is your responsibility to maintain appropriate alternate backup of your information and data.

**D. Photos**

**1.  iCloud Photos.** When you enable iCloud Photos, your photos, videos, metadata and any edits that you make in the Photos App on your iOS device, macOS computer, or Windows PC will be automatically uploaded and stored in iCloud, and then pushed to all of your other iCloud Photos-enabled devices and computers. The photo and video resolution may vary depending on your device settings and available storage. You may download full resolution photos and videos at any time.

**2. Shared Albums.**  When you use Shared Albums, Apple stores any photos and videos you share until you delete them. You can access your shared photos and videos from any of your Apple devices that have Shared Albums enabled. People you invite to shared albums may view, save, copy, and share these photos and videos, as well as contribute photos and videos, and comments.  If you choose to use Shared Albums to share photos via a web link, these photos will be publicly available to anyone who has been provided or has access to the web link. If you want to stop sharing individual photos, videos, comments or entire Shared Albums, you may delete them at any time. However, any content previously copied from a Shared Album to another device or computer will not be deleted. 

**3. My Photo Stream.** When you use My Photo Stream, Apple stores photos taken on your iOS device or uploaded from your computer for a limited period of time and automatically pushes the photos to your other Apple devices that have My Photo Stream enabled. A limited number of photos may be stored in iCloud or on your devices at any one time, and older photos will be automatically deleted from My Photo Stream over time. To keep these photos permanently, you must save them to the camera roll on your iOS device or the photo library on your computer.

**E. Family Sharing.** With Family Sharing, you can share certain purchased content such as Store purchases and Apple subscriptions with members of your family. You may also share certain content such as photos, calendars, location, and screen time information depending on what your family chooses to share. For more information regarding sharing your content purchases, please see the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions at [https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/ww/](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/ww/). For more information about sharing content, device usage and location information with family members, please see [https://www.apple.com/family-sharing/](https://www.apple.com/family-sharing/)

**F. File Sharing.** When you use iCloud File Sharing, Apple stores any files you share until you delete them. You can access your shared files from any of your Apple devices with iCloud Drive enabled. You may give access to people to view, save, copy or edit these files. You have the option to give people the right to edit the files or to only view them. If you use iCloud File Sharing to share files via a web link, these files will be publicly accessible to anyone who has been provided the web link. You can stop sharing files at any time. If you stop sharing, files will be removed from iCloud Drive on everyone’s devices. However, any file previously copied to another device or computer will not be deleted.

**G. Mail Drop.** If you are logged in to iCloud and you use the macOS Mail app or iCloud Mail on the web to send emails with large attachments, you will have the option of using Mail Drop. With Mail Drop, your large attachments will be temporarily stored on iCloud servers in order to facilitate their delivery. Apple will either send a link or a preview of the attachment to recipients, depending on your recipient’s email client application. Temporary storage of large email attachments will not count towards your iCloud storage quota. For more information about Mail Drop, please go to [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203093](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203093).

**H. Third Party Apps.** If you sign in to certain third party Apps with your iCloud credentials, you agree to allow that App to store data in your personal iCloud account and for Apple to collect, store and process such data on behalf of the relevant third-party App Developer in association with your use of the Service and such Apps. The data that the App stores in your personal iCloud account will count towards your storage limit.  Such data may be shared with another App that you download from the same App Developer. 

**I. iCloud web-only account.** If you sign up for the Service with a web-only account on a non-Apple-branded device or computer, you will have access to only a limited set of Service functionality. You will receive 1 GB of free storage and you will not be able to increase this amount with a web-only account. As a condition to accessing the Service with a web-only account, you agree to all relevant terms and conditions found in this Agreement, including, without limitation, all requirements for use of the Service, limitations on use, availability, public beta, disclaimers of warranties, rules regarding your content and conduct, and termination. Terms found in this Agreement relating to features not available for web-only users will not be applicable to you. These include, for example, use of location based services and payment of fees for iCloud storage upgrades. You further agree that if you subsequently access your web-only account from an Apple-branded device or Apple-branded computer, whether or not you own such device or computer, Apple may automatically upgrade your web-only account to a full iCloud account and provide all available functionality of the Service to you, including increased free storage capacity. If you choose to access your web-only account from an Apple-branded device or Apple-branded computer and you are subsequently upgraded to full functionality of the Service, you agree that all of the terms and conditions contained herein apply to your use of the Service. If you do not want to have a full iCloud account, do not sign in to your web-only account from an Apple-branded device or computer.

**J. Two-Factor Authentication and Autodialed Calls/Texts.** If you choose to enable Two-Factor Authentication for your Apple ID, you consent to (a) provide Apple at least one telephone number; and (b) receive autodialed or prerecorded calls and text messages from Apple at any of the telephone numbers provided. We may place such calls or texts to (i) help keep your Account secure when signing in; (ii) help you access your Account when you’ve forgotten your password; or (iii) as otherwise necessary to service your Account or enforce this Agreement, our policies, applicable law, or any other agreement we may have with you.

**III. SUBSCRIPTION STORAGE UPGRADES**

Additional storage is available for purchase on a subscription basis.

**A. Payment**

By upgrading your storage on your device or computer, Apple will automatically charge on a recurring basis the storage fee for the storage plan you choose, including any applicable taxes, to the payment method associated with your Apple ID (e.g., the payment method you use to shop on the iTunes Store, App Store, or Apple Books, if available) or the payment method associated with your Family account. For details about storage plans and pricing, please visit [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201238](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201238). If you are a Family organizer, you agree to have Apple charge your payment method on a recurring basis for members of your Family who upgrade their storage. Apple may also obtain preapproval for an amount up to the amount of the transaction and contact you periodically by email to the email address associated with your Apple ID for billing reminders and other storage account-related communications.  

You can change your subscription by upgrading or downgrading your storage under the iCloud section of Settings on your device, or under the iCloud pane of System Preferences on your Mac or iCloud for Windows on your PC.

The applicable storage fee for an upgraded storage plan will take effect immediately; downgrades to your storage plan will take effect on the next annual or monthly billing date. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TIMELY PAYMENT OF ALL FEES AND FOR PROVIDING APPLE WITH VALID CREDIT CARD OR PAYMENT ACCOUNT DETAILS FOR PAYMENT OF ALL FEES. If Apple is unable to successfully charge your credit card or payment account for fees due, Apple reserves the right to revoke or restrict access to your stored Content, delete your stored Content, or terminate your Account. If you want to designate a different credit card or payment account or if there is a change in your credit card or payment account status, you must change your information online in the Account Information section of iCloud; this may temporarily disrupt your access to the Services while Apple verifies your new payment information. We may contact you via email regarding your account, for reasons including, without limitation, reaching or exceeding your storage limit. 

If you are in Brazil, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary:

For any charges made by Apple to you, Apple may use an affiliated company to perform activities of collection and remittances to charge any amounts owed by you in connection with your iCloud account.  In addition, your total price will include the price of the upgrade plus any applicable credit card fees. You are responsible for any taxes applicable to you except for any applicable withholding taxes which shall be collected by Apple’s affiliated company. You must provide all account information required by Apple to enable such transactions. You acknowledge and agree that if you do not provide all required account information, Apple shall have the right to terminate your account_._
