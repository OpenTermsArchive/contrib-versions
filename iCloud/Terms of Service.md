Apple and its partners and licensors may provide certain features or services (e.g., Find My iPhone, Find My Friends) that rely upon device-based location information using GPS (where available) and crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower locations. To provide such features or services, where available, Apple and its partners and licensors must collect, use, transmit, process and maintain your location data, including but not limited to the geographic location of your device and information related to your iCloud account (“Account”) and any devices registered thereunder, including but not limited to your Apple ID, device ID and name, and device type.

Backup is limited to device settings, device characteristics, photos and videos, documents, messages (iMessage, SMS, and MMS), ringtones, app data (including Health app data), location settings (such as location-based reminders that you have set up), and Home screen and app organization. Content purchased from the iTunes Store, App Store, or iBookstore is not backed up, but may be eligible for download from those services, subject to account requirements, availability, and the applicable terms and conditions. Media synced from your computer is not backed up. Your iCloud email, contacts, calendars, bookmarks, and documents are stored in, and can be accessed via iCloud on your devices and computers.
