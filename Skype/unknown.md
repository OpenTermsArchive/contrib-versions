**2.1 No Emergency Calls.** The Skype Software does not support any emergency calls to any type of hospitals, law enforcement agencies, medical care unit or any type of emergency services of any kind, except in the very limited circumstances described in paragraph 2.3 below. Skype is not a traditional telephone service or a replacement for Your primary telephone service. There are important differences between traditional telephone services and the Skype Software and the Skype Products. You need to make additional arrangements in order to access emergency services. It is Your responsibility to purchase, separately from the Skype Software and the Skype Products, traditional wireless or fixed line telephone services that offer access to emergency services. It is Your responsibility to inform Your Users that it is not possible to support or carry emergency calls using the Skype Software and the Skype Products, and that they may access emergency services via the additional arrangements that You have made available to Your Users. Find out more about calling 112, the dedicated emergency number for the EU at www.skype.com/go/emergency.

**2.2 Not a Standalone Service.** Business Products that enable communications via Your PBX and any other certified Skype Connect equipment should not be used as a standalone service but as a secondary communications channel only in connection with traditional telephone services. When using Business Products You shall configure Your PBX and any other certified Skype Connect equipment so that all emergency calls are terminated through a standard landline connection or some other type of telephone services that support emergency calling.

**2.3 Limited Emergency Calling:** Skype will use reasonable endeavours to provide limited emergency calling in a very limited number of countries, and only where a Business Account is being used for Individual Use by a Business User who is using the Skype Software version 4.1 for Windows (or later) or version 3.0 for Mac OS X (or later) (“ Enabled Versions”). Skype does not provide emergency calling for or in conjunction with any Business Products, Skype Products or on any platforms, devices or operating systems other than those Enabled Versions explicitly referred to in this paragraph 2.3. The following limitations apply in respect of emergency calling on Enabled Versions:

**2.3.1** Skype cannot guarantee that the emergency calling will always function without disruptions, delay or other imperfections, or at all. Where enabled, emergency calling will be transmitted through public Internet lines and the public switched telephone network ("PSTN"). Consequently, there may be power outages or Internet service disruption and You may experience some disruptions e.g. packet loss and delay which will interfere with the quality of Your communication. Furthermore, Skype cannot guarantee that You or Your Business Users will always be able to communicate with other people, nor can Skype guarantee that You or Your Business Users can communicate without disruptions, delays or communication-related flaws or that all Your communications shall always be delivered to other people. Any of these limitations may adversely affect successful call connection.

**2.3.2** An emergency call made using the Enabled Versions of Skype Software, in an enabled country may not receive the same network priority as a call made using traditional wireless (mobile) or fixed line telephone services.

**2.3.3** if the emergency call of a Business User is connected, such Business User will be required orally to provide their physical location to a third party emergency services operative to enable the correct emergency organisation to respond to the emergency. If the Business User does not provide this information when prompted, You acknowledge that the emergency call of Your Business User may not be completed and such Business User will not be able to gain access to the required emergency service using their Business Account. Skype will have no liability for any failed emergency call in such circumstances.

**2.3.4** You expressly acknowledge the service limitations described above and agree to continue to make alternative arrangements in order for Your Business Users to access emergency services through a traditional wireless (mobile) or fixed line telephone service, and only use emergency calling in the Enabled Versions of Skype Software as an absolute last resort.

**2.3.5** You can find out whether limited emergency calling functionality is available in the country in which Your Business Users are located by setting the default location for emergency calling in the Call Settings page of the applicable Business Account that is using one of the Enabled Versions of the Skype Software. It is Your responsibility to ensure that this location information is correct and kept up-to-date if the physical address of Your Business User changes. Emergency calls are not supported by the Skype Software in the majority of countries around the world. If the countries in which Your Business Users are located are not supported for limited emergency calling access then the provisions of paragraphs 2.1 and 13.1.3(A) continue to apply and You should ensure that Your Business Users do not attempt to, and agree not to, make any emergency calls using the Skype Software.

**2.3.6** You acknowledge and agree that it is Your responsibility to inform, and You shall inform, Your Business Users about the service limitations and the obligations referred to in paragraph 2.3.5 above regarding the Call Settings page of their Business Account.

**3\. Quality, Technical Improvement and Maintenance**

**3.1 Quality:** Skype will use reasonable endeavours to provide the Skype Products with minimum disruptions. However, Skype cannot guarantee that the Skype Products will always function without disruptions, delay or other imperfections. Since the Skype Products will be transmitted through public internet lines and the public switched telephone network ("**PSTN**"), there may be power outages or internet service disruption and You may experience some disruptions e.g. packet loss and delay which will interfere with the quality of Your communications.

**3.2 Technical improvement and maintenance:** Skype may change technical features in order to keep pace with the latest demands and technological developments or to comply with any Applicable Laws. Skype may also have to repair, improve, and/or upgrade the Skype Products and this may require us to restrict, limit, suspend, interfere and/or interrupt the Skype Products at any time in our sole discretion.

**4\. License and Restrictions**

**4.1 License.** Subject to Your compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Skype hereby grants You a non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free, non-transferable license to download, install and use the Skype Software with Your Business Accounts solely for Your own communication purposes including the individual communication purposes of Your Business Users.

(b) transfer, sublicense, lease, lend, rent or otherwise distribute the Skype Software. You acknowledge and agree that portions of the Skype Software, including, without limitation, the source code and the specific design and structure of individual modules or programs, constitute or contain trade secrets of Skype and its licensors. Accordingly, you agree not to disassemble, decompile or otherwise reverse engineer the Skype Software, in whole or in part, or permit or authorize a third party to do so, except to the extent such activities are expressly permitted by law notwithstanding this prohibition.

**4.5 Jurisdiction Restrictions.** If the law of Your country prohibits You, Your Administrators and/or Your Business Users from downloading or using the Skype Software because the Skype Software is not allowed in the country or countries in which Your entity or Business Users are located, please do not (and do not allow Your Administrators and Business Users to) use it.

**4.6** The Skype Software may be downloaded, installed and used on various products, applications or programs that are made available by third parties. Skype cannot guarantee that the Skype Software shall always be available on the product, application or program onto which You, Your Administrators or Business Users initially downloaded and installed it.

**5\. Skype Manager and Business Accounts**

**5.1 Purpose of Skype Manager.** A Skype Manager enables You to manage Your business communications.

**5.4 Reallocation and Deletion of Business Accounts.** If a Business Account has been allocated to a specific Business User for Individual Use and that Business User leaves the Company, such Business Account shall remain in the Skype Manager and may be allocated to another Business User. You may delete such Business Account from the Skype Manager rather than reallocate it to another Business User. If You choose to delete such Business Account then You acknowledge that the traffic data (including call history and text message history) in respect of a Business Account is only visible whilst that Business Account exists and such traffic data will no longer be accessible to You once that Business Account has been deleted, and You are therefore responsible for printing out the traffic data records if You deem this necessary, before deleting the relevant Business Account. Any Skype Numbers and Skype Credit that You have allocated to that Business Account may be taken back to the Skype Manager and reallocated before the Business Account is deleted. You may take the Skype Numbers back by manually removing them from the Business Account.

**5.5.3. Security.** You shall (and shall ensure that Your Administrators and Business Users shall) take all necessary steps to ensure the security of the User ID, Password and email address of Business Accounts at all times. If You suspect that any Password has been shared in breach of this Agreement or has become known to anyone other than an Administrator or a Business User to whom the Password has been allocated, then You shall ensure that such Password is immediately changed in order to protect Your Business Accounts. It is Your responsibility to ensure that Your Business Users and Administrators do not respond to any unsolicited requests for credit card details, Passwords or other data. Neither Skype nor its officers, employees or Affiliates may be held liable whether in contract, warranty, tort (including negligence), or any other form of liability for any claim, damage, or loss arising from or relating to any failure by You, Your Administrators and/or Business Users to comply with this paragraph 5.5.3.

**5.6 Administrator(s)** You and Your Administrators may appoint additional Administrators to Your Skype Manager, and each Administrator shall be required to accept and agree to this Agreement, the Business TOS and any other applicable Additional Terms. You shall procure that all Administrators read, agree to and comply with this Agreement, the Business TOS and any other applicable Additional Terms, and You shall be responsible for any breach of the Terms by such Administrator(s).

Allocating an unauthorised number as a CLI shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement and may result in criminal and civil liability against You. CLI is not available in all countries and Skype does not guarantee that the landline number allocated shall be shown as a CLI at all times.

**5.8 Purchase of Skype Products.** Business Users cannot purchase any Skype Products themselves. All Skype Products must be purchased by You and allocated to a Business Account in accordance with this Agreement.
