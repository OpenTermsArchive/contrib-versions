Skype is a community, and members of a community must respect each other as human beings. Skype therefore asks you not to get involved in any unwanted profane, offensive, obscene or sexual exchanges or to attempt to harm a young person in any way.

Please go to Inhope’s site if you would like information on reporting illegal use and content on the internet.

Skype asks that you do not:

*   Use vulgar, profane, offensive or obscene language.
*   Post or request sexually explicit images or other offensive content.
*   Exploit a minor in any way.
*   Use racially, religiously or sexually offensive language.
*   Discuss illegal activity, such as how to get drugs and how to make bombs.
*   Ask for or offer sexually explicit images, and/or material harmful to children.
*   Harass, threaten, embarrass, or do anything else to another Skype user that is unwanted.
*   Infringe anyone else's intellectual property rights, including but not limited to any copyright, trademark, rights of publicity, or other proprietary rights.
