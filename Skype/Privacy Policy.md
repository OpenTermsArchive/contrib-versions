Skype Privacy Statement This privacy statement applies to Skype’s websites, software and products. Please note that Skype is now part of Microsoft. It does not apply to other Microsoft websites, products, and services that do not display or link to this privacy statement.  
  
Please read the summaries below and click on "Learn More" for more details on a particular topic. Some features mentioned in this statement may not be available in all versions of the Skype software or in all markets.  
  
You can find more information on Microsoft's commitment to protecting your privacy at http://www.microsoft.com/privacy Cookies Most Microsoft Sites use "cookies," small text files that can be read by a web server in the domain that put the cookie on your hard drive. We may use cookies to store your preferences and settings. help with sign-in. provide targeted ads. and analyze site operations. Click here to learn more . CookiesCookies

Skype websites and software use "cookies", which are small text files stored on your device, to help operate the websites and software and collect information about activity. For instance, we use cookies to store your preferences and settings. help with sign-in. provide targeted ads, content and marketing communications. combat fraud. and analyze site operations. By using Skype’s websites and/or software you are giving your consent to the use of cookies. If you sign into Skype or other Microsoft products using a Microsoft account or Skype account, we will set or read one or more additional cookies. 

We also use web beacons to help deliver cookies and compile analytics. These include web beacons from third-party service providers.

You have a variety of tools to control cookies and similar technologies, including:

*   Browser controls to block and delete cookies; 
*   Advertising controls, including Microsoft's controls at http://choice.live.com/advertisementchoice/, to opt out of receiving behaviorally targeted ads. and
*   Controls from some analytics service providers to opt out of data collection through web beacons.

Skype websites and software use "cookies", which are small text files stored on your device, to help operate the websites and software and help collect information about activity. The text in a cookie often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your computer, but it may contain other information as well.  Here is an example of a unique ID number stored in a cookie that we might place on your device when you visit one of our websites: E3732CA7E319442F97EA48A170C99801.  Our websites also contain web beacons or other similar technologies.  We use cookies and similar technologies for a variety of purposes, as described in more detail below.  
  

 **Our Use of Cookies**

 We use cookies for several purposes, including:

*   **Storing your Preferences and Settings and Personalization.** We store information about the version of the Skype software you are using, your choice of language for our website or your choice of currency for our prices in a cookie on your device so that you will see the relevant information when you return. This can save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information every time you visit our websites or use the software. We also use cookies to understand how you arrived at our website or software so we can make sure that we provide you with relevant customer content and information.
*   **Sign-in and Authentication.** When you sign in to a site or service using your Microsoft or Skype account, we store a unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your device. This allows you to move from page to page at the site or within the service without having to sign in again on each page.
*   **Targeted Advertising.** When we display online advertisements to you, we will place one or more cookies on your device in order to recognize it each time we display an ad to you. Because we serve advertisements on the websites of our advertising and publisher partners, as well as our own, we are able to compile information over time about the types of pages, content and ads you, or others who are using your computer, visited or viewed. This information helps us select the ads we show you.  For example, it helps us try to ensure that you do not see the same advertisements repeatedly. It also helps us select and display targeted advertisements that we believe may be of interest to you. You can find more information about this use of cookies, including how to opt out of receiving targeted advertising from Microsoft, in the Microsoft Advertising Privacy Statement.
*   **Site Analytics.** We use cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a web page or service or to develop other aggregate statistics about the operations of our websites, software and products. These analytics help us operate and improve the performance of these websites, software, products and our marketing communications.  
      
    

Some of the cookies we commonly use are listed in the following chart. This list is not exhaustive, but it is intended to illustrate the main reasons we set cookies.

  

**Cookie name**

**Description**

MUID

Identifies unique browsers visiting Microsoft websites. It is used for advertising, site analytics and other operational purposes.

ANON

Contains the ANID, a unique identifier used to help identify which ads a customer may like. It is also used to preserve your choice to opt out of behaviorally targeted ads from Microsoft, if you have chosen to associate the opt-out with your Microsoft account.

CC

Contains a country code as determined by reverse IP address lookup.

Microsoft account authentication

Authentication cookies (e.g., RPSTAuth, MSNRPSAuth, KievRPSAuth) used when you sign in with your Microsoft account.

NAP

Contains an encrypted version of your country, ZIP code, age, gender, language and occupation, if known, based on your Microsoft account profile.

MH

Appears on co-branded websites where Microsoft is partnering with an advertiser. This cookie identifies the advertiser so the right ad is selected.

TOptOut

Records your decision not to receive behaviorally targeted ads delivered by Microsoft.

In addition to the cookies set when you visit our websites or use Skype software, third parties may also set cookies when you visit Microsoft websites. In some cases, that is because we have hired the third party to provide services on our behalf, such as site analytics. In other cases, it is because our web pages or software contain content or ads delivered by other ad networks. Because your browser connects to those third parties’ web servers to retrieve that content, those third parties are able to set or read their own cookies on your device and may collect information about your online activities across websites or online services.  
  

**Our Use of Web Beacons**

Our web pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that are used to help deliver cookies on our websites, count users who have visited those pages and deliver co-branded services. Sometimes we include web beacons in our promotional email messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon and to enable us to recognize you and understand your activity on our websites as a result of these actions.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns and to improve our communications and your online experience.

We sometimes work with other companies that advertise on Skype or other Microsoft websites to place web beacons on their websites or in their advertisements to let us develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement on a site results in a purchase or other action on the advertiser's website.  

Through Skype’s affiliate program qualified third-party websites (“affiliates”) can receive payment for referring users to Skype.com that complete certain actions, such as the purchase of Skype Credit. If you arrive on Skype.com from an affiliate website, the affiliate will set a cookie on your computer which is used to qualify them for compensation.  Should you then complete an action on Skype.com that could result in a payment to an affiliate, Skype will communicate to our affiliate program network partner through a tracking tag, or pixel that the event was successfully completed. The tracking tag (or pixel) will include information that identifies the affiliate website that referred you to Skype.com, which is available from the cookie set by the affiliate.

Cookies set by affiliates are not within Skype’s control and for more information please visit our affiliate program network partner Commission Junction’s site at: http://www.cj.com/privacy.

Finally, our websites may contain web beacons from third parties to help us compile aggregated statistics regarding the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other website operations. These web beacons may allow the third parties to set or read a cookie on your computer. These companies may collect information about your online activities across websites or online services, however, we prohibit third parties from using web beacons on our websites to collect or access information that directly identifies you (such as your name or email address). You may be able to opt out from data collection or use by these third-party analytics companies as described under Third-Party Analytics Controls.  
  

**Other Similar Technologies**

In addition to standard cookies and web beacons, our websites and software can use other technologies to store and read data files on your computer. This may be done to maintain your preferences or to improve speed and performance by storing certain files locally.  But, like standard cookies, these technologies can also be used to store a unique identifier for your computer, which can then be used to track online activity. These technologies include Local Shared Objects (or "Flash cookies"), HTML5 Local Storage and Silverlight Application Storage.

*   **Local Shared Objects or "Flash cookies."** Websites or software that use Adobe Flash technologies may use Local Shared Objects or "Flash cookies" to store data on your device. To manage or block Flash cookies when using Windows, go to the Control Panel and select Flash Player. For other operating systems, learn more at http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings\_manager.html.

*   **Silverlight Application Storage.** Websites or applications that use Microsoft Silverlight technology can store data on your device using Silverlight Application Storage. To learn how to manage or block such storage, visit Silverlight.  
      
    

**How to Control Cookies and Similar Technologies**

Microsoft provides browser controls to help you manage cookies.  You can also accept cookies but opt out of their use to behaviorally target advertisements.  For instance, Microsoft’s advertising preference and opt-out controls are available at http://choice.live.com/advertisementchoice/.  
  

**\- Browser Controls to Block Cookies.**

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but allow you to modify your browser setting to block cookies. For example, in Internet Explorer 11, you can block cookies by taking the following steps:

1.  Click "Tools" and then select "Internet Options"
2.  Click the "Privacy" tab at the top of the window
3.  Move the slider up or down to indicate the rules you want to apply for blocking cookies

Look to the privacy statement or other documentation to learn how to block cookies in other browsers.

Please be aware that if you choose to block cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use features of Skype websites, software and products that depend on cookies, and any advertising preferences that are dependent on cookies may be lost.  
  

**\- Browser Controls to Delete Cookies**.

If you accept cookies, you can delete them later. For example, in Internet Explorer 11, you can delete cookies by taking the following steps:

1.  Click "Tools" and then select "Internet Options"
2.  On the "General" tab, under "Browsing History," click the "Delete" button
3.  On the pop-up, select the box next to “Cookies”
4.  Click the "Delete" button

Look to the privacy statement or other documentation to learn how to delete cookies in other browsers.

Please be aware that if you choose to delete cookies, any settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, will be deleted and will need to be recreated.  
  

**\- Skype Software Controls to Block Skype Cookies**

In the Skype for Windows desktop software, Skype software browser cookies can be disabled by accessing the File menu from your Skype software toolbar, choosing the Privacy option and un-checking the ‘Accept Skype browser cookies’ box.  
  

**\- Browser Controls for “Do Not Track” and Tracking Protection.**

Some newer browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the websites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. Those websites (or the third-party content on those websites) may continue to engage in activities you might view as tracking even though you have expressed this preference, depending on the websites’ privacy practices. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, Microsoft does not currently respond to the browser DNT signals on its own websites or online services, or on third-party websites or online services where Microsoft provides advertisements, content or is otherwise able to collect information.  We continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of how to treat DNT signals. In the meantime, users may continue to opt out of targeted ads from Microsoft as set forth below.

Internet Explorer (versions 9 and up) have a feature called Tracking Protection that helps prevent the websites you go to from automatically sending details about your visit to third-party content providers. When you add a Tracking Protection List, Internet Explorer will block third-party content, including cookies, from any site that is listed as a site to be blocked. By limiting calls to these websites, Internet Explorer will limit the information these third-party websites can collect about you. For more information about Tracking Protection Lists and Do Not Track, please see the Internet Explorer Privacy Statement or Internet Explorer Help.  
  

**\- Advertising Opt-Out Controls.**

Because cookies can be used for many purposes, users who do not want to receive behaviorally targeted advertising can choose to accept cookies but opt out from that particular use. Companies in the online advertising industry have developed guidelines and programs to help protect users’ privacy, and these industry programs include web pages you can visit to opt out from receiving behaviorally targeted advertisements from all participating companies (including Microsoft). These pages include:

1.  In the US:
    *   US Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Consumer Choice Page
    *   Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) Opt-Out Page  
          
        
2.  In Europe:
    *   Visit Your Online Choices Page  
          
        
3.  In Canada:
    *   English: Ad Choices: Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (DAAC)
    *   French: Choix de Pub: l’Alliance de la publicité numérique du Canada (DAAC)  
          
        

Additionally, in some versions of the Skype software that offer targeted ads, you may opt-out of Microsoft targeted ads displayed in the software by visiting the privacy options in the software or account settings menu.  If you opt-out, you will still receive advertisements based on your country of residence, language preference, and IP address location, but other targeting information will not be used. 

In some instances, Microsoft Advertising may facilitate the placement of advertisements in Skype software by other online advertising networks.  In some cases, these third parties may also place cookies on your device and may collect information about your online activities across websites or online services. 

If you have opted-out of targeted ads in the Skype software as outlined above, Skype will not pass any of your profile information to such advertising providers with the ad request.  However, because third parties may place cookies on your computer that facilitate their own targeting, the Skype opt-out mechanism described above may not prevent ad targeting by these third parties.  These third parties may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting based on their cookies.  Learn more about these third parties and how to manage your preferences with them in the Microsoft Advertising Privacy Statement.    Many of them are also members of the Network Advertising Initiativeor the Digital Advertising Alliance, which each provide a simple way to opt out of ad targeting from participating companies.

**\- Third-Party Analytics Controls**

As described in more detail above, Skype and many websites and online services from other companies use third-party analytic services, which use cookies and web beacons to compile aggregated statistics regarding the effectiveness of promotional campaigns or other website operations.  You can opt out of data collection or use by some of these analytics providers by clicking the following links:

  

*   Omniture (Adobe): http://www.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/optout.html
*   Nielsen: http://www.nielsen-online.com/corp.jsp?section=leg\_prs&nav=1#Optoutchoices

**How we collect:  
  
**We use a number of methods and technologies to gather information about how you use our websites, software and products, such as:

*   Web forms, such as when you type information into a registration form or type a search query into a search box.
*   Technologies like cookies and web beacons; 
*   Web logging, which enables us to collect the standard information your browser sends to every website you visit - such as your IP address, browser type and language, and the site you came from - as well as the pages you visit and the links you click while using our websites and products.

Using Your InformationUsing Your Information Skype uses the information we collect to operate, improve and personalize Skype and other Microsoft software, products and features.  
   
We also use the information to communicate with you, for example, informing you about your account and security updates, or to organize and carry out marketing or promotional operations/offers, contests, games and similar events.  And we use the information to help make the ads we show you more relevant.   

Skype uses the information we collect to operate, improve and personalize Skype and other Microsoft software, products, and features. For example, information that you provide as part of your Skype profile may be included in the search directory to enable other users of Skype (or products that interact with Skype, such as Skype for Business) to search for you and connect with you.  Information collected through Skype may be combined with information collected through other Microsoft products and services to give you a more consistent and personalized experience in your interactions across Microsoft products and services.  We may also supplement this with information from other companies. For example, we use services from other companies to help us derive a general geographic area based on your IP address in order to customize certain features or offers to your geographic area.

We also may use the information to communicate with you, for example, informing you when a subscription is ending, letting you know when security updates are available, letting you know when you need to take action to keep your account active, or to organize and carry out marketing or promotional operations/offers, contests, games and similar events.

We provide many of our products, software and features free of charge because they are supported by advertising. The information we collect may be used to help improve the advertisements you see by making them more relevant to you.

We also use the information to resolve disputes and protect your interests, as well as Skype’s and Microsoft’s interests, including, in particular enforcing Skype’s Terms of Use and preventing and fighting against fraud.

Sharing Your InformationSharing Your Information We will share your personal information with third parties with your consent.  We may also share or disclose personal information with (1) Microsoft affiliates, partners and vendors. (2) when required by law or to respond to legal process. (3) to protect our customers, to protect lives and to maintain the security of our services. and (4) to protect the rights or property of Skype and Microsoft.

We will share your personal information with third parties with your consent.  For example, we share your content with third parties when you tell us to do so, such as when you send a message to a contact using Skype.

We may share or disclose personal information with other Microsoft controlled subsidiaries and affiliates. and, as necessary, with partners  (e.g. telecom carriers, Wi-Fi access services providers, distributors of Skype software and/or Skype products, third party banking organizations or other providers of payment services) and with vendors or agents working on our behalf.  For example, companies we've hired to provide customer service support or assist in protecting and securing our systems and products may need access to personal information in order to provide those functions.  In such cases, these companies must abide by our data privacy requirements and are not allowed to use the information for any other purpose.  We may also transfer your data to Microsoft Corporation, who may use it for purposes consistent with those described in this privacy statement. Moreover, we may disclose personal information as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of our assets.

We may access, disclose and preserve your personal information, including your private content (such as the content of your instant messages, stored video messages, voicemails or file transfers), when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to:

1.  comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process from competent authorities, including from law enforcement or other government agencies (or to assist our local partner, operator or company facilitating your communication to do the same).
2.  protect our customers, for example to prevent spam or attempts to defraud users of the services, or to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury to anyone.
3.  operate and maintain the security of our services, including to prevent or stop an attack on our computer systems or networks. or
4.  protect the rights or property of Skype and Microsoft, including enforcing the terms governing the use of products – however, if we receive information indicating that someone is using our products to traffic in stolen intellectual or physical property of Skype or Microsoft, we will not inspect a customer’s private content ourselves, but we may refer the matter to law enforcement.

Some Skype products may be (i) co-branded. (ii) made available via a partner company’s website. and/or (iii) supported through a partner company. If you register for or use such products, you consent to both Skype’s and the partner company’s use of personal data collected in connection with the product and you understand that the partner company’s use of your personal data may be subject to the partner company’s privacy policy. Skype may offer its software and products in connection with other websites or services or may team with other online services to give you the combined results of both products/software and services or additional services and benefits. To determine whether you would benefit from the combined offer, if you have provided your consent, Skype may match your email address, and email addresses of your contacts against email addresses you have provided to the third party website/service provider.

ChildrenChildren

Skype is not intended for or designed to attract users under the age of 13 and we do not intentionally or knowingly collect personal information on our websites from anyone under the age of 13 (or older in some jurisdictions).  We encourage parents to be involved in the online activities of their children to ensure that no information is collected from a child without parental permission.

AdvertisingAdvertising

Ads shown in the Skype software and advertising for Skype on third party websites are delivered by Microsoft Advertising or other carefully selected ad serving partners. When we display online advertisements to you, we will place one or more cookies in order to recognize your device when we display an ad to you. We may use non-personally identifiable information that you have provided to Skype, such as the age, gender, language and country of residence in your Skype profile as well as information about your relationship with and use of Skype’s websites, software, and products, such as the destination of your calls, in order to provide advertisements likely to be of greater interest to you and to help us measure and improve the performance of our advertising campaigns and offers. These ads may also be targeted based on other information Microsoft Advertising collects outside of Skype’s websites and software. For instance, Microsoft Advertising may utilize the same browser cookies set by Microsoft websites to enhance targeting within Skype software.  
  

Additionally, ads shown to you that are delivered by Microsoft Advertising on other web properties may be targeted based on non-personally identifiable Skype profile information (including profile information from linked Microsoft accounts), such as age, gender, country of residence, and language preference, as well as other information Microsoft Advertising collects outside of Skype’s websites and software.  Over time, we may gather information from the websites and software where we serve ads and use the information to help provide more relevant ads. You may opt-out of Microsoft targeted ads in your Skype software. The opt-out mechanisms vary depending on which Skype software you use.   Full details are provided below.

Skype websites and some Skype software may display third-party advertisements provided by Microsoft Advertising and its ad serving partners.  When we show online advertisements to you, we may place one or more cookies on your computer in order to recognize your device each time we display an ad to you. Because Microsoft Advertising serves advertisements on Microsoft websites as well as those of our advertising and publisher partners, we are able to compile information over time about the types of pages, content and ads you, or others who are using your computer, visited or viewed.  We use that information, along with non-personally identifiable information you have provided to Skype (including de-identified data from your   linked Microsoft account profiles), such as age, gender, country of residence, and language preference, as well as information about your relationship with and use of Skype’s websites, software, and products, such as the destination of your calls, in order to select the ads we show you and to help us measure and improve the performance of our advertising campaigns and offers.  For example, it helps us try to ensure that you do not see the same advertisements repeatedly. It also helps us select and display targeted advertisements that we believe may be of interest to you.  
  

If you sign-in to Skype using a Microsoft account or a Skype account that you have linked to a Microsoft account, you may opt-out of receiving targeted ads from Microsoft Advertising by visiting http://choice.live.com/advertisementchoice. Please note that opting out does not mean that you will stop getting ads or see fewer ads. however, if you do opt out, the ads that you receive will no longer be behaviorally targeted. In addition, opting out does not stop information from going to our servers, but it does stop our creation or updating of profiles that might be used for behavioral advertising.  
  

Because cookies can be used for many purposes, users who do not want to receive behaviorally targeted advertising can choose to accept cookies but opt out from that particular use.

You should also be aware that some browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” (DNT) features that, when turned on, send a signal in the browser header to websites and online services indicating that you do not wish to be tracked.  It is up to the website or online service you visit (and any third parties providing advertising, content, or other functionality on the website or online service) to decide how it will interpret and treat the signal.  However, there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal.  As a result, Microsoft does not currently respond to the browser DNT signals on its own websites or online services, or on third-party websites or online services where Microsoft provides advertisements, content or is otherwise able to collect information.  We continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of how to treat DNT signals. In the meantime, users may continue to opt-out of targeted ads from Microsoft as set forth above. CommunicationsCommunications

We may contact you with messages about your use of our websites, software and products.  We also may notify you of claims related to your use of our products, including without limitation, claims of violation of third party rights, via email, SMS, or the Skype software you are using.  We may also send you alerts by email or SMS to notify you when someone has tried to contact you.

We may also provide you with news and other promotional material related to Skype and/or other Microsoft products.  You can opt-out of the receipt of further news or promotional (a) emails by clicking the ‘unsubscribe’ link on the email that you receive or (b) SMS by following the instructions on the SMS that you receive.  You can also change your notification settings for both e-mail and SMS at any time on your account page on www.skype.com.

If you have a Microsoft account, depending on the respective service, you may also have the option of proactively making choices about the receipt of promotional email, telephone calls, and postal mail from other Microsoft websites or services by visiting and signing into  Microsoft's Promotional Communications Manager allows you to update contact information, manage Microsoft-wide contact preferences, opt out of subscriptions, and choose whether to share your contact information with Microsoft partners.

These choices do not apply to the display of online advertising: please refer to the section "Display of Advertising (Opt-out)" for more information. Nor do they apply to the receipt of mandatory service communications that are considered part of certain Microsoft services, which you may receive periodically unless you cancel the relevant services.

Location Based ServicesLocation Based Services Certain products or features can use information about your location to provide the feature you request or personalize your experience.  Location information may include data identifying nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi hotspots, as wells as Global Position System (GPS) data.

When you use a location-based service or feature, available cell tower data, Wi-Fi data and Global Position System (GPS) data may be sent to Skype and Microsoft.  Skype and Microsoft use location information to provide the services you request, personalize your experience and improve Microsoft and Skype products and services.  For example, Skype may contain features that are based on the Bing Maps service or other third party map services that allow you to share your current location on a map or to search for items on a map, such as nearby Wi-Fi access points. When you request to plot your location on a map or to search for nearby Wi-Fi access points, your request is provided to Bing Maps and/or the third party map service for processing.

When you use a Skype feature to plot your location using the Bing Maps service, Bing will collect those requests and location-related information related to the requests may be used for calculating payments to Bing’s data vendors as part of operating the service. For more information on how Bing collects and uses information, click here.  

To learn more about how third party mapping services collect and use information, see the privacy statements for those services.  Depending on the device you are using, Skype may use third party services to provide mapping services. For example, Skype may use Google maps on certain devices—you can learn more about the information that Google collects through its mapping services at http://www.google.com/privacy.html.

You have control of when location information is sent to Skype and Microsoft or made available to others.  Refer to the documentation that came with your device for information about how to turn off location features.

_Push Notifications_

When you use Skype on your device, Skype may use notification services available for that device to let you know of incoming calls, chats and other messages when you are not actively running or using the Skype application.  These services may be provided by a third party.  For example, messages sent to an Apple device may use Apple’s Push Notification Services.  Notification services may receive information about the caller, sender of the message and the content of the message as part of providing the service and may use the information in accordance with the terms and conditions and privacy policy for the third party service provider.  Skype is not responsible for the data collected by third party notification services.   
  

If you do not want to use third party notification services to receive notification of incoming Skype calls and messages, you can disable this in your notification settings in the Skype application settings or in the notification settings found in your device settings.
