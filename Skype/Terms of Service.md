**PLEASE READ CAREFULLY BEFORE DOWNLOADING THE SOFTWARE OR USING THE PRODUCT(S) OR SKYPE WEBSITES**

**Key Points**

It is important that you read the entirety of and understand this document. There are, however, a few key points that we need to emphasise:

**NO ACCESS TO EMERGENCY SERVICES:** The Software is not a replacement for your ordinary mobile or fixed line telephone. In particular, apart from in the very limited circumstances set out in paragraph 5.6 of these Terms (applicable to Skype’s Internet Communications Software only), the Software does not allow you to make emergency calls to emergency services. You must make alternative communications arrangements to ensure that you can make emergency calls if needed.

**CHECK RESTRICTIONS ON USE:** In some regions there are restrictions on the use of the Software. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are legally allowed to use the Software where you are located.

**NO OWNERSHIP OF NUMBERS:** If Skype allocates to you a Skype Number or Skype To Go Number, you do not own the number or have a right to retain that number forever. Skype may need to change or withdraw the number allocated to you from time to time. You will not transfer or attempt to transfer your Skype Number or Skype To Go Number to anyone else. You must ensure you comply with any allocation requirements displayed when purchasing a Skype Number as failure to do so could result in the number being withdrawn. Please see also paragraph 19.1.

**SKYPE CREDIT BECOMES INACTIVE AFTER 180 DAYS:** If you purchase Skype Credit please be aware that it becomes inactive after 180 days of inactivity. Please see also paragraph 9.2.

If you are using a version of the Software that is included with Windows 8.1 or later, the Software is licensed to you under the Microsoft Software License Terms for the version of Windows that you are running. These Terms (other than the software license in Section 4.1) will still apply to your use of the Software and Products.

If there is any inconsistency between those local terms and these Terms, then the local terms shall govern to the extent of that inconsistency.

**3\. CHANGES TO THE TERMS**

**4\. LICENCE**

**4.1 Licence.** Subject to your compliance with these Terms, you are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-assignable, free of charge license to download and install the Software on a personal computer, mobile phone or other device. and personally use the Software through your individual Skype user account, acting as an individual and not as a business entity (“**User Account**”). For the avoidance of doubt, (a) IT administrators working on behalf of a company may download and install the Skype Software onto personal computers or other devices used by personnel of such company. and (b) you are permitted to use the Software at a university or other educational institution, or at work. Skype reserves all rights not expressly granted to you under these Terms.

**4.2 Restrictions.** You may not and you agree not to:

(a) sub-license, sell, assign, rent, lease, export, import, distribute or transfer or otherwise grant rights to any third party in the Software;

(c) remove, obscure or alter any copyright notices or other proprietary notices included in the Software;

Additionally, our Software may contain features that allow you to submit information to, or plot yourself on a map using, a mapping service. By using those features, you agree to the terms that apply to those mapping services, which may include, as applicable, the Bing Maps End User Terms of Use available at http://www.microsoft.com/maps/assets/docs and the Google Maps available at http://www.google.com/intl/en\_ALL/help.  

**4.4 Third Party Notices.** The Software and Skype Websites may include third party code that Skype, not the third party, licenses to you under this agreement. Notices, if any, for the third party code are included for your information only. Third party scripts, linked to, called or referenced from the Software, are licensed to you by the third parties that own such code, not by Skype.

**5\. USE OF THE SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS AND SKYPE WEBSITES**

**5.1 Equipment:** In order to use the Software and the Products you will need an Internet broadband connection. You are responsible for providing all equipment required to access the Internet or enable communications such as headsets, microphones and webcams. Connecting to the Internet via a corporate or other private network which masks your location may cause charges to be different from those displayed for your actual location.  

**5.2 Use of Your Equipment:** The Internet Communications Software may use the processing capabilities, memory and bandwidth of the computer (or other applicable device) you are using, for the limited purpose of facilitating the communication and establishing the connection between Internet Communications Software users. If your use of the Internet Communications Software is dependent upon the use of a processor and bandwidth owned or controlled by a third party, you acknowledge and agree that your licence to use the Internet Communications Software is subject to you obtaining consent from the relevant third party for such use. You represent and warrant that by accepting these Terms, you have obtained such consent.

**5.3 Updates to the Software:** Skype may automatically check your version of the Skype Software. We may also automatically download configuration changes and updates to the Software from time to time. You may be required to update the Software in order to continue using Skype. You agree to accept such updates subject to these Terms unless other terms accompany the updates. If you do not agree, please discontinue use of and uninstall the Software. Skype is not obligated to make any updates available and does not guarantee that we will continue to support the version of the operating system or device for which you licensed the Software or that updated Software will be compatible for use with end users running older versions of the Software. Microsoft Corporation or its affiliates and subsidiaries may also automatically download updates to the Skype Software for Windows, if you have chosen to receive Microsoft Updates. Updates may be required to maintain software compatibility, provide security updates or bug fixes, or offer new features, functionality or versions.

**5.4 Suspension, technical improvement and maintenance:** From time to time, Skype may need to perform maintenance on or upgrade the Software, Products or Skype Websites or the underlying infrastructure that enables you to use the Software, Products or Skype Websites. This may require Skype to temporarily suspend or limit your use of some or all of the Software, Products or Skype Websites until such time as this maintenance and/or upgrade can be completed. To the extent possible and unless an intervention is urgently required, Skype will publish the time and date of such suspension or limitation on the Skype Website in advance. You will not be entitled to claim damages for such suspension or limitation of the use of any Software, Product or Skype Website.

**5.5 No Access to Emergency Services:** Neither the Products nor the Software are intended to support or carry emergency calls to any type of hospitals, law enforcement agencies, medical care unit or any other kind of services that connect a user to emergency services personnel or public safety answering points (“Emergency Services”). There are important differences between traditional telephone services and the Products. You acknowledge and agree that: (i) Skype is not required to offer access to Emergency Services under any applicable local and/or national rules, regulations or law. (ii) it is your responsibility to purchase, separately from the Products, traditional wireless (mobile) or fixed line telephone services that offer access to Emergency Services, and (iii) the Software and the Products are not a replacement for your primary telephone service. Find out more about calling 112, the dedicated emergency number for the EU at www.skype.com/go/emergency.

**5.6 Limited Emergency Calling (Internet Communications Software Only)**

**5.6.1** In a very limited number of countries, and for defined Internet Communications Software versions and platforms only, Skype will try to provide limited emergency calling as a stand-alone feature but can provide no commitment in this respect. See the full list of countries (“Enabled Countries”) and software versions and other platforms (“Enabled Versions”) that enable limited Skype emergency calling. Skype emergency calling is not available for any other countries, versions or platforms. You should keep traditional wireless (mobile) or fixed line telephone services available for your calls to Emergency Services and use Skype’s limited emergency calling only as an absolute last resort. In particular, please also note that:

(i) power cut, battery failure or internet connection failure can lead to a Skype call failure, including your call to Emergency Services. Additionally, any of the quality limitations set out in paragraph 5.9 below, may otherwise affect successful call connection.

(ii) where available, an emergency call made using the Internet Communications Software in an enabled country may not receive the same network priority as a call made using traditional wireless (mobile) or fixed line telephone services.

(iii) if your emergency call is connected, you will need to tell the Emergency Services operator that you speak to where you are physically located so that the correct emergency organisation can respond to your emergency and knows where to find you. If you do not provide this information when prompted, you acknowledge that your emergency call may not be completed and you will not be able to gain access to your required Emergency Services using the Internet Communications Software. Skype will have no liability for your failed emergency call in such circumstances.

(iv) other than for the Enabled Countries and Enabled Versions, Skype does not provide limited emergency calling in any country or for or in conjunction with any Products or using any platforms, devices, services or operating systems (including any products, platforms, devices, services or operating systems developed by third parties using Skype’s APIs, any of Skype’s software development kits or otherwise).

**5.6.2** In Enabled Countries, you should configure the limited emergency calling functionality by setting your default location for emergency calling in the Call Settings page of your desktop Internet Communications Software (if you are using a 4.1 version for Windows (or later) or version 2.8 for Mac OS X (or later)). It is your responsibility to ensure that this location information is correct and kept up-to-date if your physical address changes. Skype does not support emergency calls in the majority of countries around the world. Where limited emergency calling is supported Skype will not charge you to make an emergency call and you do not need to have a Skype Credit balance. If however your country is not supported for limited emergency calling then you should not attempt to, and agree not to, make any emergency calls using your Internet Communications Software. If, with your permission, another user uses your User Account, it is your responsibility to inform that user of the limited circumstances in which limited emergency calling is available.

**5.7 Content of Communications:** Skype is not the source of, does not verify or endorse and takes no responsibility for the content of communications made using the Software, including but not limited to any media that is shared through our communication features. By using the Software, you grant Skype an intellectual property license to use the content of communications to provide the Products, for example to transmit your communication to the intended recipient.

Skype reserves the right to review content submitted on or through the Software, Products and Skype Websites for the purpose of enforcing these Terms. Skype may, in its sole discretion, block or otherwise prevent delivery of any instant message, SMS, video, media, or other communication to or from the Software, Products and Skype Websites as part of our efforts to protect the Software, Products, Skype Websites or our customers, or to otherwise enforce these Terms. The following rules apply to your conduct and content when using the Software, Products and Skype Websites:

(a) Do not use the Software, Products or Skype Websites to do anything illegal. You are responsible for your actions and the consequences of your actions.

(b) Do not send spam or use your account to help others send spam. Spam is unsolicited bulk email, calls, instant messages, other communications and bulk contact requests.

(c) Do not upload, download or share inappropriate images (e.g. nudity, bestiality, pornography).

(d) Do not upload or share images or engage in any activity that exploits or harms children.

(e) Do not engage in activity that is false or misleading (e.g. attempting to ask for money under false pretenses or impersonating someone else).

(f) Do not engage in activity that is harmful to our Software, Products, Skype Websites or their users (e.g. viruses, stalking, engaging in hate speech, advocating violence against others).

(g) Do not infringe upon the legal rights of others (e.g. unauthorized sharing of copyrighted music, photographs and other content).

(h) Do not engage in activity that violates the privacy of others.

(i) Do not circumvent, disable or otherwise interfere with the security related features of the Software, Products or Skype Websites or features that prevent or restrict the use of any content.

We may ask you to remove your content if it violates these Terms or the law. Failure to comply may result in loss of access to, or cancellation of, your User Account. Additionally, Skype may remove your content without asking you if we determine it is in violation these Terms or the law or if we receive a notice of intellectual property infringement from a third party.

**5.8 Notice and Take-Down:** If Skype receives any notification that any material that you post, upload, edit, host, share and/or publish on the Skype Website or through the Software (excluding your private communications) (“**User Submission**”) is inappropriate, infringes any rights of any third party, or if Skype wishes to remove your User Submission for any reason whatsoever, Skype reserves the right to automatically remove such User Submission for any reason immediately or within such other timescales as may be decided from time to time by Skype in its sole discretion. The User Submission shall be taken down without any admission as to liability and without prejudice to any rights, remedies or defenses, all of which are expressly reserved. You acknowledge and agree that Skype is under no obligation to put back such User Submission at any time. If User Submissions infringe, or if you believe that User Submissions infringe any of your rights (including intellectual property rights) or are unlawful, please contact us immediately by following our notice and takedown procedure. Click here to view the Notice and Takedown Procedure. Skype reserves the right to ask for verification of your identity and to seek further information to verify your complaint. You agree that you are solely responsible for the consequences resulting from your complaint (including but not limited to removal or blocking of the User Submission) and you acknowledge and agree that any complaint may be used in court proceedings. Any false, misleading or inaccurate information provided by you may result in civil and criminal liability.

**5.9 Quality:** Skype cannot guarantee that the Software, Products or Skype Websites will always function without disruptions, delay or errors. A number of factors may impact the quality of your communications and use of the Software, Products (depending on the Products used) or Skype Websites, and may result in the failure of your communications including but not limited to: your local network, firewall, your internet service provider, the public internet, the public switched telephone network and your power supply. Skype takes no responsibility for any disruption, interruption or delay caused by any failure of or inadequacy in any of these items or any other items over which we have no control.

**5.10 Changes to Products:** Skype is constantly improving the Software and Products and may change them at any time. Additionally, there are reasons why Skype may stop providing the Software and Products (or portions thereof) including (without limitation) that it is no longer feasible for us to provide it, the technology advances, customer feedback indicates a change is needed, external issues arise that make it imprudent or impractical to continue, or any reason set out in paragraph 11.2. As a result of such changes, you may need to use an upgraded version of the Software. Technical requirements for use of Products and Software and feature descriptions are available on the Skype Website. If you do not agree with any changes to Software and Products you may terminate your relationship with Skype in accordance with paragraph 11. You may need to upgrade to a new version in order to enjoy the benefit of certain Products. In addition, you acknowledge and agree that certain Products may be subject to usage limits or geographical restrictions, which may vary from time to time. Please check the Skype Website for details of the most up-to-date usage restrictions that apply to the Products that you are using.

**5.11 Unsolicited Ideas** Skype does not consider or accept unsolicited proposals or ideas, including without limitation ideas for new products, technologies, promotions, product names, product feedback and product improvements (“Unsolicited Feedback”). If you send any Unsolicited Feedback to Skype through the Skype Website or otherwise, you acknowledge and agree that Skype shall not be under any obligation of confidentiality with respect to the Unsolicited Feedback.

**5.12 Reports** Certain parts of the Skype Websites or the Software may ask for written suggestions or problem reports such as using our contact form or problem report form (“**Reports**”). Please read carefully any specific terms, which govern those Reports. The Reports shall be deemed the property of Skype. Skype shall exclusively own all now known or hereafter existing rights to the Reports throughout the universe in perpetuity and shall be entitled to use the Reports for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without compensation to the provider of the Reports. Any Reports you send to Skype will not be treated as confidential and Skype shall not be liable for any disclosure of the Reports.

**5.13 Linking** You may link to the Skype Website from another website owned by you, provided you do so in a way that is fair and legal and does not damage our reputation or take advantage of it. You must not establish a link in such a way as to suggest any form of association, approval or endorsement by Skype where none exists. You may not frame the Site on any other site. Skype may revoke the permission to link to the Skype Websites at any time at its sole discretion and will notify you in this respect.

For example, if you send three SMS at the same time to a single destination at the rate of €0.056, you will be charged €0.17.

**8.3 Promotional Offers:** From time to time, Skype may offer Paid-For Products for free for a trial period. Skype reserves the right to charge you for such Products (at the normal rate) in the event that Skype determines (in its reasonable discretion) that you are abusing the terms of the offer, including if you are using any service, proxy or other devices or anonymous IP address that prevents us from locating you.

**8.4 Tax:** All prices for Paid For Products are inclusive of applicable taxes, including VAT, unless otherwise stated. You explicitly waive any right to VAT reimbursement from Skype if the amount of VAT ultimately payable by the latter to the tax authorities would for any reason be lower than the amount of VAT collected from you. The territories in the EU set out below are outside the scope of EU VAT under Council Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of VAT, as amended. The Skype Website does not enable users in such territories to take advantage of this VAT exemption and we therefore do not provide the Products in such territories: Mount Athos, Canary Islands, French Overseas Departments, Aland Islands, Channel Islands, Heligoland Island, Büsingen / Buesingen Territory, Ceuta, Melilla, Livigno, Campione d'Italia and Italian Waters of Lake Lugano.

**8.5 Third-Party Charges:** Using the Software on mobile applications will use some of the data allowance available on the data package to which you have subscribed with your mobile network operator. Out-of-country usage may lead to significantly higher costs than regular usage, and you are solely responsible for keeping yourself informed and paying for possible roaming and other applicable charges levied by your mobile network operator.

**9\. PAYMENT**

**9.1 Skype Credit.** You can pay for select Paid-For Products using Skype Credit. You can purchase Skype Credit using any payment method made available to you by Skype from time to time. The Skype Credit that you purchase will be credited to your User Account at the time of purchase (or if you are using a Skype Credit voucher, at the time you redeem that voucher).

**9.2 Inactive Skype Credit.** If you do not use your Skype Credit for a period of 180 days, (including Skype Credit that has been allocated to you by a Skype Manager administrator (unless you are a Managed Account user, please see Section 21) or another Skype user) Skype will place your Skype Credit on inactive status. You can reactivate the Skype Credit by following the reactivation link in My Account at https://secure.skype.com/account/credit-reactivate. Reactivated Skype Credit is not refundable. If you are located in Japan and you buy Skype Credit from the Skype Website, this paragraph does not apply to you and your Skype Credit shall expire 6 months from the date of purchase. You are not permitted to use any Skype Credit on or after the date of its expiry.

**9.3 Other payment methods.** Skype does not guarantee that you will be able to use your Skype Credit balance to purchase all Products. Where Skype Credit cannot be used to pay for a Product, Skype will make another payment method available to you. Skype reserves the right to remove or amend the available payment methods at its sole discretion.

**9.4 Recurring Payments.** Where you purchase Products on a subscription basis (monthly, every 3 months or annually (as applicable)), you acknowledge and agree that this is a recurring payment and payments shall be made to Skype by the method you have chosen at the recurring intervals chosen by you, until the subscription for that Product is terminated by you or by Skype.

**9.5 Auto-Recharge.**

(a) You can enable the Auto Recharge feature when you buy Skype Credit by ticking the appropriate box. If enabled, your Skype Credit balance will be recharged with the same amount and by the same payment method chosen when you first sign up for Auto-Recharge. For example, if you purchase 10 Euros of Skype Credit with your credit card, the recharge amount charged to your credit card will also be 10 Euros of Skype Credit. In future the same amount will be charged to your credit card every time your Skype account balance goes below the threshold set by Skype from time to time.

(b) If you purchased a subscription with a payment method other than credit card, PayPal or Moneybookers (Skrill), and you have enabled Auto-Recharge, your Skype Credit balance will be recharged with the amount necessary to purchase your next recurring subscription.

(c) You can disable Auto-Recharge at any time by accessing and changing your settings in your User Account.

**10\. REFUND POLICY**

**10.1** When you purchase Paid-For-Products directly from Skype you will be entitled to a cancellation period of fifteen (15) days (a **“Cooling-Off Period”**) unless you have made use of the Paid-For-Products in any way, in which case the Cooling-Off Period will be extinguished and your purchase cannot be cancelled or refunded.

**10.2** Outside of the Cooling-Off Period, only subscriptions are refundable unless used or expired.

**10.3** Expenditure of Skype Credit, allocation of a Skype Number, or use of any aspect of a subscription amounts to “use” of a Paid-For-Product. You hereby expressly agree that Skype Numbers may be allocated before the end of the Cooling-Off Period and become non-refundable upon allocation.

**19.3 Subscriptions**

(a) **Fair Usage Policy.** At Skype, we want all of our customers to get the best calling plans, known as ‘subscriptions’, at the lowest possible price. This Fair Usage Policy ("FUP") is designed to prevent fraud and abuse of our subscriptions by a small number of users.

Subject to this FUP, Skype’s unlimited subscriptions allow unlimited calls to landlines (and mobiles in certain countries) in the applicable subscription countries (excluding special, premium, service and non-geographic numbers). The countries included within your subscription are set at the time of original purchase and remain the same upon renewal. All calls will be disconnected and require a re-dial after a 2-hour duration.

Skype’s subscriptions are for individual use only (personal or business communications) in accordance with our Terms of Use and this FUP (“Legitimate Use”). The following is a non-exhaustive list of practices that would not be considered Legitimate Use:

(i) Using subscriptions for telemarketing or call centre operations;

(ii) Re-selling subscription minutes;

(iii) Sharing subscriptions between users whether via a PBX, call centre, computer or any other means;

(iv) Calling numbers (whether singly, sequentially or automatically) to generate income for yourself or others as a result of merely placing the call, other than for your individual business communications (and subject to paragraph 4.1 of the Terms of Use). and

(v) Unusual calling patterns inconsistent with normal, individual subscription use, for example, regular calls of short duration or calls to multiple numbers in a short period of time.

Other practices may be relevant in determining Legitimate Use and Skype reserves the right to take any unlawful, prohibited, abnormal or unusual activity into account in making its determination. Skype may at its option, terminate its relationship with you, or may suspend your subscription immediately if it determines you are using your subscription contrary to this FUP or Skype’s Terms of Use. Where reasonable, Skype will provide you with notice of improper usage before suspension or termination of your subscription and, if appropriate, Skype may offer you an alternative subscription.

(b) Skype reserves the right to withdraw or change the subscriptions at any time. If Skype changes the Products included in your subscription, Skype will notify you by email stating the changes and their effective date. If you do not wish to accept these changes, you are entitled to terminate your subscription, with effect from the date on which the changes are due to take effect.

(c) The “Unlimited World Extra” subscription has a minimum fixed term of 2 years from the date of purchase. You are not permitted to terminate it before the expiry of the 2-year minimum term except in case of breach by Skype of the Terms. This subscription is billed monthly as a recurring payment.

Channel Subscriptions may not be taken back to the Skype Manager and will no longer be available once the SIP profile has been deleted.

(c) Subject to Section 19.1, you may purchase and allocate Skype Numbers to a SIP Profile. The maximum number of Skype Numbers you can allocate to a SIP profile is 99. Skype Numbers allocated to a SIP Profile may be used as the CLI for that SIP Profile. No mobile or landline numbers can be allocated to a Managed Account as a CLI for a SIP Profile.

(d) Managed Accounts using Skype Connect may only be used with your PBX and may not be used on a personal computer, mobile or other device unless and until you cease using it with Skype Connect.

(e) Skype Connect should not be used as a standalone service but as a secondary communications channel only in connection with traditional telephone services. When using Skype Connect you shall configure your PBX and any other certified Skype Connect equipment so that all emergency calls are terminated through a standard landline connection or another telephone service that supports emergency calling.

**22.2 Channel Subscriptions**

(a) You must purchase a monthly Channel Subscription in order to set up a SIP Profile and use Skype Connect. You need to have a sufficient balance of Skype Credit in Your Skype Manager in order to purchase a Channel Subscription.

(b) A Channel Subscription is payable monthly using the Skype Credit in Your Skype Manager. This is a recurring payment and payments shall be made to Skype at monthly intervals using Skype Credit until the Channel Subscription is terminated by you or by Skype. If you do not have sufficient Skype Credit then you will not be able to purchase the Channel Subscription or use Skype Connect with that SIP Profile, until you deposit sufficient Skype Credit into your Skype Manager. You must purchase a separate Channel Subscription for each SIP Profile that you set up.

(c) The monthly fee payable for a Channel Subscription varies according to the number of concurrent calling channels that you wish to use with a SIP Profile. A SIP profile supports from 1 to 300 concurrent calling channels. A SIP Profile can have multiple concurrent calling channels and each channel allows one inbound or one outbound call at any time.

(d) In addition to the monthly fee payable for a Channel Subscription, Skype rates for calling phones are payable for all outgoing calls made using Skype Connect. Such rates shall be payable using the Skype Credit in Your SIP Profile. You need a sufficient balance of Skype Credit in Your SIP Profile in order to make and pay for calls to phones. The minimum duration of a billed Skype Connect call is 30 seconds. After the first 30 seconds, Skype Connect calls are billed at increments of 6 seconds thereafter. Fractions of less than 6 seconds will be rounded up. Skype Connect calls do not incur a connection fee.

(e) Other than the monthly fee for the Channel Subscription, no additional charges are payable for receiving incoming calls on Skype Connect.

(f) The fees payable for a Channel Subscription are set out at: http://www.skype.com/go/business.sip.pricing.

(g) You are not able to use Skype Connect unless you have purchased a Channel Subscription. If you do not purchase a Channel Subscription, any existing SIP Profile shall be disabled and you will not be able to make or receive calls using Skype Connect.

(h) You may change the number of concurrent calling channels included in your Channel Subscription at any time by cancelling the current number and setting up a new recurring payment for the new number of concurrent calling channels. Skype will refund the unexpired amount of the most recent monthly fee that you paid for your current Channel Subscription. The new recurring monthly payment shall begin on the date upon which you change the number of concurrent calling channels.
