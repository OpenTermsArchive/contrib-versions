' + '1.  Do the terms used in your Privacy Policy have any special meanings I need to know about?
    
    ' + '
    
    We recognize that many privacy policies are long, complicated and difficult to understand. That's why we've focused on using words and sentences that are easy to follow and mean just what they say. There are a few important definitions you should know about.
    
    ' + '
    
    As used in this Policy, the terms listed below have the following meanings:
    
    ' + '
    ' + '*   Customer
        
        ' + '
        
        A "Customer" is anyone who purchases AT&T products or services. When a Customer purchases retail products or services for use by others (for example, when a Customer purchases wireless service for use by family members), those individuals also may be considered Customers for purposes of this Policy.
        
    ' + '*   User
        
        ' + '
        
        A "User" is anyone who visits our websites.
        
    ' + '*   Personal Information
        
        ' + '
        
        "Personal Information" is information that directly identifies or reasonably can be used to identify an individual Customer or User. Examples include name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, Social Security number, and financial account number. Personal Information does not include Published Listing Information as discussed in more detail below.
        
    ' + '*   Anonymous Information
        
        ' + '
        
        "Anonymous Information" means information that does not directly identify and cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual Customer or User.
        
    ' + '*   Aggregate Information
        
        ' + '
        
        "Aggregate Information" means information about groups or categories of Customers or Users, which does not identify and cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual Customer or User. Aggregate Information is a kind of Anonymous Information.
        
    ' + '*   Website
        
        ' + '
        
        "Website" means any page or location on the Internet, no matter what device (cell phone, lap top, PC, etc.) or protocol (http, WAP, ftp or other) is used to access the page or location. In this Policy, we use the term website other similar terms such as "Internet site," "site" and "web page."
        
    ' + '
' + '

' + ' **QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SCOPE OF THIS POLICY** ' + '

' + '1.  What AT&T companies are subject to this Privacy Policy?
    
    ' + '
    
    All direct and indirect subsidiaries of AT&T Inc. that collect, use or have access to information about our Customers or Users are subject to this Privacy Policy.
    
' + '2.  What does this Policy cover?
    
    ' + '
    
    This Privacy Policy covers our practices regarding the information we collect about our Customers and Users. All use of AT&T products and services, and all visits to AT&T websites are subject to this Privacy Policy.
    
' + '3.  Does this Policy apply to my family members or other users under my account with AT&T?
    
    ' + '
    
    Yes. This Policy applies to all Customers and Users. The Customer who holds the account with AT&T is responsible for making sure all family members or other Users under the same account understand and agree to this Policy.
    
' + '4.  When is information not covered by this Policy?
    
    ' + '
    
    Information that you provide to non-AT&T companies is not covered by this Policy. For example:
    
    ' + '
    
    ' + '*   When you download applications or make an online purchase from a non-AT&T company while using AT&T's Internet or wireless services, the information collected by the non-AT&T company is not subject to this Policy.
        
    ' + '*   When you navigate to a non-AT&T company from AT&T websites or applications (by clicking on a link or an advertisement, for example), information collected by the non-AT&T company is governed by its privacy policy and not this Privacy Policy.
        
    ' + '*   If you use public forums — such as social networking services, Internet bulletin boards, chat rooms, or blogs on AT&T or non-AT&T websites — you should be aware that any Personal Information you disclose publicly can be read, collected, or used by others. Once you choose to reveal Personal Information on such a site, the information is publicly available, and AT&T cannot prevent distribution and use of that information by other parties.
        
    ' + '*   If you are a wireless Customer roaming on the network of a non-AT&T company, information about your location, usage and the numbers you dial will be subject to the privacy policy of the non-AT&T company, and not this Policy.
        
    ' + '
    
    ' + '
    
    AT&T may license its brand to certain non-AT&T companies ("Licensees") for their use in marketing and selling certain non-AT&T products and services. Licensees are subject to AT&T quality control criteria and review procedures, designed to ensure a high standard of product or service performance. For example, Advanced American Telephones is a Licensee that sells AT&T-branded telephone equipment. If you provide information to Advanced American Telephones when purchasing an AT&T-branded product, your information will be subject to the privacy policy of Advanced American Telephones, and not this Policy.
    
' + '5.  Can my information be subject to more than one privacy policy?
    
    ' + '
    
    Yes. For example:
    
    ' + '
    
    ' + '*   When AT&T jointly provides a service with a non-AT&T company, your Personal Information may be subject to both this Policy and the privacy policy of the non-AT&T company. For example, AT&T High Speed Internet services are provided to some Customers in conjunction with Yahoo! Inc. In this arrangement, Internet access is provided by AT&T, while the portal through which Customers access the Internet is provided by both AT&T and Yahoo!. Personal Information collected through your use of the co-branded Internet portal is subject to both this Policy and the Yahoo! Privacy Policy.
        
        ' + '
        
        Because Yahoo! may treat your information in ways which differ from this Privacy Policy, you should familiarize yourself with the Yahoo! Privacy Policy if you choose to access the Internet via the AT&T Powered by Yahoo! portal, or maintain an AT&T Powered by Yahoo! e-mail account.
        
    ' + '*   If you purchase AT&T products or services from a non-AT&T retailer (like BestBuy or Amazon.com, for example) any information you provide to that retailer may be subject to that company's privacy policy, AT&T's Privacy Policy, or both.
        
    ' + '
    
    ' + '
    
    We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any non-AT&T company with which you do business to determine what information will be collected and how it will be used or disclosed to others.
    
' + '6.  Do any other stand-alone AT&T Privacy Policies remain in effect?
    
    ' // + '
    
    Yes. The Joint '). if ( pid == '13692' ) { document.write('AT&T EchoStar Privacy Policy'). } else { document.write('AT&T EchoStar Privacy Policy'). } document.write(' for AT&T|DISH Network Customer Account Information remains in effect.
    
    ' + '
    
    Yes. The Joint AT&T EchoStar Privacy Policy for AT&T|DISH Network Customer Account Information remains in effect.
    
    ' + '
    
    While AT&T will make every effort to limit other stand-alone policies, it is possible that such policies may be required. For example, in selected areas outside the United States AT&T may adopt separate privacy policies as necessary to reflect the requirements of applicable local laws.
    
' + '7.  What about business customers?
    
    ' + '
    
    AT&T may enter into written product or service agreements with business customers that contain specific provisions related to the confidentiality, security or other handling of information. When provisions of a written product or service agreement differ from or conflict with the provisions of this Policy, the terms of the written agreement will apply. In all other instances, the terms of this Policy apply.

        ' + '
    ' + '
' + '2.  How do we collect information?
    
    ' + '
    
    We collect information in three primary ways:
    
    ' + '
    ' + '*   **You Give Us Information:** We collect information from you when you purchase a service from us or when you interact with us about a product or service we offer or provide. For example, you provide us with Contact Information, and Billing Information (such as credit information and Social Security number) when you order a service or establish an account with us.

    ' + '
' + '3.  How do we use the information we collect?
    
    ' + '
    
    We use information we collect in a variety of ways. For example, we may use some or all of the information we collect as appropriate for the following purposes:
    
    ' + '
    ' + '*   To initiate, provide and manage the services you purchase, and to respond to your questions or problems;
        
    ' + '*   To develop, market, sell, bill, and collect for our products and services;

' + '4.  How do we use your information for local directory and directory assistance services?
    
    ' + '

    ' + '
    ' + '*   **Published Listing Information**
        
        ' + '
        
        Listings of AT&T local telephone and AT&T U-verse Voice Customers are made available in our directories and through directory assistance. We publish and distribute directories in print, on the Internet, and on CDs and/or other electronic media — some complimentary and some for a fee. These directories include published Customer names, addresses and telephone numbers. We also make that information available through directory assistance operators and systems (such as directory assistance, speech recognition, reverse number lookup and automated directory assistance services) and through the Internet.
        
        ' + '
        
        Published listing information may be used, sorted, packaged, repackaged and made available again in different formats by anyone.
        
    ' + '*   **Non-Published Information**
        
        ' + 'We offer Customers the opportunity to request that their name, number, and address not be published in our local directories or made available through directory assistance services. There is a fee for this service.
    ' + '*   **Non-Listed Information**
        
        ' + 'We also give Customers the opportunity to request that their names, numbers and addresses be "non-listed" in AT&T directories, but still made publicly available through directory assistance services.

    ' + '*   **Sharing with Unaffiliated Entities**

        We are also required by law to provide wireline directory assistance information to unaffiliated telephone companies and directory assistance providers on an unrestricted basis. However, we do not provide non-published telephone numbers to these providers.
        
        ' + '
        
        We provide non-published telephone numbers, where permitted by law, to government entities and public safety providers for public health or safety reasons such as responding to 911 calls and notifying the public of wide-spread emergencies.
        
        ' + '
        
        We may also provide Published Listing Information to government agencies, municipalities, utilities and other such entities for address and telephone number verification purposes.
        
        ' + '
        
        We share AT&T U-verse Voice Customer names, addresses and telephone numbers with unaffiliated entities as outlined above.
        
    ' + '
' + '

' + ' **QUESTIONS ABOUT LOCATION INFORMATION**' + '

' + '1.  What is wireless location information?
    
    ' + '
    
    The approximate location of your wireless device can be determined using information generated by its communication with near-by cell towers, Wi-Fi receivers and/or with other technologies, including the satellites that compose the Global Positioning System (GPS). That information is often referred to as your wireless "location information."
    
' + '2.  Do you collect and use my wireless location information?
    
    ' + '
    
    Yes. AT&T monitors, collects and uses wireless location information to provide you with wireless voice and data services. We also use that information, together with other usage and performance information obtained from our network and your wireless device, to maintain and improve our network and the quality of your wireless experience. Our use and collection of this information is consistent with the description provided in the "Questions about the Information We Collect, How We Collect It and How We Use It" FAQs.
    
' + '3.  What other types of services use my wireless location information?
    
    ' + '
    
    You can use your wireless device to obtain a wide array of services based on the approximate location of the device. These data services (referred to as Location-Based Services or "LBS") are made available by AT&T and other companies via applications that may be pre-loaded on your wireless device, or that you may choose to download from websites or other application stores. These applications use various technologies (including Global Positioning Satellite or "GPS," Assisted GPS, cell ID and enhanced cell ID technologies) to estimate the physical location of a Customer's mobile device.
    
    ' + '
    
    Services that allow others to see the approximate location of your wireless device, such as AT&T Family Map and AT&T's fleet locator services for business customers, are examples of LBS, as are navigation services that provide you with directions in response to your request (such as AT&T Navigator), and local search services (such as YP.com and YPmobile.com).
    
    ' + '
    
    Location information also may be used to enhance your experience of our existing services. For example, when you dial 411 Directory Assistance for a business phone number, we may use your location information to return the number of the business location closest to you. Similarly, when you choose certain services on AT&T's MEdia Net portal (for example, "Find Nearest") or download certain applications from the AT&T AppCenter (for example, "Where"), the information provided may be tailored based on what's nearest to the location of your wireless device.

' + '1.  Do the AT&T companies share your Personal Information with each other?
    
    ' + '
    
    Yes. AT&T products and services are developed, managed, marketed and sold by a variety of different AT&T companies including — but not limited to:
    
    ' + '
    
    ' + '*   Wireless telephone and Internet services provided by AT&T Mobility;

The AT&T companies share your Personal Information with each other as necessary to ensure your experience is as seamless and consistent as possible, and that you have the full benefit of what AT&T has to offer.
    
    ' + '
    
    Of course, any sharing of your Personal Information among the AT&T companies is subject to applicable legal restrictions, such as those that exist for '). if (pid == '2506' || pid == '13692') { document.write('Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI)'). } else { document.write('Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI)'). } document.write('.
    
' + '2.  What Is CPNI?
    
    ' + '
    
    Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) is information that relates to the quantity, configuration, type, destination, location and amount of use of the telecommunications services you purchase from us, as well as the information contained in your bills for those services. We collect CPNI in the normal course of providing you with telecommunications services. Your telephone number, name and address are not CPNI.
    
    ' + '
    
    View more information about our use of CPNI, and how you can control that use.
    
' + '3.  Do we share your Personal Information with non-AT&T companies?
    
    ' + '
    
    We share your Personal Information only with non-AT&T companies that perform services on our behalf, and only as necessary for the provision of those services. We use non-AT&T companies to perform many of the services outlined in the FAQ "How do we use the information we collect?" For example, we may use external vendors to process and print your AT&T billing statement, or to market, sell and provide customer service for AT&T products and services. We share your information with such vendors solely for that purpose.
    
    ' + '
    
    We require non-AT&T companies acting on our behalf to protect any Personal Information they may receive in a manner consistent with this Policy, and do not allow them to use that information for any other purpose. Most importantly, we do not sell, give or "rent" your Personal Information to non-AT&T companies for the marketing of their own products and services without your consent.
    
' + '4.  Are there any other circumstances in which your Personal Information may be provided to non-AT&T entities?
    
    ' + '
    
    We may provide Personal Information to non-AT&T companies or other third parties (for example, to government agencies, credit bureaus and collection agencies) without your consent for certain purposes, such as:
    
    ' + '
    
    ' + '*   To comply with court orders, subpoenas, lawful discovery requests and other legal or regulatory requirements, and to enforce our legal rights or defend against legal claims;
        
    ' + '*   To obtain payment for products and services that appear on your AT&T billing statements, including the transfer or sale of delinquent accounts to third parties for collection;

    ' + '*   To notify or respond to a responsible governmental entity if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires or justifies disclosure without delay;
        
    ' + '*   To display name and telephone number on a Caller ID device' // + ' (Note that Caller ID Blocking will prevent display of the name and number except in certain instances, for example, your name and number will not be blocked when you dial certain business, 911, or 900 or toll-free numbers)' + ';
        
        *   Note: AT&T's Caller ID Blocking services will not always prevent display of the calling party's name and number. For example, your name and number will not be blocked when you dial 911, or when you dial pay-per-call (900) or toll-free numbers.
        *   Be aware: A variety of websites and vendors offer services that will allow a caller to make it look like they are calling from a different number. In this situation, the name or number that displays on the caller ID or similar equipment will not be the actual number of the calling party. This is often called "number spoofing."
    ' + '*   To notify the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children of information concerning child pornography of which we become aware through the provision of our services.
        
    *   Customers and Users should be aware that AT&T affiliates and non-AT&T companies that perform services on behalf of AT&T may be located outside the country where you access our services.

    ' + '
    ' + '*   In the case of a court order obtained by a non-governmental entity, AT&T is authorized to disclose personally identifiable information collected from AT&T U-verse TV subscribers as a result of the subscriber's use of AT&T's U-verse TV service only after providing prior notice to the subscriber.

        ' + '

' + ' **QUESTIONS ABOUT AGGREGATE AND ANONYMOUS INFORMATION**' + '

' + '1.  Where do you get anonymous and aggregate information?
    
    ' + '
    
    We collect some information about how people interact with AT&T on an anonymous basis. For example, the information we collect about your visits to our websites using cookies and other similar technologies does not include information that would identify you personally.
    
    ' + '
    
    We may anonymize the personal information we collect about you by removing or "hashing" any data fields (such as name, address and telephone number), that identify you or that can be used to identify you personally. We use industry best practices and state-of-the-art techniques to anonymize and aggregate data.
    
    ' + '
    
    We get aggregate information by combining anonymous data that meet a certain criteria into groups. For example, we might want to know the total number of customers in a particular city who currently subscribe to both AT&T U-verse TV and AT&T wireless services. The resulting number would be an aggregate total.
    
    ' + '
    
    We may employ non-AT&T companies to anonymize or aggregate information on our behalf. If we do, all of the requirements discussed in response to the FAQ, "Do we share your Personal Information with non-AT&T companies?" apply. The non-AT&T company is required to protect any personal information they may receive from AT&T, and is not allowed to use the information for any purpose other than as directed by AT&T.
    
' + '2.  How do you use aggregate and anonymous information?
    
    ' + '
    
    We use aggregate and anonymous information for a variety of purposes, as described in response to the FAQ "How do we use the information we collect?" For example, we might rely on aggregated statistics about wireless data use in a given area to help us plan network improvements, or to target or evaluate the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising for our U-verse services.
    
' + '3.  Do you share aggregate or anonymous information with non-AT&T companies?
    
    ' + '
    
    Yes. We may share Aggregate or Anonymous Information in various formats with trusted non-AT&T entities, and may work with those entities to do research and to provide products and services. For example:
    
    ' + '
    ' + '*   Retail, marketing and advertising companies that do not provide services directly for AT&T, but do offer products and services that may be of interest to you or to others;
        
    ' + '*   Media research companies that may use the data we provide in combination with other information to provide audience analysis services;
        
    ' + '*   Universities, laboratories, think tanks and other entities that conduct networking, social, behavioral, environmental and other types of scientific research, for the purpose of creating fundamental new knowledge;
        
    ' + '*   Government or other entities that may use this data for purposes such as municipal planning, transportation planning and navigation services, and emergency and disaster response coordination.
        
    ' + '
' + '4.  How do I know that these non-AT&T entities won't "re-identify" me based on the aggregate or anonymous information you share with them?
    
    ' + '
    
    Respect for individual privacy is fundamental to any decision we make about sharing information with non-AT&T entities. We provide that data only to non-AT&T entities that satisfy our security standards, and prohibit those entities from using that information for any purpose other than as agreed upon with AT&T. Re-identification is never one of those purposes.

' + ' **QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY FOR CHILDREN**' + '

AT&T websites are not designed to attract children under the age of 13, and availability of some products and services may be limited to adults (age 18 or as provided by law). Please refer to the applicable Terms of Service for specific age requirements.

' + '

We do not target children for the collection of information online and do not knowingly collect personally identifying information from anyone under the age of 13 unless we first obtain permission from that child's parent or legal guardian.

' + '

You should be aware that Internet and wireless devices and services purchased for family use may be used by minors without our knowledge. Any Personal Information collected as a result of such usage may appear to be associated with the adult Customer who subscribes to our services, and will be treated as such under this Policy.

' + '

We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children, and to participate in and monitor their online activity. We have developed an online website that provides comprehensive access to safety and control tools, expert resources, and tips designed to help customers and parents manage their technology choices and address any safety concerns about their children's use of AT&T products and services. Please visit AT&T Smart Controls for more information.

' + '

Customers of our AT&T Yahoo! Internet access service may establish a sub-account for a child under the age of 13, provided that the Customer is the parent or legal guardian of the child. The process we use for obtaining parental approval to collect information from a child under the age of 13 under these circumstances is described below:

' + '

' + '*   When someone under the age of 13 attempts to create an AT&T Internet Services account, we ask that he or she have a parent establish a Family Account in order to obtain parental consent.
' + '*   When any Family Account Customer creates a sub-account, including a sub-account for a child under the age of 13, we require name, e-mail address, birth date, gender, ZIP code, occupation, industry, and personal interests.
' + '*   AT&T uses the information collected on sub-accounts to create and maintain accounts, for research, to customize the advertising and content seen on our pages and for other marketing purposes. AT&T will not contact children under the age of 13 about special offers or for marketing purposes without parental consent.
' + '*   Parents are allowed to review, edit, update, and delete information relating to their child's sub-account, at any time, by logging into the sub-account and accessing the Account Information screen(s). In addition, children may be permitted to review, edit, update, and delete information relating to their sub-accounts.

' + '2.  How long do we keep your Personal Information?
    
    ' + '
    
    We keep your Personal Information only as long as needed for business, tax or legal purposes, after which we destroy it by making it unreadable or undecipherable.
    
    ' + '
3.  What safeguards does AT&T have in place?
    
    ' + '
    
    We have established electronic and administrative safeguards designed to secure the information we collect, to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of that information and to ensure it is used appropriately. Some examples of those safeguards include:
    
    ' + '
    ' + '*   All AT&T employees are subject to the AT&T Code of Business Conduct and certain state-mandated codes of conduct. The AT&T Code requires all employees to follow the laws, rules, regulations, court and/or commission orders that apply to our business — including, specifically, the legal requirements and company policies related to the privacy of communications and the security and privacy of Customer records. Employees who fail to meet the standards embodied in the Code of Business Conduct are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.
        
    ' + '*   We have implemented technology and security features and strict policy guidelines to safeguard the privacy of your Personal Information. For example:
        
        ' + '
        ' + '*   We maintain and protect the security of computer storage and network equipment, and our security procedures require user names and passwords to access sensitive data;
            
        ' + '*   We have implemented encryption or other appropriate security controls to protect Personal Information when stored or transmitted by AT&T;
            
        ' + '*   We limit access to Personal Information to those employees, contractors, and agents who need access to such information to operate, develop, or improve our services and products;
            
        ' + '*   We require caller/online authentication before providing Account Information so that only you or someone who knows your Account Information will be able to access or change the information.
            
        ' + '
    ' + '
' + '4.  Will you notify me in case of a security breach?
    
    ' + '
    
    Although we strive to keep your Personal Information secure, no security measures are absolute, and we cannot guarantee that your Personal Information will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this Policy (for example, as the result of unauthorized acts by third parties that violate the law or this Policy). We will make reasonable attempts to notify you if we determine that AT&T has experienced a security breach and there is a reasonably likely risk of identity theft, or where otherwise required by law.
    
' + '5.  Is AT&T A TRUSTe participant?
    
    ' + '
    
    Yes, AT&T is a Participant in the TRUSTe Privacy Seal Program. TRUSTe is an independent organization whose mission is to advance privacy and trust in the networked world.

' + ' **QUESTIONS ABOUT CUSTOMER CONTROL**' + '

' + '1.  Can I review and correct my Personal Information?
    
    ' + '
    
    Yes. AT&T honors requests from Customers to review their Personal Information maintained in reasonably retrievable form, and we are happy to correct information found to be inaccurate. Customers may verify that appropriate corrections have been made. Please contact us for assistance.
    
' + '2.  How can I limit your sales efforts?
    
    ' + '
    
    We have established policies and practices to meet the expectations of Customers and potential customers who have expressed a desire to limit certain types of solicitation communications from AT&T, including marketing contacts made via telephone, e-mail and text messaging.
    
    ' + '
    
    For example, we periodically send news and updates regarding AT&T services, products and special promotions to current and potential Customers via e-mail or text message. Every marketing e-mail we send contains instructions and an online link that will allow you to stop additional AT&T marketing e-mails for that product or service type. Customers may reply to wireless text message contacts with a "stop" message, and may also unsubscribe from AT&T marketing e-mails here.
    
    ' + '
    
    You can request to be removed from our telemarketing lists for consumer services and products by contacting us at one of the numbers listed here, or by sending an e-mail to privacypolicy@att.com. You also can request to be removed from these telemarketing lists when you receive an AT&T marketing or promotional call. Where required by state laws and/or regulations, we honor requests from businesses to be removed from our telemarketing lists.
    
    ' + '
    
    The FTC maintains a National Do Not Call Registry at https://www.donotcall.gov/, and your state may maintain its own Do Not Call Registry. Putting your number on these Registries also may limit our telemarketing calls to that number.
    
    ' + '
    
    View information about your ability to restrict our use of your CPNI for certain marketing purposes.
    
    ' + '
    
    Our practices as described above are designed to satisfy state and federal legal requirements limiting marketing contacts. You should know that those laws and regulations — such as the requirements governing the state and federal "Do Not Call" lists — generally permit companies to contact their own current and, in some cases, former customers, even when those customers are listed on the federal and state "Do Not Call" lists. Similarly, restricting our use of your CPNI will not eliminate all types of AT&T marketing contacts.
    
    ' + '
    
    To limit postal mail solicitations, contact us at the number listed here. With this limitation you will continue to receive billing statements, legal notices, product updates and other similar correspondence, and you may still receive some promotional mailings.
    
' + '3.  What can I do to limit junk e-mails and unwanted text messages?
    
    ' + '
    
    AT&T works hard to detect and prevent junk e-mails (also referred to as "spam" e-mails) from ever reaching your computer. However, if you are receiving unwanted spam at an AT&T e-mail address, please contact us for assistance at the appropriate link below:
    
    ' + '
    
    ' + '*   Customers served via the AT&T Powered by Yahoo! portal at www.att.net, please visit the AT&T Yahoo! Anti-Spam Resource Center;
        
    ' + '*   Customers served via the AT&T portal at my.att.net, please visit the AT&T Postmaster Website.
        
    ' // + '*   Customers served via the AT&T portal at www.yellowpages.com, please e-mail us at spam@attinteractive.com.
        
    ' + '
    
    ' + '
    
    To report unwanted text (SMS) and picture text (MMS) messages, you may simply forward them to short code 7726 (spells "spam" on some mobile device keypads). Messages forwarded to this short code are free, and do not count against your data usage or voice package. Some examples of unwanted messages include fraudulent schemes such as bank phishing or credit hoaxes.
    
' + '4.  What can I do to protect my passwords and Account Information?
    
    ' + '
    
    When selecting User names and passwords for AT&T accounts, you should choose words or characters that are not obvious. Likewise, you should always keep Personal Information such as account numbers, Usernames, passwords or similar information in a secure place and not share the information with others.
    
' + '5.  What should I do to protect my wireless devices?
    
    ' + '
    
    Most wireless devices store calling information on both the device and the SIM card and, in certain cases, on removable flash memory cards. You should use passwords to prevent unauthorized access to your wireless device, your wireless service account, and your voice mail. Also, you should delete all contacts, photos, and any other personal or sensitive information from your wireless device before you discard, trade or give it way. To delete this information you should:

Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) is information that AT&T telecommunications carriers obtain when providing your telecommunications services to you. CPNI includes the types of telecommunications services you currently purchase, how you use them, and the billing information related to those services, including items such as the types of local, long distance and wireless telecommunications services that you have purchased and your calling details. Your telephone number, name and address are not considered CPNI.

' + 'Use and Disclosure of CPNI' + '

We use your CPNI to offer you additional services of the type you already purchase from AT&T. We also may use your CPNI to offer you products and services, packages, discounts and promotions from the AT&T companies, such as High Speed DSL Internet access, wireless service and U-verse TV services, which may be different from the types of services you already purchase.

AT&T uses technology and security features and strict policy guidelines to safeguard the privacy of CPNI and protect it from unauthorized access or improper use. AT&T does not disclose CPNI outside of the AT&T companies or their agents without customer consent except as required or allowed by law. When AT&T uses third parties to perform services on its behalf that require the use of CPNI, AT&T requires that they protect CPNI consistent with this privacy policy. _AT&T does not sell CPNI to unaffiliated third parties._

**Q.** What is your policy on limiting AT&T marketing materials sent by U.S. mail?  
' +'

**A.** Customers can unsubscribe from AT&T marketing materials sent by U.S. mail here.

' +'

**Q.** What changes are you making to your password policy for voicemail?  
' +'

**A.** Today, customers have the option and are strongly encouraged to password-protect access to their wireless voicemail. Beginning August 5, voicemail accounts for new customers, those who change phone numbers, upgrade to Visual Voice Mail, or create a new voicemail box will default to a password required setting to check voicemail from their wireless or any other device.

' +'

Although AT&T strongly recommends using a password, customers want a choice. Customers may opt out of using a password, but only after the initial password is established and they affirmatively turn off the password feature from the main menu.

' +'

New and existing AT&T customers may visit www.att.com/vm for easy step-by-step instructions for setting and turning on a password. Here, you can also learn how to reset your current password.

' + '

**Q.** What additional updates have you made to the AT&T Privacy Policy during the feedback period?  
' + '**A:** We’ve added information about limiting unwanted text messages by forwarding them to short code 7726 (spells “spam” on some mobile device keypads).

We also provided some additional clarification on when we may share your personal information with non-AT&T companies for billing purposes.

' // + '

' // + '

**Q:** When does the updated AT&T privacy policy go into effect?  
' // + '**A:** The preview launched November 17, 2010. Customers will have at least 45 days to review and/or provide feedback. The policy will go into effect after the final policy posting. We anticipate the new policy will go into effect in January 2011.

' // + '
