1\. Changes to this Agreement and/or the Service

We may change any terms, conditions, rates, fees, expenses, or charges regarding your Service at any time. We also reserve the right to modify or discontinue the Service, temporarily or permanently. We will provide you with notice of material changes via either your Member Account e-mail address or any other email address you provide, posting online at https://www.att.com/internet-terms, recorded announcement, bill message, bill insert, newspaper ad, postcard, letter, or call to your billed telephone number or U.S. mail. It is your responsibility to check for any such notices. Your continued subscription to the Service after the effective date of the change constitutes your acceptance of such changes.

2\. Internet Service a. _Service Description._

Internet Service is composed of narrowband or broadband access to Internet, and offers you a capability for acquiring or retrieving information from. generating, storing, transforming, processing, or utilizing information on. or making available information to other Internet end points connected directly or indirectly to AT&T's network. Unless otherwise specified, Internet Services from AT&T include the following:

1) _Site Access / E-Mail Services_.

Access to att.net and related services, including an e-mail account for the Member Account holder and any Sub Accounts, is generally included with your Internet Service. Such access will be subject to the att.net Terms of Use found at https://www.att.com/legal/terms.attNetTermsOfUse.html. By utilizing such access, including accessing the included e-mail account(s), you are agreeing to be bound by the terms thereof.

2) _DNS Services / DNS Language Assist_.

Domain Name System (or DNS) services translate domain names into the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices within the underlying network protocols commonly used to organize the internet. The DNS Services include DNS Language Assist, which upon entry of an incomplete or inaccurate Web address will automatically search for similar or related terms and present you with suggested sites you may want to reach instead of providing only an error message. If you prefer to opt out of DNS Language Assist, you may do so by visiting att.com/cmpchoice from your desktop or from your mobile Web browser.

3) _IP Addresses_.

Unless otherwise specified, AT&T Internet Service is provided with a dynamic Internet Protocol ("IP") address, a static IP address, a multiple static IP address service (as applicable), or a privately managed IP address utilizing CGN (Carrier Gateway NAT) technology, at the sole discretion of AT&T. Static IP addresses are not available with all Internet Services or all tiers within certain Internet Services. Unless otherwise specified, a dynamic IP address is a single Internet address intended for use with a single Member Account and any associated Sub Accounts and a static IP address or multiple static IP address is intended for use with a single computer or a network of devices, computers and/or servers. You may not use the Service in a manner that is inconsistent with these intended uses. Unless otherwise specified, AT&T Internet services will support both IPV6 and IPV4 Internet addresses. however, to reach IPv6-exclusive Internet content, some of your equipment may require upgrades or replacement. For more information about IPv6 and how it affects you, visit att.com/ipv6.

4) _Interconnection_.

Because the Internet consists of multiple interconnected networks and most Internet end points (e.g., websites and other content providers) are not directly connected to AT&T's network, AT&T must connect to and exchange traffic with other networks to provide its subscribers the capability of uploading data to or downloading data from Internet end points that are connected to those networks. To that end, AT&T has entered into commercially negotiated agreements to exchange traffic with such networks on mutually agreeable terms. Consistent with its longstanding practice, AT&T does not warrant that it will establish or expand the connections between its network and other networks except on such mutually agreeable terms. To the extent AT&T is unable to reach agreement on terms of interconnection or network expansion with these other networks it could affect your service These impacts on your service performance are described in more detail in AT&T's Open Internet notice. AT&T therefore makes no promise express or implied that you will be able to upload data to or download data from Internet end points connected to other networks at any particular speed.

Like the other networks that make up the Internet, AT&T's is a shared network, which means that the transmission links and other network resources used to provide the Service are shared among AT&T's subscribers. AT&T manages this network for the benefit of all users based on a variety of factors, and our technical expertise.

b. _"Speed" of Internet Services, Technology and Data Usage._

AT&T offers many broadband internet access service options, each of which has a specific service capability speed range. The term "speed" is commonly used as a shorthand way to describe the capacity at which a particular broadband internet access service can transmit data. This capacity is typically measured in the number of kilobits, megabits or gigabits that can be transmitted in one second (Kbps, Mbps or Gbps). Some applications like a short email without attachments or basic web browsing do not require high service capability speeds to function optimally, while other activities like transferring large data files can be performed faster with higher-speed services. Your service capability speed may not be suitable for some applications, particularly those involving real-time or near real-time, high-bandwidth uses such as streaming video or video conferencing.

1) _AT&T Speed Tiers Page._

The current speed ranges AT&T offers may be found on AT&T's Speed Tier page at att.net/speedtiers, which identifies the downstream and upstream rates at which your "Connection" (as that term is defined below) transfers internet access data between the network interface device at your home, office, or apartment building to the point you connect to the AT&T network. Our wired broadband Internet access customers should expect to see service capability speeds for their Connection within the speed tier shown on the Speed Tier page or their service plan. For example, a customer with AT&T Internet 25 Service should expect service capability download speeds between 15 Mbps and 25 Mbps between the network interface device at your premises and the point at which you connect to the AT&T network. The high-end of this range represents expected maximum speed capabilities.

2) _"Connection."_

Because service performance varies on an end-to-end basis, the service capability speeds of AT&T are limited to, and measured between, the equipment utilized to provision your Internet Service at the fixed address or location you identified when ordering the Internet Service and a point on the AT&T network, sometimes referred to as the "Connection" or your "internet connection." The Connection constitutes only one segment of the end-to-end transmission path connecting the end user to Internet Web sites or content providers.

3) _Technology_.

Unless otherwise expressly agreed to the contrary, AT&T makes no warranty with regard to the technology used to provision any particular Internet Service. Notwithstanding any description that may be furnished for a particular Internet Service, AT&T reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to make changes to the technology used to provision all or any portion of any Internet Service. So long as the essential functionality of the Internet Service from a user perspective is not negatively impacted in a material way by any change in technology, AT&T has no obligation to notify you of any changes in technology and changes in technology will not affect your rights or obligations with respect to the Internet Service you have purchased.

For any particular Internet Service, the technology utilized to provision different portions of the Service may vary significantly. In those circumstance, and unless otherwise expressly agreed to the contrary, AT&T shall only be responsible for the technology utilized to provision the Connection. By way of example, for an Internet Service which AT&T provisions across its 100% fiber network, AT&T can only determine that the Connection itself is provisioned using 100% fiber based facilities. As discussed in further detail below, AT&T has no control over, and makes no warranties with respect to, the technology within the premises to which the Internet Service is provisioned (e.g. the inside wiring, home network and/or local access network). AT&T further has no control over and makes no warranties with respect to the technology utilized by content providers for purposes of operating the servers which an end user must access in order to receive access to the content.

4) _Other Factors that Impact Speed._

In addition to issues presented by the various technologies over which an internet access may operate on an end-to end basis, end-to-end performance of your Internet Service will also depend on a variety of other factors, including (but not limited to): the number of subscribers simultaneously using the network. specific characteristics of the location from which you are accessing the internet. specific characteristics of your intended destination on the internet. overall traffic on the Internet. Wi-Fi connectivity. interference with high frequency spectrum on your telephone line. wiring inside your premises, office or apartment complex. the capacity or performance of your network devices, routers, gateways or modems. the servers with which you must communicate with in order to reach your intended destination and/or access the content you are trying to access. internal and external network management factors (including Overhead, which refers to the various control and signaling data required to achieve the reliable transmission of Internet access data). and, the networks you and others are using when communicating. In addition, your use of other AT&T services (such as U-verse TV, AT&T Phone, Unified Messaging, and other services) that may share the capacity of your broadband connection with the Service may impact the amount of capacity available for your use of the Service at that particular time and thus affect the performance of the Service. Consequently, AT&T does not guarantee the performance of your service on an end- to-end basis. This is also why third party speed tests which include other portions of the overall internet connection beyond the Connection itself may yield results which are outside the specified speed range for your particular service plan on the Speed Tier page. AT&T expressly disclaims any warranty with respect to the outcome of these third party speed tests.

5) _Download vs Upload Speeds._

The term "download" generally refers to the process of a user utilizing their local device or computer to access information stored on a remote device, computer or server connected to the internet and includes activities ranging from "surfing" the internet, to downloading a file to streaming video. The term "upload" generally refers to the process of a user sending information from their device or computer to a remote device, computer or server connected to the internet. Unless otherwise specified, references to the "speed" of an Internet Service will solely be with respect to the download speed of that Service. Similarly, unless otherwise specified, AT&T makes no guarantee that the upload speed of a particular Internet Service will be the same as the download speed, either in terms of the applicable speed range or in terms of actual performance at any given moment. In fact, as set forth on the Speed Tier Page, many Internet Services have upload speed ranges which are lower than the comparable download speed ranges. As a result, and as a result of the many other factors that might affect speed at any given moment, the actual upload and download speed of any Internet Service will vary greatly from time to time and day to day.

6) _Data Usage on Residential Internet Services._

The residential Internet Service you purchased includes either an unlimited data allowance or a monthly data usage allowance with overage charges for usage in excess of your allowance. More details regarding the applicable data allowance, is set forth in the Customer Service Summary or Order Confirmation Letter you received. Use of certain services, including but not limited to digital TV features and apps, AT&T Digital Life, home security, home automation and medical alarm systems, whether provided by AT&T or a third party, may count towards your Internet data usage allowance. For additional information about the use of your residential AT&T Internet Service, including management of your data usage, as well as information about other data plans that you might consider, please refer to https://www.att.com/internet-usage. (This paragraph is not applicable to Business Internet Services.)

c. Availability and Service Changes. 1) _Availability._

AT&T Internet Services are not available in all areas, and may not be available at certain speed tiers (or at all) at your location, even if our initial testing, an AT&T website and/or any sales representative or other personnel associated with AT&T indicated that your location qualified for a particular speed tier or Service. If your location is situated in an MTU, availability of any particular Internet Service may depend upon the owner and/or manager of the MTU agreeing to grant AT&T access to the MTU and/or to your particular location.

The availability of any Internet Service may also be subject to various limitations upon the capacity of the various technologies utilized in AT&T's network to support a given number of customers on any particular Internet Service and/or speed tier in a given area ("Capacity Limitations"). Some Internet Services are more likely to be subject to Capacity Limitations. When a particular part of AT&T's network is approaching a Capacity Limitation, it can be very difficult for AT&T to predict exactly when or how that Capacity Limitation will impact upon the availability of a particular Internet Service to a particular location. This may mean that, although a certain location may be theoretically capable of receiving the Internet Service in question, Capacity Limitations at the time a particular order is placed may mean that a particular Service is not available to a particular location. This can even occur between the time that a Service is ordered and the time that the Services is installed / fulfilled, resulting in a Service that was shown as being available to a particular location at the time an order was placed no longer being available at the time of installation. As discussed in Section 5 below, Capacity Limitations may also mean that if a Service is terminated at any location for any reason whatsoever, it may not be possible to restore or renew that Service at that location. For all those reasons, AT&T makes absolutely no guarantee as to the availability of any Internet Service at any location.

2) _Service Changes._

AT&T reserves the right to modify or discontinue any Internet Service (including rates and charges), temporarily or permanently. If AT&T makes a change that would have a material impact on your Service, AT&T will endeavor to provide you with reasonable notice of any such change. The terms and conditions for temporary changes, if any, will be included in the notice and incorporated by reference into this Agreement at: att.com/temporaryterms. Your continued subscription to the Service after the effective date of the change constitutes your acceptance of the changes and the associated terms and conditions. In lieu of notice and Web site posting, AT&T may instead, at its sole discretion, require customers to enter into an agreement with AT&T regarding temporary material changes.

3) _Technology Conversions._

In the event that AT&T determines to provision Internet Service at your location utilizing a different technology, we will evaluate whether the conversion can occur without significant interruption to your service, generally defined as no noticeable interruptions during normal business hours and no single interruption outside of normal business hours of more than one (1) hour in length. If we determine that the conversion can be accomplished without significant interruption in your service, we may elect to proceed with the conversion without prior notice to you. If we determine that the conversion is likely to result in a significant interruption in your service, we will endeavor to provide you with at least thirty (30) days' notice of any anticipated significant interruptions of your service via email, direct mail, bill page message, and/or bill insert. If, due to factors outside our control, we cannot provide you with thirty (30) days' notice, we will endeavor to provide you with as much advanced notice as circumstances reasonably allow. Following the period identified in such notice, we may at our sole discretion, either disconnect your service or temporarily suspend your service for up to fifteen (15) days to facilitate the conversion process.

As part of any conversion, we may, in our discretion, discontinue the particular Internet Service you are currently receiving and make available to you an alternate Internet Service of comparable or better Speed at the then applicable rates, terms, and conditions, which may differ from your previous Internet Service rates, terms, and conditions (including Bundle Discounts). If you are on a Term Plan and your overall price will increase as a result of this conversion, taking into account all applicable credits and discounts, you will not have to pay any applicable Early Termination Fee if you elect to cancel your Internet Service within the period specified for doing so on your updated Customer Service Summary or Confirmation Letter.

Your new Internet Service may require different or additional equipment in order to fully utilize. If that proves to be the case, we will endeavor to either provide you with the required equipment or notify you of any equipment you will be required to provide on your own. You may also be required to review and accept new or additional terms and conditions related to the new Internet Service and/or new equipment. If that proves to be the case, your acceptance of such terms and conditions will be a condition to your ability to access and utilize the new Internet Service.

**d. Home Networking / Home Wi-Fi.** (These provisions apply to consumers. Business customers should refer to Schedule 6 for provisions applicable to Business Services.)

1) _Inside Wiring._

When ordering AT&T Internet Service, you will be responsible for providing any Inside Wiring (IW) in the form of copper wire or fiber optic cable between the AT&T network termination interface at your location and the gateway equipment that will located at your premises. In most cases, the IW will already be present in your existing locations, however you will be responsible for providing any additional IW which may be required. If additional IW is required, you may have the option of ordering IW from AT&T or installing your own IW. If you elect to install your own IW, the IW must be installed and available for use by AT&T Technicians before you order AT&T Internet Service. If IW service is ordered from AT&T, it is your sole responsibility to obtain landlord permission or approvals for such IW.

2) _Disclaimer of Warranties._

The condition of the IW over which your Internet Service is transmitted within your premises will impact the performance of the Internet Service, including with respect to speed, reliability and latency. You are solely responsible for the condition of any IW and AT&T expressly disclaims any responsibility thereto. If IW is provided by AT&T, upon completion of installation you will have full ownership and responsibility for such IW. **Unless expressly agreed in writing to the contrary, AT&T makes no warranty to you or any other party for any work or materials constituting or associated with any inside wire. AT&T expressly disclaims any warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular use, and AT&T has no responsibility to maintain, update, repair, replace, de-install, or remove any installed inside wire.**

3) Home Wi-Fi.

Depending upon the Internet Service you purchase, your Internet Service may include Wi-Fi enabled home networking equipment ("Wi-Fi Equipment") in order to help you allow Wi-Fi enabled devices to wirelessly connect to your Internet Service ("Home Wi-Fi"). (See the Applicable Schedule for details about what kind of Wi-Fi networking equipment many be included with the particular Internet Service you are purchasing.)

In order to use Home Wi-Fi, you must have Wi-Fi enabled devices that (a) meet U.S. and WiFi Alliance standards. (b) are compatible with the Wi-Fi network being generated by the applicable Wi-Fi Equipment. and (c) are capable of running IP and related protocols. The Wi-Fi enabled device you are utilizing must be in close enough proximity to the Wi-Fi Equipment to achieve connectivity with the Home Wi-Fi. Actual Home Wi-Fi coverage and quality may vary depending upon the location of the Wi-Fi Equipment, the location of the applicable Wi-Fi enabled device and conditions in and around the premises in which both the Equipment and the Wi-Fi enabled device operate.

Home Wi-Fi is designed to provide you with the highest speed available from your home network at any given point in time, subject to the many different factors that can affect network performance. AT&T's most recent generation of Wi-Fi Equipment generally supports the IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac standard, although older Home Wi-Fi Equipment may only support the IEEE 802.11b or IEEE 80.11b/g standards. The theoretical maximum speed you may be capable of achieving from your Home Wi-Fi will depend heavily on which IEEE 802.11 standard is supported by the Wi-Fi Equipment you have as well as which IEEE 802.11 standard is supported by the particular device you are utilizing. (By way of example only, IEEE 802.11b offers a theoretical maximum of 11 Mbps while IEEE 802.11n offers a theoretical maximum of 600 Mbps. Even if the Wi-Fi Equipment at your location is capable of supporting IEEE 802.11n, if you are utilizing an older device that is only capable of supporting the older IEEE 802.11b standard your theoretical maximum speed will be limited to 11 Mbps.)

Although the IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac standards have theoretical maximum speeds ranging from over ten Mbps to over a gigabit per second, depending on which standard applies, actual Wi-Fi speeds will be substantially lower than the theoretical maximum speeds which describe the physical throughput rate including Wi-Fi protocol communications. The result is that the maximum you can receive may not exceed 40%-50% of the theoretical maximum Wi-Fi standard speed and may be significantly lower depending on other applicable factors. In addition to the factors discussed above, the actual speed you experience over Wi-Fi will depend in part on the speed of the connection between the Wi-Fi network you are accessing and the destination you want to reach on the Internet, which may be significantly below the theoretical maximum speed of the service. (By way of example only, if you order AT&T Internet 25, with a download speed range of between 15 Mbps and 25 Mbps according to the AT&T Speed Tier page, even if the Wi-Fi Equipment at your location and the device you are utilizing are both capable of supporting the IEEE 802.11n standard with a theoretical maximum speed of 600 Mbps, the theoretical maximum internet download speed with your device connected to your Home Wi-Fi will never exceed 25 Mbps.)

4) Home Network Management.

Although AT&T reserves the right to manage any equipment used to access any Internet Service, you are solely responsible for all security measures over your in-home network, including any IW, local area network(s) and/or Wi-Fi Equipment. That includes, but is not limited to, access to authorization codes or passwords, as well as any encryption you deem necessary or required. AT&T may provide you with tools or software to assist you in managing one or more aspects of your home network (which software would then be included in the term "Software" as used herein below), but you remain solely responsible for all aspects of your home network, including any activity by children or other guests that you may allow (either intentionally or unintentionally, through lack of adequate security measures) to access your Internet Services via your home network and/or Home Wi-Fi. For that reason, AT&T recommends that you take all necessary measures to ensure adequate network security and to closely monitor use of your Internet Services and your home network by anyone accessing your home network, especially children.

e. _Nationwide Wi-Fi Hot Spots (For Internet)._

Access to AT&T's nationwide network of Wi-Fi Hot Spots may be available to you as part of the Service, and the AT&T Wi-Fi Hot Spots will provide you with access to the Internet via certain AT&T Internet access points (Locations). Primarily, this access is provided via a Wi-Fi network using an IEEE 802.11 standard. To access the Wi-Fi Hot Spots, you must have a device that is compatible with the specific Wi-Fi equipment deployed at a Location. Access to the Hot Spots is intended for the limited purposes of assisting with access to the public Internet for e-mail and web browsing or other purposes consistent with the AT&T Wi-Fi Terms of Service, which may be found at att.com/legal/terms.wiFiServices.html. In order to gain access to the Internet at a Location, You may need your Member account information including your Member ID. If you are also an AT&T Mobility customer, you may auto-authenticate at certain Locations without the use of your Member ID. The AT&T Wi-Fi Terms of Service will govern your use of AT&T Wi-Fi Hot Spots.

Similarly, some plans may offer a discount on the Service if you sign up for other AT&T services ("Bundle Discount"). You agree to maintain your Service and any bundled services for the applicable term of the Term Plan or Bundle Discount, as applicable. If you signed up for a Term Plan or a Bundle Discount, the price under the applicable plans is valid until one of the following events occurs, at which time the price of your Service may revert to the then-existing price for such Service: (1) the term of your plan expires. (2) you change your current Service address to another Service address. (3) you drop one of the AT&T services that you were required to purchase to receive the special rate. or (4) AT&T exercises a right under this Agreement to terminate your Member Account's (or any associated Sub Account's or Authorized User's) use of the Service.

5\. Termination or Cancellation of Service a. _Your Decision to Terminate or Continue Service._

You may cancel your Service, but if you do so before the end of any applicable term, you will be subject to any early termination fee which may be associated with that plan as specified in your Customer Service Summary, your Order Confirmation Letter or the applicable Fee Schedule(s) (referred to as an "Early Termination Fee" or "ETF"). At the conclusion of your term, or at all times if you did not agree to a Term Plan, your continued Service will be provided on a month-to-month basis. If you elect to continue Service on a month-to-month basis, you should review the then current Agreement regularly at att.com/internet-terms. The then current Agreement will govern your Service.

You may also be subject to suspension or termination pursuant to Section 6 below. If we terminate your Service and you have a term commitment that is subject to an ETF, we may charge you that ETF in addition to any other rights that we reserve in other provisions of this Agreement.

If we terminate or suspend your Service, your license to use any software provided in connection with the Service is also terminated or suspended (as applicable). If your Service is terminated, AT&T has the right to immediately delete all data, files, and other information stored in or for your account without further notice to you. You must pay all charges for the Service through the date of termination.

c. _Suspension and Termination for Non-payment._

Upon any interruption or loss of either your or AT&T's rights to access any part of the network facilities required to provide your Internet Service, including the interruption or loss of any rights to access the land or buildings in which the facilities are located, AT&T may, in its sole discretion, suspend or terminate all or any portion of your Internet Service. In general and where applicable, AT&T will utilize available public rights of way to access network facilities utilized for providing Services. However, if you are the owner of the location to which your Services are provisioned, it is ultimately your responsibility to secure any necessary rights of access outside of the public rights of way. If you lease or rent the location at which you wish to receive Services, or if the location is located in a MTU type of arrangement, receipt of Services is expressly conditioned on the owner, landlord and/or building manager providing all customary, reasonable and necessary rights and permissions to allow AT&T access to the network facilities necessary to provide your Internet Service. AT&T makes no representation and can't guarantee that the owner, landlord and/or building manager has or will provide the applicable rights and permissions necessary for you to receive Internet Service or any particular grade of Internet Service, and explicitly disclaims any such representation or guarantee. In the event of any interruption or loss of access, AT&T will endeavor to provide you with reasonable advanced notice of any suspension or termination of Internet Service, however the timing of any suspension or termination, as well as the timing of any resumption of Internet Services, are entirely at AT&T's reasonable discretion. In general, and unless otherwise specified, billing will continue for your monthly charges while your Service is suspended.

e. _Restoral Fee and Payment of Past Due Amounts._

If either you or AT&T suspends a Service for any reason set forth herein (other than due to AT&T's loss of access), you must make satisfactory arrangements to pay all past due amounts in order to have that Service restored. You will also be required to pay a Service Restoral Fee of no more than $50 per incident of suspension or termination of a particular Service (subject to applicable law and except as may otherwise have been expressly agreed in writing). Please see the applicable Fee Schedules at www.att.com/ConsumerInternetFees and/or www.att.com/BusinessInternetFees to determine the Restoral Fee amount applicable to your particular Service(s). The Restoral Fee will be assessed on the next monthly bill you receive following the resumption of Service.

Any charges you incur in excess of your limit become immediately due. Upon determination solely by AT&T of satisfactory payment history or as required by law, AT&T may begin refunding of deposits through bill credits, cash payments, or as otherwise determined solely by AT&T. If you are delinquent in any payment to us, you also authorize us to report any late payment or nonpayment to credit reporting agencies.

b. _Billing._

In the event you are enrolled, or later enroll, in an automatic payment or electronic funds transfer plan, you agree that all sums described herein may be charged, at AT&T's option, to the account number provided for such automatic payment or electronic funds transfer plan. When payment is made by credit card or debit card, payment will also be subject to the terms and conditions established by the credit or debit card issuer.

You are prohibited from infringing, publishing, submitting, copying, uploading, downloading, posting, transmitting, reproducing, or distributing software, video or audio content, or any other material that is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, any other type of intellectual property rights, trademark laws (by rights of privacy or publicity) or other proprietary right of any party unless you own or control the rights thereto or have received all necessary consent to do the same. This prohibition includes the use of any material or information including images or photographs that are made available through the Service(s). **AT&T assumes no responsibility, and you assume all risks, regarding the determination of whether material is in the public domain, or may otherwise be used by you for such purposes.**

AT&T respects the intellectual property rights of others. In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") and other applicable laws, AT&T has adopted and maintains a policy that provides for termination of Service in appropriate circumstances of the account(s) of customers who are repeat copyright infringers. AT&T may limit, suspend or terminate your service at any time with or without notice to you.

If you believe the copyright to your work has been infringed in connection with an AT&T service that involves system caching, information residing on systems or networks at the direction of users, or information location tools as described in 17 U.S.C. §§ 512(b)–(d), please provide the information listed at https://www.att.com/legal/terms.dmca.html to the designated agent listed at https://www.att.com/legal/terms.dmca.html. AT&T has no obligation to investigate possible copyright infringements with respect to materials transmitted on its systems. However, AT&T will process valid notifications of claimed infringement under the DMCA. For further information regarding such notifications, see https://www.att.com/legal/terms.dmca.html.

AT&T also maintains the AT&T Copyright Alert Program that allows copyright holders to notify AT&T of claimed infringement occurring on AT&T's transitory digital network communications services pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(a). Under the program, content owners may submit notifications to AT&T of alleged copyright infringement based on information they have independently collected by joining peer-to-peer networks, in accordance with the industry standard Automated Copyright Notice System. AT&T then will attempt to identify a subscriber account if the content owner has detected an IP address utilized by an AT&T subscriber and forward a copyright alert to the subscriber account, advising the account holder of the allegation and providing information about online copyright infringement. If a subscriber receives additional alerts, we may temporarily redirect the account holder's broadband Internet access service to a webpage where the account holder must review material on the importance of copyright and the lawful use of content available over the Internet. Upon completion of this review, such redirection will be discontinued and the subscriber's service will be restored to normal. After this stage, if a subscriber continues to receive additional alerts, AT&T may take further action consistent with 17 U.S.C. § 512(i), which may ultimately result in termination of the subscriber/accountholder's broadband Internet access service. Account holders' personally identifiable information is protected throughout this process. AT&T will not provide such information to content owners unless required to do so by court order. For more information about AT&T's Copyright Alert Program, please go to: https://copyright.att.net/home.

AT&T's policies may be revised from time to time and, in addition, AT&T may in its sole discretion voluntarily participate, on terms acceptable to AT&T, in copyright alert and graduated response programs with other stakeholders.

c. _Use by Children._

Please remember that the Service is designed to appeal to a broad audience. It is your responsibility to determine whether the features provided through the Service are appropriate for a minor.

AT&T suggests that you take advantage of the access controls offered with the Service, which allow you, as the Member Account holder, to block access to certain types of web content you may feel are inappropriate for minors.

In the event that AT&T adopts a network management practice which will apply to your Service, we will provide you with a notice, by web posting, bill insert, email, letter and/or other appropriate means, which describes the network management practice, explains how it will work, and explains how it could impact your Service.

13\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION WITH AT&T BY BINDING ARBITRATION

**PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.**

Consumer Customers: See Arbitration sections below. Business Customers: See Schedule 6.

Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by calling our customer service department at 1-800-288-2020. **In the unlikely event that AT&T's customer service department is unable to resolve a complaint you may have to your satisfaction (or if AT&T has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.** Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. **Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis. class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.** For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $75,000, AT&T will pay all costs of the arbitration. Moreover, in arbitration you are entitled to recover attorneys' fees from AT&T to at least the same extent as you would be in court.

In addition, under certain circumstances (as explained below), AT&T will pay you more than the amount of the arbitrator's award and will pay your attorney (if any) twice his or her reasonable attorneys' fees if the arbitrator awards you an amount that is greater than what AT&T has offered you to settle the dispute.

**_Arbitration Agreement_**

1.  AT&T and you agree to arbitrate **all disputes and claims** between you and AT&T. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:
    
    *   claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;  
          
        
    *   claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);  
          
        
    *   claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class. and  
          
        
    *   claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.
    
    References to "AT&T", "you", and "us" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of the Service under this or prior Agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies, can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. **YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND AT&T ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.** This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.
    
2.  A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice to AT&T should be addressed to: Office for Dispute Resolution, AT&T, 1025 Lenox Park Blvd., Atlanta, GA 30319 ("Notice Address"). The Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute. and (2) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). If AT&T and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, you or AT&T may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by AT&T or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or AT&T is entitled.  
      
    **You may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate arbitration from here: att.com/arbitration-forms.**  
      
    
3.  After AT&T receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $75,000. (The filing fee currently is $200, but is subject to change by the arbitration provider. If you are unable to pay this fee, AT&T will pay it directly upon receiving a written request at the Notice Address). The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. (You may obtain information that is designed for non-lawyers about the arbitration process at att.com/arbitration-information.) The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide. Unless AT&T and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
    
    Except as otherwise provided for herein, AT&T will pay all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse AT&T for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.
    
4.  If, after finding in your favor in any respect on the merits of your claim, the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of AT&T's last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, then AT&T will:
    
    *   pay you the greater of the award or $10,000 ("the alternative payment"), whichever is greater. and
    *   pay your attorney, if any, twice the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs), that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration ("the attorney premium").
    
    If AT&T did not make a written offer to settle the dispute before an arbitrator was selected, you and your attorney will be entitled to receive the alternative payment and the attorney premium, respectively, if the arbitrator awards you any relief on the merits. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.
    
5.  The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed in paragraph (d) supplements any right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law. Thus, if you would be entitled to a larger amount under the applicable law, this provision does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding you that amount. However, you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or costs. Although under some laws AT&T may have a right to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, AT&T agrees that it will not seek such an award.
6.  The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. **YOU AND AT&T AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.** Further, unless both you and AT&T agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific proviso is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.
7.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if AT&T makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) during the period of time that you are receiving Services, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.

1\. _Inside Wire._

When ordering AT&T Internet Service, you will be responsible for obtaining Inside Wire (IW) in the form of copper wire or fiber optic cable between AT&T's network termination interface at your building and the gateway equipment located at the customer premises. You may have the option of ordering IW from AT&T or installing your own IW. If you elect to install your own IW, the IW must be installed and available for use by AT&T Technicians before you order AT&T Internet Service. If inside wire service is ordered from AT&T, it is Customer's full responsibility to obtain landlord permission or approvals for such inside wiring. For AT&T Internet for Business (fiber-based only), any determination of whether the inside wire work will be provided by you or AT&T will be made at the time the installation technician is dispatched and surveys the job.

2\. _Inside Wire - Disclaimer of Warranties._

If inside wire is provided by AT&T, Customer will upon completion of installation have full ownership and responsibility for such inside wire. **AT&T MAKES NO WARRANTY TO CUSTOMER OR ANY OTHER PARTY FOR ANY WORK OR MATERIALS CONSTITUTING OR ASSOCIATED WITH ANY INSIDE WIRE. AT&T EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE, AND AT&T HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY TO MAINTAIN, UPDATE, REPAIR, REPLACE, DE-INSTALL, OR REMOVE ANY INSTALLED INSIDE WIRE.**

3\. Local Wi-Fi.

Depending upon the Internet Service you purchase, your Internet Service may include Wi-Fi enabled local area networking equipment ("Wi-Fi Equipment") in order to help you allow Wi-Fi enabled devices to wirelessly connect to your Internet Service ("Local Wi-Fi"). (See the Applicable Schedule for details about what kind of Wi-Fi networking equipment many be included with the particular Internet Service you are purchasing.)

In order to use Local Wi-Fi, you must have Wi-Fi enabled devices that (a) meet U.S. and WiFi Alliance standards. (b) are compatible with the Wi-Fi network being generated by the applicable Wi-Fi Equipment. and (c) are capable of running IP and related protocols. The Wi-Fi enabled device you are utilizing must be in close enough proximity to the Wi-Fi Equipment to achieve connectivity with the Local Wi-Fi. Actual Local Wi-Fi coverage and quality may vary depending upon the location of the Wi-Fi Equipment, the location of the applicable Wi-Fi enabled device and conditions in and around the premises in which both the Equipment and the Wi-Fi enabled device operate.

Local Wi-Fi is designed to provide you with the highest speed available from the network at any given point in time, subject to the many different factors that can affect network performance. AT&T's most recent generation of Wi-Fi Equipment generally supports the IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac standard, although older Wi-Fi Equipment may only support the IEEE 802.11b or IEEE 80.11b/g standards. The theoretical maximum speed you may be capable of achieving from your Home Wi-Fi will depend heavily on which IEEE 802.11 standard is supported by the Wi-Fi Equipment you have as well as which IEEE 802.11 standard is supported by the particular device you are utilizing. (By way of example only, IEEE 802.11b offers a theoretical maximum of 11 Mbps while IEEE 802.11n offers a theoretical maximum of 600 Mbps. Even if the Wi-Fi Equipment at your location is capable of supporting IEEE 802.11n, if you are utilizing an older device that is only capable of supporting the older IEEE 802.11b standard your theoretical maximum speed will be limited to 11 Mbps.)

Although the IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac standards have theoretical maximum speeds ranging from over ten Mbps to over a gigabit per second, depending on which standard applies, actual Wi-Fi speeds will be substantially lower than the theoretical maximum speeds which describe the physical throughput rate including Wi-Fi protocol communications. The result is that the maximum you can receive may not exceed 40%-50% of the theoretical maximum Wi-Fi standard speed and may be significantly lower depending on other applicable factors. In addition to the factors discussed above, the actual speed you experience over Wi-Fi will depend in part on the speed of the connection between the Wi-Fi network you are accessing and the destination you want to reach on the Internet, which may be significantly below the theoretical maximum speed of the service. (By way of example only, if you order AT&T Internet 25, with a download speed range of between 15 Mbps and 25 Mbps according to the AT&T Speed Tier page, even if the Wi-Fi Equipment at your location and the device you are utilizing are both capable of supporting the IEEE 802.11n standard with a theoretical maximum speed of 600 Mbps, the theoretical maximum internet download speed with your device connected to your Local Wi-Fi will never exceed 25 Mbps.)

4\. Local Area Network Management.

Although AT&T reserves the right to manage any equipment used to access any Internet Service, you are solely responsible for all security measures over your internal network, including any IW, local area network(s) and/or Wi-Fi Equipment. That includes, but is not limited to, access to authorization codes or passwords, as well as any encryption you deem necessary or required. AT&T may provide you with tools or software to assist you in managing one or more aspects of your internal network (which software would then be included in the term "Software" as used herein below), but you remain solely responsible for all aspects of your network, including any activity by employees, customers or other guests that you may allow (either intentionally or unintentionally, through lack of adequate security measures) to access your Internet Services via your local area network and/or Local Wi-Fi. For that reason, AT&T recommends that you take all necessary measures to ensure adequate network security and to closely monitor use of your Internet Services and your local network by anyone accessing your network.

5\. _Service Guides._

**If you are an AT&T FastAccess Business DSL customer, or an AT&T High Speed Internet Business Edition customer, you are also subject to the terms set forth in the service guides for these services, which are incorporated herein by reference and may be found at:**

*   http://serviceguidenew.att.com/sg\_flashPlayerPage/FADSL (Fast Access® Business DSL)
*   http://serviceguidenew.att.com/sg\_flashPlayerPage/HSI (AT&T High Speed Internet Business Edition)

6\. Reimbursement for Time, Materials and Expenses.

If Customer cancels an order for or terminates any Service or Service Component (other than as permitted for default by AT&T), or AT&T cancels an order for or terminates any Service or Service Component for cause, prior to its Service Commencement Date, Customer will reimburse AT&T for time, materials and expenses incurred prior to the effective date of such cancellation or termination, plus any third party charges resulting from the cancellation or termination.

7\. _Arbitration Agreement:_

AT&T and you ("We") agree to resolve all disputes between us through binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, as modified by this provision.

This agreement to arbitrate is broad, and includes disputes of any type between AT&T (including its subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, predecessors, successors, and assigns) and you (including authorized or unauthorized users/beneficiaries of services or devices) under this or prior agreements. **We agree that WE are waiving the right to a trial by jury, to participate in a class action, or to seek remedies beyond the extent necessary to provide individualized relief to, and affecting only, AT&T or You ALone. WE AGREE NOT TO ACT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED OR DE FACTO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC.** Except for matters relating to arbitrability or to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision or the interpretation of the limitations on class, representative, private attorney general, and non-individualized relief, all issues are for the arbitrator to decide.

A party seeking arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). Notice to AT&T must be addressed to: Office of Dispute Resolution, AT&T, 1025 Lenox Park Blvd., Atlanta, GA 30319 ("Notice Address"). The Notice must (a) describe the basis of the claim or dispute. (b) describe the specific relief sought ("Demand"). and (c) provide your AT&T account number. If We do not resolve the claim within 30 days after receipt of the Notice, either of us may commence an arbitration. The amount of any settlement offer made by AT&T or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount of any award on the merits.

Unless We agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county of your billing address. AT&T will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for a claim brought by AT&T or for a claim or Demand valued at up to $25,000 brought by You. If the arbitrator finds that your claim or Demand is frivolous or is brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of fees will be governed by the AAA rules and You agree to reimburse AT&T for fees already paid by AT&T that are your obligation under the AAA rules.

If you complied with the notice procedures above. the value of your claim or Demand is $25,000 or less. and the arbitrator awards you an amount greater than the value of AT&T's last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected (or any amount if AT&T made no offer), AT&T will:

*   Pay you the award or $10,000, whichever is greater ("Alternative Payment"). and
*   Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees and expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing and pursuing your claim in arbitration ("Attorney Award").

The arbitrator may rule on the payment of fees, expenses, and the Alternative Payment and Attorney Award during the proceeding and within 14 days after his/her final ruling on the merits. In assessing whether the award is greater than the value of AT&T's last written settlement offer, the arbitrator may consider only those attorneys' fees or expenses that you incurred through the date of your Notice and which had been awarded to You. You may also recover attorneys' fees and expenses under applicable law, but you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or expenses.

This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and the Federal Arbitration Act governs. This arbitration provision survives termination of this Agreement. As the exclusive alternative to arbitration, AT&T or you may commence an individual action in Small Claims Court. If a court rejects enforcement of any of the limitations on class, representative, private attorney general, or non-individualized relief as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, We agree that if AT&T makes any future change to this arbitration provision (except a change to the Notice Address) during your Service commitment, you may reject any such change by sending AT&T written notice within 30 days of the change to the Notice Address. By rejecting any future change,You agree to arbitrate any dispute in accordance with the language of this provision.

If you are located in Puerto Rico, in addition to pursuing arbitration in accordance with this provision, you may notify the Telecommunications Regulatory Board of Puerto Rico of your grievance. Mail: 500 Ave. Roberto H. Tood (Parada 18), San Juan, Puerto Rico 00907-3941. Phone: 1-787-756-0804 or 1-866-578-5500. Online: jrtpr.gobierno.pr.
