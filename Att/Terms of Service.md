In addition, for those IP Services that utilize AT&T provided web hosting, AT&T reserves the right to decline to provide such services if the content is determined by AT&T to be obscene, indecent, hateful, malicious, racist, defamatory, fraudulent, libelous, treasonous, excessively violent or promoting the use of violence or otherwise harmful to others.

Customers are responsible for ensuring and maintaining security of their systems and the machines that connect to and use IP Service(s), including implementation of necessary patches and operating system updates.

IP Services may not be used to interfere with, gain unauthorized access to, or otherwise violate the security of AT&T's (or another party's) server, network, network access, personal computer or control devices, software or data, or other system, or to attempt to do any of the foregoing.

*   providing guidance, information or assistance with respect to causing damage or security breach to AT&T's network or systems, or to the network of any other IP Service provider;

Customer Responsibilities

Customers remain solely and fully responsible for the content of any material posted, hosted, downloaded/uploaded, created, accessed or transmitted using the IP Services. AT&T has no responsibility for any material created on the AT&T's network or accessible using IP Services, including content provided on third-party websites linked to the AT&T network. Such third-party website links are provided as Internet navigation tools for informational purposes only, and do not constitute in any way an endorsement by AT&T of the content(s) of such sites.

Customers are responsible for taking prompt corrective action(s) to remedy a violation of AUP and to help prevent similar future violations.

AUP Enforcement and Notice

**Customer's failure to observe the guidelines set forth in this AUP may result in AT&T taking actions anywhere from a warning to a suspension or termination of Customer's IP Services.** When feasible, AT&T may provide Customer with a notice of an AUP violation via e-mail or otherwise allowing the Customer to promptly correct such violation.

**AT&T reserves the right, however, to act immediately and without notice to suspend or terminate affected IP Services in response to a court order or government notice that certain conduct must be stopped, or when AT&T reasonably determines that the Customer's use of the affected IP Services may: (1) expose AT&T to sanctions, prosecution, civil action or any other liability. (2) cause harm to or interfere with the integrity or normal operations of AT&T's network or networks with which AT&T is interconnected. (3) interfere with another AT&T Customer's use of IP Services or the Internet. (4) violate any applicable law, rule or regulation. or (5) otherwise present an imminent risk of harm to AT&T or AT&T Customers.**

Copyright Infringement &. Digital Millennium Copyright Act

AT&T respects the intellectual property rights of others. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA" found at 17 U.S.C. § 512) provides that owners of copyrighted works who believe that their rights under U.S. copyright law have been infringed may report alleged infringements to service providers like AT&T. In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable laws, AT&T maintains a policy that provides for the termination of IP Services, under appropriate circumstances, if Customers are found to be a repeat infringer and/or if Customers' IP Services are used repeatedly for infringement (the "Repeat Infringer Policy"). AT&T may terminate IP Services at any time with or without notice to Customers.

AT&T has no obligation to investigate possible copyright infringements with respect to materials transmitted by Customer or any other users of the IP Services. However, AT&T will process valid notifications of claimed infringement under the DMCA, and continued receipt of infringement notifications for Customer's account will be used as a factor in determining whether Customer is a repeat infringer. In addition, AT&T may voluntarily participate, on terms acceptable to AT&T, in copyright alert and graduated response programs.

Incident Reporting

Any complaints (other than claims of copyright infringement) regarding violation of this AUP by an AT&T Customer (or its user) should be directed to abuse@att.net. Where possible, include details that would assist AT&T in investigating and resolving such complaint (e.g., expanded headers, IP address(s), a copy of the offending transmission and any log files).

DMCA Copyright Notifications:

Pursuant to 17 U.S.C. §§ 512(b)–(d), a copyright holder may send AT&T a valid notification of claimed copyright infringement under the DMCA. For further information regarding such notifications, see https://www.att.com/legal/terms.dmca.html. AT&T's designated agent to receive notifications of claimed infringement as described in DMCA subsection 512(c)(3) is:

Registered Copyright Agent  
4825 Creekstone Drive, Suite 300  
Durham, NC 27703  
E-mail: copyright@att.com

Due to the substantial volume of notifications of claimed infringement that AT&T receives and processes, we are unable to accept notices of alleged copyright infringement via this designated agent or email address other than notifications of claimed infringement sent pursuant to Sections 512(b)–(d).

AT&T also provides transitory digital network communications services, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(a). In connection with such services, AT&T provides an online form that copyright holders should use to send notifications related to alleged copyright infringement by its users based on the standards of the Automated Copyright Notice System (ANCS). Copyright holders should use this online form to submit complaints related to alleged peer-to-peer file sharing (i.e. sharing media files via peer-to-peer networking technology), or other forms of copyright notice other than those sent pursuant to Sections 512(b)–(d) of the DMCA ("ISP Conduit Notices"). By submitting complaints using this online form, we are able to more efficiently manage and process ISP Conduit Notices. Due to the substantial volume of copyright notices that AT&T receives, we are unable to guarantee processing of ISP Conduit Notices that are sent by other means. Copyright holders can access AT&T's online form at att.com/p2pnotices. Please note that copyright holders must complete all fields in the online form before submitting.

Contact Information:

Any notification that AT&T sends to its Customers pursuant to this AUP will be sent via e-mail to the e-mail address on file with AT&T, or may be in writing to Customer's address of record. It is Customer's responsibility to promptly notify AT&T of any change of contact information.
