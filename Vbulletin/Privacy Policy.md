    Steps You Can Take
    *   Install malware detection programs that regularly scan your system and incoming traffic for malicious code such as computer viruses, worms, Trojan Horses and spyware. Because viruses and malware are continuously created and modified, regular malware protection software typically requires frequent updates.
    *   Use a firewall to prevent unauthorized access to your device.
    *   Because malware often targets vulnerabilities in existing operating systems, browsers, plug-ins and other programs, software vendors frequently update their products with security patches to guard against known or commonly exploited vulnerabilities. Vendors often try to alert their users and recommend immediate installation of these security patches.
    *   Use a strong password using a combination of letters and numbers that are not easily guessed. Do not share your password with others.
    *   If you use a shared device, always close all active programs and log out before leaving it unattended.
    *   Avoid using a public wireless network, if possible. If you do use a public network, use the most restrictive wireless network settings on your device.
    *   If you use file-sharing programs, be sure to restrict all other folders or directories to "no share".
    *   Be very cautious with any email requesting you to share personal information. On websites, look for the lock symbol on or near your browser's address bar which signifies a secure website before supplying personal information.
