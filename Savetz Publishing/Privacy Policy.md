Privacy Policy
--------------

Savetz Publishing takes online privacy very seriously. We actively protect the privacy of users of our web sites and people who subscribe to our mailing lists.

**Subscription Lists & Email Addresses** — To receive certain services such as mailing lists, you must provide us with your name and email address — without it, we can't send you anything. We hold the names and email addresses of subscribers in the strictest confidence, and will not disclose specific subscriber information unless complying with legal process, preventing fraud or imminent harm, or ensuring the security of our network and services. Subscription lists can be accessed by only a few members of the Savetz Publishing staff and are well protected against theft, tampering, and misuse. Aggregate information about subscription lists (such as the total number of subscribers) may be disclosed.

**Web Server Usage** — Savetz Publishing records information about how people access our web sites. This information includes your IP address (or the DNS name associated with it) and what web software you're using. Unless your IP address or its DNS name identifies you specifically, there's no way to use this connection information to identify a particular user. We may record information about queries submitted to our sites to better understand how people use our features. As with other web access, this information generally cannot be associated with any particular user; in any case, query information is not disclosed to anyone outside our staff. Aggregate information about the usage of Savetz Publishing's web servers may be available to the public.

Savetz Publishing web sites may use cookies to keep track of your online session.

**Editorial Mail** — Email messages sent to Savetz Publishing editorial addresses are considered public statements and become the property of Savetz Publishing. Unless noted otherwise in the message itself, we may publish such messages (including the author's name) in whole or in part. We will not publish the author's email address without permission. We will honor any advance request not to publish a message, or not to publish the correspondent's name or email address.
