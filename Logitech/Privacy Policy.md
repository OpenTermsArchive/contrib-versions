Logitech collects and uses various types of personal data when you use its products and services, which are described within the Logitech Product and Web Privacy Policies.

Logitech shares personal data with third parties for business purposes. Specifically, here are the seven categories of activities for which we share data for business purposes:

* Auditing
* Security
* Debugging and Technical Troubleshooting
* Short term, transient use (personal data is not disclosed to third parties and it is not used to build profiles)
* Performing Services
* Internal Research
* Testing or Product/Service Improvement

If you are a resident of California, you have the right to request to know what personal data has been collected about you, how we use, share and disclose it, and to access that information. You also have the right to request that we delete your personal data, though exceptions under the CCPA may allow us to retain and use certain personal data.

We do not sell your personal data. In limited circumstances we share your personal data for advertising. You can “opt-out” of having your personal data used for this purpose by clicking the “unsubscribe” link in the email; by visiting our Preference Center; or by logging into your Logitech account and navigating to Email Preferences.

You can learn more about how to submit a data rights request through contact details located within this policy. An agent may submit a request on your behalf, but you must provide proof that the agent is authorized to do so by providing the agent with a signed letter giving permission to submit a request on your behalf and you must confirm that authorization directly with us by sending an email to [privacy@logitech.com](mailto:privacy@logitech.com).

We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not deny you goods or services, charge different prices or rates, or provide a different service level for exercising your privacy rights. However, we may offer certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, discounts or quality levels. Any incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal data and will only be collected or processed with your consent.

California’s Shine the Light Law
--------------------------------

Separate from the CCPA, California’s Shine the Light law gives California residents the right to ask companies what personal data they share with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes. We do not disclose your personal data to third parties for the purpose of directly marketing their goods or services to you unless you request it. If you have any questions regarding this policy, or would like to change your preferences, you may contact us at the address listed in this policy.

For this purpose, we use services such as the YouTube API Services and, as a result, you are subject to third party privacy policies such as the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Google's security settings](https://myaccount.google.com/connections?filters=3,4&hl=en). Our apps adhere to the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy), including the Limited Use requirements section.

We have implemented Circle products so that no Logitech employee, contractor, vendor, affiliate, or governmental entity can access unencrypted footage. Every Circle camera has a unique private key and digital certificate, which is used to encrypt communications in transit. The Circle servers use AES 256 Bit Dual Layer Encryption to store your footage encrypted-at-rest.

Data collected is stored directly within the application, on your Device, and on servers in the U.S. or other countries where we or our affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers have facilities. We will retain collected information for as long as needed to provide the service and in accordance with the Logitech Privacy Policy.

Circle Cameras with Apple HomeKit Support

When a Circle camera is connected to the Apple HomeKit ecosystem, Apple controls the data generated and passed to HomeKit and is responsible for the privacy and handling of your audio and video content. We have no ability or mechanism to access any HomeKit audio/video data.<.p>

If a Circle camera is only set up in HomeKit, the camera will still periodically check our servers for firmware update availability. This involves sending the model, firmware version, and the country code of operation to our servers.
