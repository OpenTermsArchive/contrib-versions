We will retain collected information for as long as needed to provide the service and in accordance with the Logitech Privacy Policy.

Circle Cameras with Apple HomeKit Support

If a Circle camera is only set up in HomeKit, the camera will still periodically check our servers for firmware update availability. This involves sending the model, firmware version, and the country code of operation to our servers.
