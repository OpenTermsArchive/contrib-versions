#### Actively Submitted Data

If you call us, send us an email, or fill out a form on one of our Sites, we use the information you provide to respond to your request or to otherwise communicate with you or assist you.

#### Passively Provided Data

When you access our Sites, depending on your opt-in choices, certain information about your computer or mobile device is shared with us, which may include the activities you perform on our Sites, the type of hardware and software you are using, (such as your operating system or browser), information stored in cookies, IP address, access times, the web pages from which you came, the regions from which you navigate the web page, and the web pages you access. We use this information to better understand the interests of the users of our Sites, to improve our Sites, services, and products.

We do not currently respond to “Do Not Track” signals in browsers as we are trying to provide a customized website experience.

#### Cookies

We do not sell your personal data.

We may share your personal data with third parties under certain circumstances. We use affiliated and unaffiliated service providers that help us process personal data to deliver services and run our business subject to strict confidentiality agreements. For example, service providers help deliver the following functions:

| **Service Description** | **Data Provided** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Customer Support | Contact data, Inquiry data | To help troubleshoot and support products and services |
| E-Commerce Functionality | Contact data, Interactions with website | To facilitate sales of our products online |
| Promotions and Relevant News | Contact data, Cookie data | To provide information and incentives for our products and services |
| Website performance | Cookie data, Interactions with website | To enable functionality and features while on our websites |
| Cookie Opt-In Manager | Cookie data | To provide the ability to choose cookies to be allowed on our websites |

These companies are required to abide by our data protection and security requirements and are not allowed to use personal data they receive from us for any other purpose.

We may disclose your personal information to

1.  comply with relevant laws, regulatory requirements, and to respond to lawful requests, court orders, and legal process;
2.  to protect and defend the rights or property of us or third parties, including enforcing agreements, policies, and terms of use;
3.  in an emergency, including to protect the safety of our employees or any person; or
4.  in connection with investigating or preventing fraud.

We may share your personal data for purposes of a business deal, or negotiation of a business deal, involving sale or transfer of all or a part of our business or assets. These deals can include any merger, financing, acquisition, divestiture, joint venture or partnership, or bankruptcy transaction or proceeding.

We also freely use and share aggregated and pseudonymous information for performance and analytics purposes that cannot be used to identify you individually.

#### Children

We do not knowingly collect or maintain information about persons under 13 years of age. If we learn that information about persons under 13 years of age has been collected on or through the Sites, we will take appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 years of age who has registered for an account or service on our Sites, please contact us using the contact information below to have that child’s account or service terminated and personal information deleted.

#### Data Retention

We retain personal data for as long as necessary to provide functionality and fulfill the transactions you have requested, or for other legitimate purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. Because these needs can vary for different data types, the context of our interactions with you or your use of our Sites, actual retention periods can vary significantly.

#### Data Security

We use TLS certificates, encryption, data access limitations, anti-virus software, and firewalls to reduce the risk of unauthorized access to personal data. No data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network is entirely secure. Be mindful of security risks when you transmit personal data to us and when you post information in our public forums.

If you would like to report any security issues in any of our products, please fill out the form and required attachments and send it to [Logitech Security](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/legal/security-vulnerability-reporting.html).
