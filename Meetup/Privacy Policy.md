Certain information about yourself is optional to provide. Your choice of groups is also optional, but we are required to process this information in order to administer your account, and to indicate that you are a member of the groups that you join. See [Section 2](#h_490757dc-fe47-456f-83c3-dab26e74f4d3) to learn how we will use the information that you provide to personalize our recommendations and other content to you.

On occasion, the information that you give us when you join a group may imply information about your beliefs, political views, health conditions, or your sexual identity. This, and other kinds of sensitive information, is given special protection in accordance with applicable law. Posting personal or sensitive information about others without their permission is against our [Community Guidelines](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/sections/360000683791-Community-Guidelines).

1.  **Social Media Services**. If you register or log into your account through a third-party social media service, we will have access to some of your third-party account information from that service, including identifiers, such as your name and other information in that account, and used for purposes such as improving your Meetup recommendations. We may also have access to third-party account information if you use the Platform feature to share a link.

### 2.4 Legal Basis for Processing

If you are in a jurisdiction that requires a specific legal basis for processing personal data, our legal basis for collecting and using the information described above will depend on the type of information and the specific context in which we collect it.

1.  We process information about you in order to provide our services in accordance with our [Terms of Service](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027447252), for example, to allow you to join groups or to display your profile to other members; to allow us to send you important service updates; and to perform a contract.
2.  We also process information about you where it is in our legitimate interests to do so and not overridden by your rights (for example, in some cases for direct marketing, fraud prevention, network and information systems security, responding to your communications, the operation of networks of groups by the network administrators, and improving our Platform).
3.  Sometimes you provide us with sensitive information about you; for instance, the mere fact of joining a certain group may indicate information about your health, religion, political views, or sexual identity. Joining such groups or posting information on the Platform about these topics is entirely voluntary and, depending on the settings of the group and your profile (e.g., public or private), our legal basis for processing any sensitive information is either that you manifestly make it public or your explicit consent.
4.  In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to process information about you, or may otherwise need the information to protect your vital interests or those of another person. For example, we may process information, if we believe doing so is required by, or in accordance with, applicable law, regulation, legal process, or audits.

3\. Sharing Of Information
--------------------------

_**Summary:** We may disclose personal information about you, including:_

1.  _to members or social media services, depending on how you engage with the Platform.  Information that is public on our platform is accessible to others both on and off the Platform;_
2.  _to our third-party service providers who help us to operate or improve our Platform;_
3.  _to authorities to comply with legal obligations or requests and to protect and defend our rights and property;_ 
4.  _to an affiliate or successor entity or otherwise as part of a corporate transaction;_ 
5.  _among our businesses and affiliated companies; and_
6.  _when you direct us to share your information._ 

_We may also share information in a manner that does not identify you, such as de-identified or aggregated information. Such information is not subject to this Privacy Policy._

We do not sell or share information about you except as described in this Privacy Policy. 

### 3.1 Through Our Platform

We share some of the information that we collect by displaying it on our Platform according to your member profile and account settings. Some information, such as username, is always public. Some information, such as interests, is public by default, but can be hidden on our Platform. Some information, such as group memberships, will always be visible to other members of that Meetup group, and may be public, depending on the settings of that group. We recommend that you check the group settings and what information will be available before joining the group to ensure that you are happy with the information that is visible to others. For more information, see this article on [Account Privacy and Visibility](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001655712) and this article on [Group Content Visibility](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002921751). 

Information that is public on our Platform is visible to others on and off the Platform.

### 3.2 Group Networks

If you are a member of a group, this group may now or in the future become part of a network of groups known as a “Meetup Pro” network. Members who administer a Meetup Pro network, known as “network administrators” have access to the content within their groups, including information about group participants. Network administrators find it helpful to have access to the email addresses of organizers and other members of groups within their networks, to easily communicate with and administer the groups. Therefore, we will provide ways for you to share your email address with your group’s network administrator. See this article for more information about [Network Administrators, Organizers, and their Members](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002797432).

### 3.3 With Our Service Providers

We may use service providers in connection with operating and improving the Platform to assist with certain business purposes, such as payment processing, email transmission, conducting surveys or contests, data hosting, managing our ads, and some aspects of our technical and customer support. These service providers, which include data analytics providers, may access, process, and store information about you on our behalf for the purposes we authorize, subject to confidentiality obligations.

### 3.4 Following The Law And Protecting Meetup

We may access, preserve, and disclose information about you to government entities and other third parties, including the content of messages, if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, applicable law, regulation, legal process, or audits. We may also disclose information about you if we believe that your actions are inconsistent with our [Terms of Service](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027447252) or related guidelines and policies, or if necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of, or prevent fraud or abuse of, Meetup or others. 

### 3.5 Social Sharing And Other Tools

The Platform may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools which let you share actions that you take on our Platform with third-party services, and vice versa. Such features let you share information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you have chosen with the service. For more information, see this article on [Sharing Meetup events on Social Media](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002882691) and this article on [Connecting your Social Media Account](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002878451). The third-party services' use of the information will be governed by the third parties’ privacy policies, and we do not control the third parties’ use of the shared data. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please review the privacy policies of the services that provide these features.

### 3.6 Affiliate Sharing And Merger, Sale, Or Other Asset Transfers

If Meetup is involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of our assets, information about you may be shared, sold, or transferred as part of that transaction. We may also share information about you with current or future corporate parents, subsidiaries, or affiliates.

### 3.7 Other Situations

We may de-identify or aggregate information about you and share it freely, so that you can no longer be identified. Such information is not subject to this Privacy Policy.

We may also share information about you with your consent or at your direction or where we are legally entitled to do so. For example, your information may be shared with event sponsors and others as described to you when you RSVP to an event.  Your information also is made available to other group members and event organizers when you RSVP for and participate in an event.

### 4.1 Analytics and Advertising Services Provided by Others

We and others may use cookies, web beacons, device identifiers, and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Platform and other websites and online services. See our [Cookie Policy](https://www.meetup.com/cookie_policy/) for details about these technologies and the information that they collect, use, or share, including how you may be able to control or disable these services.

### 4.2 Transfer Of Information To The U.S. And Other Countries

**Meetup is based in the United States**. Information about you will be transferred to, and processed in, the U.S. and countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country and, in some cases, may not be as protective. We have taken appropriate safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses, to require that your information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### 4.3 Security

We employ technical and organizational measures designed to protect your information that is under our control and that we process on your behalf from unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, or disposal, both during transmission and once we receive it. For example, we store all information that you provide to us on servers on which security controls are used. We train employees regarding our data privacy policies and procedures, and authorize employees to access personal information as required for their role. We use firewalls designed to protect against intruders and test for network vulnerabilities. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure.

Where you have a password, which enables you to use our services, you are responsible for keeping this password complex, secure, and confidential. If you would like to update or change your password, you may select the “Forgot your password?” link on the login page. You will be sent an email that allows you to reset your password.

### 4.4 Data Retention

We may temporarily de-activate your account if you have not logged in for six months or more. You may contact us if you wish to reactivate your account.

We retain certain information that we collect from you while you visit or are a member of the Platform, and in certain cases where you have deleted your account, for the following business purposes:

1.  So you can use our Platform;
2.  To ensure that we do not communicate with you if you have asked us not to;
3.  To provide you with a refund, if entitled;
4.  To provide accurate accounting information to other members about the groups that they organize or administer, and associated memberships;
5.  To better understand the traffic to our Platform so that we can provide all members with the best possible experience;
6.  To detect and prevent abuse of our Platform, illegal activities and breaches of our Terms of Service; and
7.  To comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your information, we will either delete it or take steps to de-identify or anonymize it in accordance with applicable law.

### 4.5 Policy Scope

This Privacy Policy does not apply to information that you have provided or made accessible to third parties, such as other members, including group organizers and network administrators, and others with whom you may share information about yourself. Our Platform may direct you to a third-party service, such as social media services, or a portion of our Platform may be controlled by a third party (typically through the use of a frame or pop-up window separate from other content on our Platform). Disclosure of information to these third parties is subject to the relevant third party’s privacy policy. We are not responsible for the third-party privacy policy or content, even if we link to those services from our Platform or if we share information with these third parties.

Members, including group organizers and network administrators, are directly responsible for complying with all requirements of applicable privacy laws in connection with the information that they obtain and process for the purposes of managing their contacts, organizing and communicating with groups, or administering networks.

### 4.6 Revisions To This Policy

We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will provide notice to you by publishing the most current version and revising the date at the top of this page. If we make any material change to this policy, we will provide additional notice to you, such as by sending you an email or displaying a prominent notice on our Platform.

Your mobile device settings may also give you the option to choose whether to allow us to view your geolocation on a continuous basis, only when using the app, or never.
