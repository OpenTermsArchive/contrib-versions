[Download Terms of Service](https://web.tresorit.com/l#7Yhkrfp11ZaXBrY_Y8LWsg)

1.  **Service**
    
    1.  **Scope:** This Agreement governs the access and use of all products and services owned and offered by Tresorit, including applications, websites and technologies or functions and relating Software (the "Services"). You may access and use the Services in accordance with this Agreement, the Acceptable Use Policy, the Tresorit Privacy Policy and the Data Processing Addendum (if applicable).
        
    2.  **Resellers:** As a Customer, you may purchase a subscription directly from a third party ("Reseller"). In such cases, in addition to this Agreement, separate terms and conditions with the Reseller may apply to your access to the Service. You expressly acknowledge and agree that Tresorit is entitled to enforce this Agreement against you and that Resellers are not authorized to make any promises or commitments on Tresorit's behalf. Tresorit is not bound by any obligations other than what is specified in the documents listed above in clause 1.1.
        
    3.  **Changes in Service:** We are always looking for ways to make the Services better, smarter, and more secure. To live up to that, we may need to modify features and functionality from time to time. If we change the Services during the term of this Agreement in a manner that materially reduces functionality or limit access to certain features, we will notify Customers at the email address associated with their account. After receiving the notice, as a Customer, you may terminate this Agreement within thirty days. In such case, you will be provided with a pro-rata refund of any pre-payment. This termination right will not apply to updates made to features provided as Beta Services.
        
2.  **Confidentiality of Encrypted Content**
    
    1.  **Encryption:** You acknowledge that by using the Service, the files uploaded and/or shared through the Service ("Customer Files") are encrypted by client-side encryption before they leave the User's location ("Encrypted Content"). According to the best of Tresorit's knowledge and the current state of the art, Encrypted Content cannot be decrypted or inverted by Tresorit or any unauthorized third party.
        
    2.  **Collaboration:** When you upload and/or share Customer Files through the Service, Encrypted Content can only be decrypted by you by accessing your account and by persons with whom Encrypted Content is specifically shared with ("Collaborator"). If you are a Company Administered User, or the relevant Collaborator is a Company Administered User, in certain cases your Administrator or the Administrator of your Collaborator may also have cryptographic access to the shared Encrypted Content in accordance with section 5 (Business Administrator) below.
        
    3.  **Roles and permissions:** You understand that Encrypted Content will be accessible by Collaborators to the extent the relevant Collaborators have been granted access. Your and Collaborators' rights are defined in accordance with your "permission" that defines whether you can modify, delete or reshare the Encrypted Content. Before sharing Encrypted Content, please consider the permissions of the relevant Collaborator.
        
    4.  **Password:** Tresorit has no access to passwords and there is no way for Tresorit to recover passwords relating to your account. Tresorit is not liable if Encrypted Content cannot be decrypted due to password loss. It is strongly recommended that Users keep backups of any content on their own systems.
        
3.  **Customer Files**
    
    1.  **Limited Permission:** This Agreement does not grant Tresorit any ownership over the contents of Customer Files or over Customer's intellectual property, except for the limited rights that are reasonably necessary for Tresorit to provide the Services in accordance with this Agreement, in particular to store, backup or transfer (as set out in clause 4.3) Customer Files and Service Data.
        
    2.  **Content:** You understand that Tresorit uses strong cryptography algorithms to protect Customer Files and as a Customer, you are fully and solely responsible and accountable for the content of Customer Files. By using the Services, you guarantee that you have all required permissions for each Customer File â€“ including copyright and other intellectual property rights â€“ to distribute, transfer, store and/or make the content available online through the Services.
        
    3.  **Company Administered Users:** As a Company Administered User or Administrator, you acknowledge that Customer Files are owned by Customer and this Agreement provides Customer with many choices and control over Customer Files uploaded and/or shared within the Services, as set out in section 5 (Business Administrator). In addition, depending on the relevant Collaborator's rights, Collaborators may be able to modify, delete or reshare the Encrypted Content.
        
4.  **Data processing and transfer**
    
    1.  **Personal Data:** In order to operate and provide the Services, Tresorit collects certain non-encrypted information ("Service Data") that may include Personal Data. Further information about how Tresorit collects, uses and discloses Personal Data is set out in Tresorit's Privacy Policy and the Data Processing Agreement (if applicable). Customer acknowledges that, due to client-side encryption, Encrypted Content is not deemed to be Personal Data from the perspective of Tresorit, as Tresorit cannot use encrypted information to identify any individual.
        
    2.  **Sub-processors:** Customer agrees that in providing the Services, Tresorit will engage entities within the Tresorit group and authorized service providers, to process Encrypted Content and Service Data ("Sub-processors"), including and without limitation, any associated Personal Data under this Agreement within the EEA, the United States and in other countries and territories. The list of Sub-processors is available at: [https://tresorit.com/used-trusted-third-parties](https://tresorit.com/used-trusted-third-parties).
        
    3.  **Data transfers:** Customer agrees that Tresorit and its Sub-processors may transfer Encrypted Content and Service Data between their servers, to the devices of Users and/or Collaborators, and as a result, Users and Collaborators may have access to Customer Files in locations other than Customer's country. Tresorit may provide the ability for Customer to select a major geographic area for data storage purposes. In such case, Tresorit will store Customer Files within that area chosen by Customer.
        
    4.  **Data Processing on behalf Customer:** If Customer has an account for business purposes ("Business Subscription"), by entering into this Agreement Customer instructs Tresorit to process Personal Data on its behalf and to provide the Services in accordance with Tresorit features and functionalities or as further documented by mutually-agreed upon written instructions given by Customer and accepted by Tresorit. Customer acknowledges that its Company Administered Users' use of the Services is subject to Tresorit's Privacy Policy and understand that it identifies how Tresorit collects, stores, and uses certain information. Customer will make Company Administered Users familiar with the Privacy Policy.
        
    5.  **Data Processing Agreement:** If Customer has a Business Subscription and is subject to EU Data Protection Laws, Customer agrees to the Data Processing Addendum (available through the Tresorit application). Customer cannot process any information via the Services that falls within the definition of "Protected Health Information" under the HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 C.F.R. Section 164.051) unless Customer and Tresorit have entered into a separate HIPAA Business Associate Agreement.
        
5.  **Business Administrators**
    
    1.  **Administrator rights:** In the case of certain Service Plans, Customer may appoint selected Company Administered User(s) as "Administrator(s)" and may change this role at any time. Administrators may have the ability to monitor, restrict or terminate access to accounts relating to Customer's subscription ("Company Administered User Accounts"). In addition, Administrators may be entitled to request different or additional services (including setting up policies and two-step verification for Customer accounts), assist in third-party product integrations, and accept notices, disclosures, and terms and conditions.
        
    2.  **Advanced control:** Customer may set up advanced control in his own Business Subscription. Upon the consent of Company Administered Users to advanced control, a designated Administrator will gain cryptographic access to their Encrypted Content ("Recovery Administrator"). In such case, Tresorit will continue to store Customer Files in accordance with clause 2.1 above, i.e. Encrypted Content cannot be decrypted or inverted by Tresorit or any unauthorized third party. However, the designated Recovery Administrator will have access to the recovery key and might also reset Company Administered Users' passwords and may be able to access, disclose, restrict or remove information in or from Company Administered User Accounts.
        
    3.  **Joining a Business Subscription:** As a Customer, you may convert your private account into a Company Administered User Account by joining a Business Subscription. In that case, all data stored with Tresorit (including Encrypted Content and Service Data) will also be transferred into the Business Subscription. Be careful to join the right organization's Business Subscription because after joining the Business Subscription, you may not able to convert it back without deleting all data stored within the Service.
        
    4.  **Business Email:** If the primary email address of Customer's account is owned by an organization and was assigned to Customer as an employee, contractor or member of the organization, the Administrator may require that Customer joins the relevant Business Subscription and to convert his private account. In this case, Customer may not be able to use the Service without accepting the terms of that Business Subscription and without joining that Business Subscription.
        
    5.  **Managed Services:** If Customer purchases the Services via a Reseller, Customer may appoint any of the Reseller's personnel as Administrators of Customer's account. In this case, Customer Files are stored in accordance with clause 2.1 above, i.e. Encrypted Content cannot be decrypted or inverted by Tresorit or any unauthorized third party, but Customer acknowledges that, the Reseller may be able to control and have access to account information, including Customer Files and Service Data.
        
6.  **Customer responsibility**
    
    1.  **Eligibility to use:** You represent and warrant that: (i) you are of legal age (18 years of age or older or otherwise of legal age in your resident jurisdiction) and competent to agree to this Agreement and (ii) you have validly entered into this agreement and have the legal power to do so.
        
    2.  **Compliance:** As between the parties, Customer is responsible for compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and the Acceptable Use Policy, including for any and all activities that occur under Company Administered User Accounts. Customer is solely responsible for compliance with laws and regulations applicable to Customer's and Company Administered User's use of the Services. Customer maintains all responsibility for determining whether the Services are accurate or sufficient for its purposes.
        
    3.  **Customer Administration of the Services:** Customer is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of passwords and Customer accounts. Customer, and not Tresorit, is responsible for the internal management or administration of the Service. The Services support logins using two-step authentication. If a two-step verification method is switched on for Customer's account(s), Tresorit will not let access to the relevant accounts without two-step verification.
        
    4.  **Customer Passwords:** Customer understands and accepts that if Customer's or a Company Administered User's password is lost, he cannot get access to his account. To prevent the loss of files, Customer will maintain, protect, update, secure and backup his computer and his locally stored and synchronized Customer Files. Customer acknowledges that Tresorit does not offer back-up services but rather a cloud storage sync and share service.
        
    5.  **Embargoed Countries:** The Software includes cryptographic software that may be subject to import or export controls or other restrictions under the laws of the country in which Customer intends to use the Services. It is Customer's sole obligation and responsibility to check such limitations before using the Services and to comply with such restrictions and limitations.
        
        Customer shall not access or use the Services if Customer located in any jurisdiction in which the provision of the Services, Software or other components is prohibited under the laws of Switzerland, the United States or the European Union or other applicable laws or regulations (a "Prohibited Jurisdiction") and Customer shall not provide access to the Services to any government, entity or individual located in any Prohibited Jurisdiction. Customer represents and warrants that (i) Customer is not prohibited from receiving Swiss, EU or US exports; (ii) Customer is not a national of, or a company registered in, any Prohibited Jurisdiction; (iii) Customer shall not permit Users to access or use the Services in violation of any U.S. or other applicable export embargoes, prohibitions or restrictions; and (iv) Customer shall comply with all applicable export laws regarding the transmission of technical data.
        
    6.  **Security of devices:** Without prejudice to clause 3.2 above, parts of encryption keys may be stored on Customer's and its Users' device (memory or persistent storage), or Tresorit may provide you a printable recovery encryption key. Even in cases where such encryption key is provided to Customer, Encrypted Content cannot be decrypted or inverted by Tresorit or any unauthorized third party. Customer is responsible for devices relating to its Business Subscription and any copy of printed or otherwise archived recovery keys. Tresorit cannot be held liable if Customer's device is stolen or hacked and an unauthorized person gets access to Encrypted Data by accessing a locally stored copy, or by obtaining un-protected passwords or any encryption keys stored on the relevant device.
        
    7.  **Internet connection:** You understand that certain functions of the Services require Internet connection. You are responsible for procuring and maintaining the network connections that connect your network to the Services, including, but not limited to, "browser" software that supports protocols used by Tresorit. You are responsible for obtaining and maintaining all connectivity, computer software, hardware and other equipment needed for access to and use of the Services.
        
7.  **Third-party requests**
    
    1.  **Customer Responsibility:** Because of client-side encryption specified in clause 2.1, Encrypted Content cannot be decrypted or inverted by Tresorit or any unauthorized third party. Accordingly, Customer is responsible for responding to any request from a third-party relating to Customers', including Company Administered Users', use of the Services ("Third-party Request"), including Customer Files and Service Data, via its own access to information. Customer will seek to obtain information required to respond to Third-party Requests and will contact Tresorit only if it cannot obtain such information despite diligent efforts.
        
    2.  **Tresorit Responsibility:** If Tresorit receives a Third-party Request relating to Customer, then â€“ to the extent allowed by law and by the terms of the Third-party Request â€“ Tresorit will make commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) notify Customer promptly of Tresorit's receipt of a Third-party Request; (ii) comply with Customer's commercially reasonable requests regarding its efforts to oppose a Third-party Request; and (iii) provide Customer with information or tools required for Customer to respond to the Third-party Request, if Customer is otherwise unable to respond to the Third-party Request.
        
        If Customer fails to respond promptly to any Third-party Request, Tresorit may, but will not be obligated to do so. In particular, Tresorit may provide Service Data in response to a Third-party Request, respecting all limitations in clause 2.1, if Tresorit has a reason to believe that it is required: (i) to comply with any law or order issued by any legal authority; (ii) to avoid infringement of the rights of a third party; (iii) to protect the property of Tresorit or the personal safety of our users and the public.
        
8.  **Fees**
    
    1.  **Service Plan:** Tresorit offers both free and paid Services. If Customer subscribes to a paid Service directly through the subscription flow of Tresorit, then prices and features of Services depend on the Service Plan selected as well as any changes instigated by Customer. Tresorit's current prices and features are published on Tresorit's website.
        
    2.  **Fees, currency:** Customer will pay Tresorit or the relevant Reseller all applicable fees ("Fees") for the Services, in the currency quoted at the time of purchase. Customer authorises Tresorit, to charge Customer for all applicable Fees using Customer's selected payment method. **Fees are non-refundable except as required by law or as otherwise specifically permitted in this Agreement.**
        
    3.  **Licenses:** Subject to any limitation on the number of individual user accounts available under the applicable Service Plan(s) to which Customer subscribed, access to and use of the Services is restricted to the specified number of individual Company Administered Users permitted under Customer's subscription.
        
    4.  **Subscription Period:** When subscribing to a paid service, Customer may elect the term of its Service Plan ("Subscription Period"). If Customer selects a monthly Service Plan, Customer can switch to an annual Service Plan at any time. If Customer selects an annual Service Plan, Customer may not change to a monthly Service Plan until the end of the one-year term of Customer's Service Plan.
        
    5.  **Billing:** Customer must provide current, complete, accurate and authorized payment method information (e.g. credit card information). Tresorit may bill: (i) in advance; (ii) at the time of purchase; (iii) shortly after purchase; or (iv) on a recurring basis.
        
    6.  **Auto-renewal:** Fees will automatically be charged monthly or annually, for each month, partial month or year, depending upon the billing period selected by Customer for the subscription. **Customer agrees that its subscription is automatically renewed for the same period at the end of each billing period** (but for no longer than a year), **and Tresorit may charge automatically at the end of the trial or the renewal, unless Customer notifies Tresorit in advance that Customer wants to cancel.**
        
    7.  **Downgrade and cancellation:** No refunds or credits for Fees or payments will be provided to Customer if Customer elects to downgrade or cancel its Service Plan. Please consider the relevant changes carefully as downgrading the Service Plan may cause loss of content, features, or capacity of the Service, and Tresorit does not accept any liability for such loss.
        
    8.  **Changes:** Tresorit uses reasonable commercial efforts to implement changes of the Service Plan or features instigated by Customer as soon as possible. If Customer decides to downgrade or cancel, changes will take effect the day after the last day of the then current Subscription Period.
        
    9.  **Joining the subscription of others:** If your account as a Customer is added to the subscription of another Tresorit customer, then all previous subscriptions under your account may be immediately cancelled and removed. As a Customer, you understand and acknowledge that if you join the subscription of another Tresorit Customer, you become dependent from this customer and take the risk that Tresorit may suspend the Service for reasons caused by this customer.
        
    10.  **Taxes:** Fees are exclusive of taxes and Customer is responsible for all taxes. Tresorit will invoice Customer for such taxes if Tresorit believes that it has a legal obligation to do so and Customer agrees to pay such taxes if so invoiced. If Customer is exempt from paying any taxes, Customer must provide Tresorit with a valid exemption certificate for all relevant jurisdictions, and Tresorit will not collect the taxes covered by the relevant certificate.
        
    11.  **Changes of fees:** In cases where Tresorit offered a specific duration and Fee for use of the Service, the Fee will remain in force for the relevant Subscription Period. However, Tresorit does not represent or warrant that a particular Service Plan will be offered indefinitely and reserves the right to change the prices for or alter the features and options in a particular Service Plan. Tresorit may revise the relevant Fees by providing Customers at least thirty days' notice. Subject to applicable law, Customer's use of the Service will be charged at the then-current Fee(s) after the relevant period ends, unless Customer cancels the subscription at the end of his current subscription period.
        
    12.  **Purchase from Reseller:** If you as a Customer purchase from a Reseller, then the scope of the Services and the specifics of your payment obligations are stated in your agreement with the Reseller. In such case, you owe payment to the Reseller as agreed between you and the Reseller, but you acknowledge that Customer's rights to use the Services may be suspended or terminated if Tresorit does not receive the corresponding payment from the Reseller.
        
9.  **Promotions and free services**
    
    1.  **Promotions:** Customer may receive or be eligible for certain pricing structures, discounts, features, promotions, and other benefits (collectively, "Promotions"). Any and all such Promotions may be modified or terminated without notice. It will be Tresorit's sole decision as to whether any eligibility requirement has or has not been met and Tresorit may require evidence or confirmation for such purpose. All Promotions are subject to availability, are non-transferable and non-exchangeable.
        
    2.  **Free Services:** If Customer registers for a free trial, promotional offer, or other type of limited offer for use of the Services ("Free Service"), Customer may need to accept additional terms and conditions upon registration. Any such additional terms and conditions are hereby incorporated into this Agreement by reference and are legally binding.
        
    3.  **Trial:** Customer can sign-up for a trial for some of the Services which may require payment preauthorization. The trial period starts on the day when Customer creates the trial subscription. During the trial, Customer may cancel at any time until the last day of the trial. If the trial period ends, the relevant subscription may automatically be converted to a paid subscription and the relating Fee will be automatically charged. For accounts used for business purposes, Tresorit reserves the right to reduce the term of a trial period or end it altogether without prior notice.
        
    4.  **Disclaimer:** Free Services are provided "AS IS" and "as available" without any warranty that may be set forth in this Agreement, and Tresorit DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND TRESORIT'S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO CUSTOMER'S USE OF THE FREE TRIAL IS EUR 100.
        
10.  **Software**
    
    1.  **Customer's rights:** Tresorit remains the owner of the Software at all times. Tresorit grants to you a limited non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Software in connection with the Services and in accordance with this Agreement. Tresorit and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Software even after installation on your devices.
        
    2.  **Software updates:** The Software may be updated automatically from time to time. In other cases, you may need to download and install the latest version of the Software. Any updates provided by Tresorit shall be deemed to be subject to this Agreement unless Tresorit indicates otherwise. Depending on the update, you may not be able to use the Services until you have downloaded the latest version of the Software and accepted any new terms. Users must keep their Tresorit clients up-to-date. If you skip updating for more than 6 months, Tresorit may suspend or terminate this Agreement and the relevant User's account with a fifteen-day notice.
        
    3.  **Open-Source:** You acknowledge that the Software may contain third-party, open-source software components ("Open-Source Component").

*   Payments and pricing
    --------------------
    
    27.  Tresorit offers You both free and paid Services. If you choose to subscribe to a paid Service directly through the subscription flow of Tresorit, your account must be bound with one or multiple plan(s) ("User Plan(s)") and you agree to pay the fees ("Fees") in accordance with the relevant User Plan(s).
    28.  These Terms apply whether you purchase our Service directly from Tresorit or through a Reseller of Tresorit. If you purchase through a Reseller, then the scope of the Services and the specifics of your payment obligations shall be stated in your agreement with the Reseller. In such case, You owe payment to the Reseller as agreed between you and the Reseller, but you acknowledge that we may suspend or terminate your rights to use the Services if we do not receive our corresponding payment from the Reseller. If you subscribe to the Service directly through the subscription flow of Tresorit, then the following provisions shall apply:
        1.  The subscription is the billing unit ("Subscription(s)"), which means if You have multiple Subscriptions, You will receive multiple invoices. Each Subscription has its own billing period, and can be monthly or yearly paid.
        2.  A Subscription is Your order, and can contain multiple User Plans in one Subscription. You can bind a User Plan to yourself, or to another user, for example to Your colleague, but only to one user. If You bind a User Plan to someone else, You are responsible for the usage of this User Plan by this person. If You accept a User Plan as beneficiary from another user, take note and accept that you are dependent from this person and take the risk that Tresorit may suspend the Service for reasons caused by this person.
        3.  Each User Plan has characteristics ("Feature Quota(s)") included in the User Plan. A Feature Quota can be for example the storage quota, the maximum network bandwidth speed You can use our Service, etc.
        4.  If You are bound to multiple User Plans, we aggregate each User Plan if possible the following way ("Aggregated Feature Quota"): the storage quota included in each User Plan are summed up, and we provide You the Feature Quota, which we think, in our sole discretion, is the most beneficiary for You among the Feature Quotas included in any User Plan bound to You.
        5.  If Your account is transformed to a Business account, all your previous Subscriptions and User Plans under this account, other than one Business subscription You are transforming to, may be immediately cancelled and removed. Other accounts associated with non-Business domains will remain independent from this transformation.
    29.  After You have successfully created a Subscription, and You have bound yourself or another user to User Plan(s), we use reasonable commercial efforts to credit Your new Feature Quota as soon as possible, but in six hours after Your purchase. You agree that Your displayed available storage or other quota may not be current or accurate at any time, but Tresorit uses reasonable efforts to improve the accuracy and actuality.
    30.  Tresorit may provide You the Service for free of charge, providing a basic Feature Quota. You may also gain additional free service through Tresorit's referral program or other promotion, as described in the promotions. Tresorit may also provide You a free trial period for a Business or other premium service Subscription, which may require preauthorization credit card charge. If the trial period ends, Tresorit may automatically convert your Subscription to a paying subscription and automatically charge You the Subscription fee, or Tresorit may decrease your Feature Quota to the basic free Feature Quota. You agree that if you started a trial for a Business subscription, Tresorit will not decrease your Feature Quota to the basic free Feature Quota if you decide not to continue with any paying Business Subscription and Tresorit will follow its normal procedure of Suspension and Termination. We reserve the right to, in our sole discretion, discontinue or modify any promotions, credits or other free offers anytime.
    31.  Payment of the Subscription fee will be by preauthorized credit card charge, and we will automatically charge Your credit card or other agreed payment options monthly or yearly, for each month, partial month or year, depending upon which billing period You have selected for the Subscription. You agree that Your Subscription is automatically renewed for the same period at the end of the billing period ("Renewal date") unless You state otherwise one (1) day before the Renewal date.
    32.  We will automatically bill Your credit card or other agreed payment options each month or each year on the calendar day when You created Your Subscription. If Your Subscription has started on a calendar day not contained in a given month or year, Tresorit will bill Your credit card on the last day of such month or year.
    33.  If any fee of a Subscription is not paid in a timely manner, or Tresorit was not able to charge Your credit card with the payable fees, Tresorit has the right to suspend Your entire Subscription and revoke each Feature Quota included any User Plan from You or any user You have bound to. This means, we will decrease Your Aggregated Feature Quota to the aggregation of Your remaining User Plans.
    34.  You agree and authorize Tresorit to periodically authorize Your credit card in anticipation of account or related charges.
    35.  You must be authorized to use the credit card of which number You have entered.
    36.  You understand that if You do not provide Tresorit with a current valid credit card number with sufficient credit upon request during the effective period of this Agreement, You will be in violation of these Terms.
    37.  Your Subscription may include a time commitment (Committed Period; e.g. one year commitment with monthly payment). If you cancel, terminate or rescind a Subscription or terminate the Agreement during the Committed Period, we are entitled to charge you for the remaining Committed Period according to Your Subscription.
    38.  Tresorit reserves the right to change prices of Your Subscription. If there is a specific length and price offered to You, or You have a Committed Period, price will remain the same for that time. Tresorit will provide at least 30 days advance notice to You about the change of the price.
    39.  All payments by You to Tresorit are final, nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used billing periods or partially used Committed Periods, except as stated herein (paragraph 57,84 and 85).
    40.  Unless specifically provided otherwise herein, payment of all fees are due and payable to Tresorit without demand, invoicing or notice before the commencement of the period to which those fees apply.
    41.  You agree to be responsible for and to pay any applicable sales, personal property, use, VAT, excise, withholding, or any other taxes that may be imposed, based on this license, use or possession of the Service, or any other product or service provided under these Terms, excluding taxes based on net income payable by Tresorit. If You are exempt from paying any sales, use or other taxes, You must provide Tresorit with appropriate evidence of tax exemption for all relevant jurisdictions.

*   Payments and pricing
    --------------------
    
    27.  Tresorit offers You upgrades. In order to upgrade, Your account must be bound with one or multiple plan(s) ("User Plan(s)").
        1.  You can create User Plan(s) by creating subscription(s), and adding User Plans to it.
        2.  The subscription is the billing unit ("Subscription(s)"), which means if You have multiple Subscriptions, You will receive multiple invoices. Each Subscription has its own billing period, and can be monthly or yearly paid.
        3.  A Subscription is Your order, and can contain multiple User Plans in one Subscription. You can bind a User Plan to yourself, or to another user, for example to Your colleague, but only to one user. If You bind a User Plan to someone else, You are responsible for the usage of this User Plan by this person. If You accept a User Plan as beneficiary from another user, take note and accept that you are dependent from this person and take the risk that Tresorit may suspend the Service for reasons caused by this person.
        4.  Each User Plan has characteristics ("Feature Quota(s)") included in the User Plan. A Feature Quota can be for example the storage quota, the maximum network bandwidth speed You can use our Service, etc.
        5.  If You are bound to multiple User Plans, we aggregate each User Plan if possible the following way ("Aggregated Feature Quota"): the storage quota included in each User Plan are summed up, and we provide You the Feature Quota, which we think, in our sole discretion, is the most beneficiary for You among the Feature Quotas included in any User Plan bound to You.
        6.  If Your account is transformed to a Business account, all your previous Subscriptions and User Plans under this account, other than one Business subscription You are transforming to, may be immediately cancelled and removed. Other accounts associated with non-Business domains will remain independent from this transformation.
    28.  After You have successfully created a Subscription, and You have bound yourself or another user to User Plan(s), we use reasonable commercial efforts to credit Your new Feature Quota as soon as possible, but in six hours after Your purchase. You agree that Your displayed available storage or other quota may not be current or accurate at any time, but Tresorit uses reasonable efforts to improve the accuracy and actuality.
    29.  Tresorit may provide You the Service for free of charge, providing a basic Feature Quota. You may also gain additional free service through Tresorit's referral program or other promotion, as described in the promotions. Tresorit may also provide You a free trial period for a Business or other premium service Subscription, which may require preauthorization credit card charge. If the trial period ends, Tresorit may automatically convert your Subscription to a paying subscription and automatically charge You the Subscription fee, or Tresorit may decrease your Feature Quota to the basic free Feature Quota. You agree that if you started a trial for a Business subscription, Tresorit will not decrease your Feature Quota to the basic free Feature Quota if you decide not to continue with any paying Business Subscription and Tresorit will follow its normal procedure of Suspension and Termination. We reserve the right to, in our sole discretion, discontinue or modify any promotions, credits or other free offers anytime.
    30.  Payment of the Subscription fee will be by preauthorized credit card charge, and we will automatically charge Your credit card or other agreed payment options monthly or yearly, for each month, partial month or year, depending upon which billing period You have selected for the Subscription. You agree that Your Subscription is automatically renewed for the same period at the end of the billing period ("Renewal date") unless You state otherwise one (1) day before the Renewal date.
    31.  We will automatically bill Your credit card or other agreed payment options each month or each year on the calendar day when You created Your Subscription. If Your Subscription has started on a calendar day not contained in a given month or year, Tresorit will bill Your credit card on the last day of such month or year.
    32.  If any fee of a Subscription is not paid in a timely manner, or Tresorit was not able to charge Your credit card with the payable fees, Tresorit has the right to suspend Your entire Subscription and revoke each Feature Quota included any User Plan from You or any user You have bound to. This means, we will decrease Your Aggregated Feature Quota to the aggregation of Your remaining User Plans.
    33.  You agree and authorize Tresorit to periodically authorize Your credit card in anticipation of account or related charges.
    34.  You must be authorized to use the credit card of which number You have entered.
    35.  You agree that if You do not provide Tresorit with a current valid credit card number with sufficient credit upon request during the effective period of this Agreement, You will be in violation of these Terms.
    36.  Your Subscription may include a time commitment (Committed Period; e.g. one year commitment with monthly payment). If you cancel, terminate or rescind a Subscription or terminate the Agreement during the Committed Period, we are entitled to charge you for the remaining Committed Period according to Your Subscription.
    37.  Tresorit reserves the right to change prices of Your Subscription. If there is a specific length and price offered to You, or You have a Committed Period, price will remain the same for that time. Tresorit will provide at least 30 days advance notice to You about the change of the price.
    38.  All payments by You to Tresorit are final, nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used billing periods or partially used Committed Periods, except as stated herein (paragraph 57,84 and 85).
    39.  Unless specifically provided otherwise herein, payment of all fees are due and payable to Tresorit without demand, invoicing or notice before the commencement of the period to which those fees apply.
    40.  You agree to be responsible for and to pay any applicable sales, personal property, use, VAT, excise, withholding, or any other taxes that may be imposed, based on this license, use or possession of the Service, or any other product or service provided under these Terms, excluding taxes based on net income payable by Tresorit.
