# Contrib versions

## Context

[Open Terms Archive](https://opentermsarchive.org) is free and open source software that publicly records every version of the terms of digital services, increasing their readability and highlighting their changes to enable democratic oversight. Check out [opentermsarchive.org for more details](https://opentermsarchive.org).

In the context of Open Terms Archive:
- a **version** is a record of a service's terms cleaned of the non-significant parts (menus, ads,...) of the online document.
Each version represents the state of the terms at the time of its capture, and they are publicly stored to provide a historical record of how the terms have evolved over time.
- a **collection** refers to a grouping of terms tracked by Open Terms Archive characterised through a three-dimensional scope defined by language, jurisdiction and industry.

Detailed information about this collection can be found at [its definition repository](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/contrib-declarations).

**This repository has to be considered as the database of versions for this collection.**
