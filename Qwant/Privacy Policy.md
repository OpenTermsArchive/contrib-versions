Privacy policy
==============

At Qwant, transparency, security, and the protection of your personal data have always been a top priority. This document aims to inform you about the types of data we collect, why we collect it, how we manage it, as well as your privacy rights and how you can exercise these rights.

This Privacy Policy applies to the website [www.qwant.com](http://www.qwant.com/) (the “Site”), accessible from your computer, tablet, and smartphone (“Device”) . This policy governs the processing of personal data of all “Users” accessing the Site. It also governs the processing related to the use of the search engine and its new features (the “Services”).

You may not be subject to all the processing mentioned below. Indeed, since the new features are not accessible to all Users, some processing is only carried out with your consent and/or upon the creation of your user account (See « [_Why Qwant processes your data and uses cookies_](#cookies) »)

Qwant, located at 42 Avenue de la Porte de Clichy, 75017 Paris, acts as the data controller within the meaning of Article 4.7 of the GDPR. You can contact the Data Protection Officer (“DPO”) via the following address: [legal@qwant.com](mailto:legal@qwant.com)

Why Qwant processes your data and uses cookies?
-----------------------------------------------

Qwant remains your search engine, preserving your privacy without targeted advertising or storing your search history, thus guaranteeing neutral and unfiltered results without using advertising cookies on your Device. Your data remains confidential, and the processing of your data remains the same.

Qwant also gives you the opportunity to test our new features integrating artificial intelligence once a month. Details on the processing of your data are available in the “[Non-Consent](#non-consent)” processing table.

Qwant offers its users several new ways to use its Services. You can create a user account to gain unlimited access to new features. In this case, certain data processing is necessary to ensure the proper functioning of these Services (including the transmission of the IP address). Information about this processing is provided in the “[Non-Consent](#non-consent)” processing table.

If you wish to receive personalized ads based on your interests or searches, you can consent to the use of analytical or personalization advertising cookies. Details on this processing and its purposes are available in the “[Consent](#consent)” processing table. If you do not wish to, simply refuse them during the consent collection and through our cookie manager.

How are your data used for advertising purposes?
------------------------------------------------

**Collection via Microsoft Advertising and Microsoft Clarity**

Only if you decide to create a User Account and consent through our cookie manager to Microsoft using cookies for advertising purposes, Microsoft will be able to exploit the advertising spaces on our Services. Microsoft will then auction these advertising spaces in real-time, allowing the highest bidders to access them.

By accepting this use, Microsoft can collect information from our Services about the advertising spaces sold through their intermediary as well as your Device and browsing data. This data could be combined with other information about you they possess to present you with personalized ads during your navigation on our services and on third-party services.

If you want to know more about how Microsoft Advertising uses your data, you can visit their privacy policy [here.](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement)

Furthermore, regarding Bing search queries, Microsoft anonymizes stored queries by deleting the entire IP address after 6 months and cookie identifiers and other intersession identifiers used to identify a specific account or device after 18 months.

Finally, if you refuse cookies from our cookie manager, Microsoft will only collect Device Data as indicated above. If you initially consented to the use of cookies for advertising purposes by Microsoft but later change your choice, any information collection about you by Microsoft will immediately cease.

**Our Advertising Partners**

We work with several advertising partners to offer our ads. Generally, these partners act as data controllers, meaning they define the purposes and methods of using your data, ensure its confidentiality, and guarantee compliance with laws and regulations.
