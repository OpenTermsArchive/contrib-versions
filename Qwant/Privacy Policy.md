Policy for the protection of your personal data
-----------------------------------------------

A search engine that respects your privacy
------------------------------------------

At Qwant, we don’t know who you are. No targeting, no retention of your search history: your age, gender and interests belong only to you. With each request, you start from a blank page.

An open and neutral web at your service
---------------------------------------

By not tracking our users, our search engine offers you a panoramic view of the web and guarantees neutral results, without filter bubbles. It does not lock you into your certainties. Your previous searches will not influence the next ones!

Browse without targeted advertising!
------------------------------------

Qwant does not place any advertising cookies on your browser. In this way, the advertising that will appear in your navigation will be linked to your search keywords, and not to your user profile.

Your data is not a currency
---------------------------

It is common to hear today that data is the new “black gold”. Not at Qwant. We do not sell your data to third parties, for advertising or any other use.

A made-in-France alternative that applies European legislation
--------------------------------------------------------------

Anxious to respect the French and European legislative framework, Qwant rigorously applies the GDPR. We respect fundamental rights, including the right to be forgotten which offers you the possibility to obtain the erasure of your data.

How does Qwant protect your privacy?
------------------------------------

When you use Qwant as a search engine, we do not place **any advertising cookies** on your browser  and we do not look at what you have personally searched for previously. During a request, it is immediately pseudonymized using the methods set out in this Privacy Policy.

We also undertake to make every effort to guarantee the security and confidentiality of our users’ personal data and in particular to prevent this data from being altered, erased or accessed by unauthorized third parties. The URL of Qwant includes the mention HTTPS which signals to users that they communicate their data securely through the TLS protocol. Technically, TLS assures visitors that their data cannot be intercepted when it travels over the network fraudulently or accidentally. In addition, the padlock in front of the Qwant URL on most browsers certifies that you are browsing a secure site.

If you change your browsing settings (language, activation or deactivation of options), a cookie may be installed on your browser, exclusively for the purpose of storing these settings. You have the option to delete cookies from your browser. For more information, please see our [cookie policy](https://about.qwant.com/en/legal/confidentialite/cookie-policy/).

However, the provision of a search engine by nature requires certain data processing. The purpose of the following section of this Privacy Policy is therefore to explain in detail the cases in which we need to process information about you, the reasons why we collect certain data, the methods we use to pseudonymize the data, the use we make of it, and the identity of our partners when data is transferred to them. It also reminds you of your rights and how to exercise them with Qwant.

What data about you is collected?
---------------------------------

The information collected by Qwant includes:

* **Identity** information – this is the information we use to ensure that you are who you say you are when you make a de-listing request, report or create an account. This includes: first name, last name, email address.

* **Device Information** – this is the information we use to secure our network and improve our services and performance. This includes, for example: hash of the IP address (with a salt changing every three months at the latest, User Agent, market segment of a request, date and time of the visit, information of the country and the chosen language.

* **Statistical** information – this is pseudonymized information that we use to improve the performance of our web search service and to understand the use that is made of this service. This includes, for example: search keywords, where a user came from, search box used to trigger a query, type of device used, source of visit, operating system, major browser version.

In order to preserve the non-identifiable nature of the data, Qwant ensures to implement a conservation that does not allow cross-checking that could make a data identifiable.

**Processing user requests and displaying ads**

Qwant keeps for 1 month (from the 1st of the month) the keyword(s) entered associated with a pseudonymous identifier calculated from the User Agent of your browser and the hash salted with your IP address. After this period, keywords are no longer associated with an identifier and kept for 12 months for the purpose of aggregated statistical analysis (e.g. how many times a keyword is searched for over a given period).

This processing is necessary for the execution of Qwant’s General Terms and Conditions of Use, on the basis of Article 6.1.b of the GDPR (processing necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us), and meets Qwant’s legitimate interest (Article 6.1.f of the GDPR) to secure and make its services reliable.

In order to provide you with relevant results from around the world when we do not have the answers to your queries ourselves, we partner with Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited to provide a portion of our search results and provide contextual advertising based on the keywords entered and your geographic region.

For this purpose, Qwant may transfer to this partner the following pseudonymous data related to your request:

* Search keywords;
* Information about the browser you are using (the User Agent);
* The first three bytes of your IP address;
* The approximate geographic area at the origin of the search, at the scale of a region or city;
* The salty hash generated from your IP address, your User Agent and a salt changing no later than every 3 months;
* A random token generated by Qwant (aiming to limit data cross-checking).

This processing is necessary for the execution of Qwant’s General Terms and Conditions of Use, on the basis of Article 6.1.b of the GDPR (processing necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us).

In addition, for security purposes and reliability of our partner’s services (detection of spam, automated activity, fraudulent clicks on advertisements …), Qwant may also collect and transfer to this partner your full IP address.

This processing is in the legitimate interest of Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited (Article 6.1.f) to secure and make its services more reliable.

This data is transmitted to this partner within the European Union, and may be retained in accordance with Bing’s [Privacy Policy](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement) for a maximum period of 18 months.

**Measuring the effectiveness of certain contextual advertising results**

In order to establish an aggregated measure of the effectiveness of advertisements provided by our partner Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited and to strengthen its means of detecting fraudulent clicks, Qwant may also transfer the following data for certain categories of ads if you click on an advertisement from the Microsoft network and return to the same Qwant results page:

* The measurement of the time elapsed between your click on the ad and your eventual return to the results page.

This data shared with Microsoft is used exclusively for the purposes indicated above and may not be used for any other purpose. It cannot be used for advertising based on a user profile on Qwant or third-party services.

This data is transmitted to this partner within the European Union, and may be retained in accordance with Bing’s [Privacy Policy](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement) for a maximum period of 18 months.

This processing is necessary for the execution of Qwant’s General Terms and Conditions of Use, on the basis of Article 6.1.b of the GDPR (processing necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us).

**Statistics and audience measurement**

To evaluate its audience and understand the use of its services in order to improve them, Qwant also keeps other data relating to your use of the services (associated for 30 days with an anonymous identifier common to all users In addition, the Qwant provider keeps an anonymous randomly generated visitor ID for 13 months from the first visit.

Likewise, we occasionally run so-called “A/B” tests. These tests enable us to compare different versions of our engine or features to see which works best. The aim is to understand user preferences and improve the usability and efficiency of our search engine.

In this context, we only use aggregated and anonymized data, such as the number of clicks on a feature or the time spent on a page, to evaluate the performance of the different versions tested.

If you do not wish to take part in these tests, you can opt out via our [cookie manager](https://www.qwant.com/?drawer=cookies-management). For these tests, Qwant’s supplier retains a randomly generated anonymous identifier that is kept for 6 months from the first visit.

This processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Qwant to draw up statistics and measure its audience, on the basis of Article 6.1.f of the RGPD. These processing operations, which do not contain personal data, are governed by Article 82 of the French Data Protection Act (Loi Informatique et Libertés) concerning the exemption of consent in the context of the deposit of cookies for statistical purposes.

What data is processed for video playback?
------------------------------------------

However, the videos are called remotely by your browser from the server of their host which is likely to collect some of your personal data. Playback of videos from YouTube API Services is then subject [to YouTube’s Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/static?template=terms) and [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). Videos from the Dailymotion API are subject to the  [Dailymotion Terms of Service](https://www.dailymotion.com/legal) and the [Dailymotion Privacy Policy](https://www.dailymotion.com/legal/privacy?localization=fr).

FAQ - Privacy Policy
--------------------

_If you are wondering about the protection of privacy by Qwant, you will find below a frequently asked questions (FAQ) that presents a summary of Qwant’s Privacy Policy, but is not intended to replace it. For complete information, please refer to the full text of the Privacy Policy accessible at the bottom of the page._

Why is Qwant so keen to respect my privacy?
-------------------------------------------

Qwant knows that the search you do daily can reveal many things about you and your intimacy (your habits, your interests, your state of health, your religious or philosophical convictions, your political opinions, your sexual preferences, your diets, your purchasing power, your cultural knowledge…). You reveal a lot of things through your research that you do not reveal to your loved ones or on social networks. However, you must feel free to seek all the information you want without feeling observed, and without giving anyone the opportunity to exploit this knowledge of your private life.

On the other hand, we believe that it is not healthy to change the answers based on who is asking a question unless you explicitly ask for it. On Qwant, all users who do the same search have access to the same results.

This is why Qwant has chosen not to collect personal data for the purposes of personalizing advertising or creating an advertising profile, and not to analyze your search histories.

So Qwant does not display target advertising?
---------------------------------------------

Indeed. Qwant displays contextual advertising that depends exclusively on the keywords that are entered at the time the ad is displayed, and not on the person who performs the search. We do not display targeted advertising and do not incorporate cookies or other advertising tracking technologies.

Do you use advertising cookies?
-------------------------------

No.We use a cookie only to (i) carry out audience measurements and collect usage statistics in an aggregated manner and (ii) memorize your technical preferences for using Qwant, so that you keep them from one search to another on the same device. These cookies do not contain any advertising identifier and are not accessible by third parties with the exception of the provider of the audience measurement tool only on behalf of Qwant. In addition, we do not integrate any cookies or other tracking technologies provided by advertising agencies (see [our cookie policy](https://about.qwant.com/en/legal/confidentialite/cookie-policy/) for more details).

Why do you transfer data to Microsoft, and which ones?
------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft provides some of the search results you see in our pages, and provides ads related to the keywords in your query. We must therefore send Microsoft certain information related to your search that allows our partner to send us results and advertisements relevant to that search, and to combat fraudulent clicks or other activities that are not permitted by our usage rules.

To detect fraud, Qwant uses a specialized service offered by Microsoft, which does not have access to the keywords of your search. Only your IP address and the User Agent of your browser are communicated to this specialized service, to calculate a fraud probability score. The search keywords are sent separately to another service that does not know your IP address.

What can I do to better protect my privacy?
-------------------------------------------

Qwant does its utmost to preserve your privacy during your searches, but you can take additional measures to protect your browsing. For example, you can use a service such as a virtual private network (VPN) or the TOR relay service so that even Qwant does not have access to your real IP address.

We also advise you to use the Qwant application for your browsing or another browser that does not keep your browsing history and does not analyze it for advertising purposes.
