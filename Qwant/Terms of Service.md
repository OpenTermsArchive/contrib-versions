Terms of service
----------------

Welcome on QWANT!

The purpose of the present Terms and Conditions (hereafter ‘Terms’) is to define the terms and conditions under which you can use our products and services.

QWANT’s main activity is to provide a free-to-use, dynamic, updated search engine accessible through its website [https://www.qwant.com](https://www.qwant.com/) and to some accessory sub-domains such as [https://lite.qwant.com](https://lite.qwant.com/), or through its mobile application (hereafter ‘Services’).

You recognize that you have the necessary competence and means to access these Services and to use them. The use of our Services imply your approval of the present terms. We reserve the right to modify the terms at any time so they can fit the evolutions of the services of QWANT and/or their operation. You will be informed, by email and/or by any other appropriate means on the affected Services, of all substantial changes to the Terms, prior to their entry into force.

Note: the present document is a good faith translation of the official and enforceable terms which are written in French. The French version will prevail in case the two versions differ.

Accessibility of Services
-------------------------

You are informed that the Services are operational 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, and you recognize that this accessibility may however be interrupted in case of _force majeure_ or technical difficulties. We shall not be held responsible for network or servers dysfunctions of any other event that is out of our control, which would impede or degrade access to our Services. We reserve the right to interrupt, suspend momentarily or modify without prior notice access to all or parts of the Services, in order to maintain or control them, or to do tests. Such interruption, suspension or modification can not be entitled to obligations or compensations. We will do our best to inform you beforehand. You agree not to use the Services in an inappropriate way (for instance, by unlawfully accessing the Services, servers, computers or databases attached to the Services, by launching saturating attacks or by planting malicious or harmful material…), under penalty of prosecution. We reserve the right to deny access to the Services to any user who does not respect the present Terms.

Software and APIs
-----------------

It is the same with decompilation or source code extraction rights, except in cases where decompilation is authorized by law and within the boundaries of such law.

Unless explicitly agreed otherwise, no licence to use the QWANT Application Programming Interfaces (API) is granted to the User for any use other than within the framework of the Services published by QWANT.
