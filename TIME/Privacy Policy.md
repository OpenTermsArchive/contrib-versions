Statistics on California Consumer Requests We Receive

Meredith Corporation is comprised of a family of 7 distinct businesses for purposes of the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”): National Media Group, Local Media Group, Synapse, Bizrate, Cozi, MyLife, and MNI. Each business has its own business model and practices regarding personal information.

The CCPA requires Meredith to provide metrics on the number of requests from California residents that our consumer-facing businesses have received during the prior calendar year.

Below are statistics on the number of California requests each Meredith business has received and how they have been fulfilled. Please note that reporting requirements are not applicable to Local Media Group, Cozi, and MyLife because they do not meet the threshold for reporting under the CCPA. Reporting for MNI is also not required because MNI is a B2B business that does not receive consumer rights requests.

Additional Privacy Information

*   **Security, Retention, and Storage of Information**. We use commercially reasonable procedures to protect the personal information we collect. However, we cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the personal information you supply won’t be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.
*   **Children’s Privacy**. We do not knowingly allow anyone under the age of 16 to provide us with any personal information online. Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any personal information about themselves (such as their names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else. If you’re under 16, please do not register for the Site or provide us with any personal information (such as your name, e-mail address or phone number).
*   **Location of Your Personal Information**. Meredith is a U.S. company, and your personal information will be transferred to, processed, stored, and accessed by us, the Meredith Companies, and service providers in the United States and in other jurisdictions where we or they operate, which may not provide you with the same level of privacy protection as you are entitled to in your jurisdiction. When you visit our Site or use our brands, you consent to the processing of your information in the United States and other jurisdictions as described here.
*   **EU-U.S. Privacy Shield**.  Meredith adheres to the principles of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (“Privacy Shield Principles”) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union (“EU”) to the United States. However, we do not rely on the Privacy Shield Principles when we transfer or receive personal information transferred from the EU. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Statement and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles will govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, please visit the [Privacy Shield website](https://www.privacyshield.gov/).

Meredith is responsible for the processing of personal information it receives under the Privacy Shield Principles or subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Meredith complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers from the EU and European Economic Area (“EEA”), including onward transfer liability provisions.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Meredith’s compliance with its obligations under the Privacy Shield Principles. In certain situations, Meredith may be required to disclose personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Meredith commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. EU individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact us at [privacy@meredith.com](mailto:privacy@meredith.com).

Meredith has further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to JAMS, an established alternative dispute-resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not resolved your complaint, please contact or visit [JAMS](https://www.jamsadr.com/) or call 800-352-5267 to file a complaint. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing, and/or other fees and you cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Meredith will pay them for you.
