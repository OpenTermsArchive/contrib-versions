### **What are Our Third-Party Data Collection and Online Advertising Practices?**

#### **General**

We participate in interest-based advertising and use third-party marketing/advertising companies to serve you targeted advertisements based on your interests and to measure the effectiveness of those ads. 

We permit third-party online advertising networks or exchanges (or other entities, such as demand-side or sell-side platforms or ad servers), measurement/attribution companies, ad fraud verification companies, social media companies, and other third-party services to collect information about your use of our Services so that they may display ads on our Services, including interactions with ads, on other websites or services you may use, and on other devices you may use. 

#### **How We Collect This Information**

Typically, though not always, the information used for interest-based advertising is collected through tracking technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, and similar technologies, which recognize the device you are using and collect information, including clickstream information, browser type, time and date you visited the Sites, mobile ad ID or other digital identifier (e.g., iOS IDFA, Google AAID, cookie ID, click ID, other proprietary IDs such as open source “universal IDs” or other ID solutions) precise or coarse geolocation, and other information.

We may share a common account identifier (such as a hashed or encrypted email address or user ID) with our third-party advertising partners to help identify you across devices.

#### **Why We Collect This Information**

We and our third-party partners use this information to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests, to optimize marketing and advertising campaigns more broadly, as well as to provide marketing/advertising-related services such as reporting, analytics, market research, and measurement/attribution.

We may also use services provided by third parties (such as Nielsen, Google, and social media platforms) to serve targeted ads to you and others on such platforms. 

For example, we may do this by providing your email address (typically in hashed or encrypted format) or other information (such as phone number, which also is typically provided in hashed or encrypted format) to the platform provider, such as via API, direct file upload, server-to-server transfer, or integrating the tracking technologies of those platform providers (e.g., pixel). 

#### **How To Exercise Your Choices Regarding Online Ads**

Please see the “**What Controls Do I Have Over My Information?**” section below to learn how you can opt out of interest-based advertising.

#### **More On Social Media Platforms and Advertising**

Our Services may include social media features, such as the Facebook “Like” button, Pinterest, Instagram, Twitter, or other widgets. These social media companies may recognize you and collect information about your visit to our Services, and they may set a cookie or employ other tracking technologies. Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of those companies.

We display targeted advertising to you through social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and other social media forums.  For example, these companies have interest-based advertising programs that allow us to direct advertisements to users who have shown interest in our services while those users are on the social media platform, or to groups of other users who share similar traits, such as likely commercial interests and demographics.  As mentioned in the section above, we may share a unique identifier, such as a user ID or hashed or encrypted email address or phone number, with these platform providers or they may collect information from our website visitors through a pixel (or other mechanism, such as API, direct file upload, or server-to-server integration), in order to direct targeted advertising to you or to a custom audience (including “look-a-like” audiences, such as audiences that are similar to you or other users) on the social media platform.  These advertisements are governed by the privacy policies of those social media companies that provide them.  If you do not want to receive targeted ads on your social networks, you may be able to adjust your advertising preferences through your settings on those networks.

#### **Your California Consumer Rights**

As a California resident, you may be able to exercise the following rights in relation to the PI about you that we have collected (subject to certain limitations under the CCPA, such as exceptions therein and the ability to verify your identity):

**The Right to Access**

You have the right to request any or all the PI we have collected and disclosed in the last 12 months. Note that your right to receive PI is limited to twice in a 12-month period.

**The Right to Request Deletion**

You have the right to request the deletion of PI we have collected from you, subject to certain exceptions.

**The Right to Opt-Out of Sales**

You have the right to direct us not to “sell” PI we have collected about you to third parties now or in the future (as such term “sale” is broadly defined under the CCPA, which includes disclosures to third parties for both monetary and non-monetary consideration).

We do not have actual knowledge of “selling” PI of consumers under sixteen (16) years of age.

**The Right to Non-Discrimination**

You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment for exercising these rights. However, please note that if the exercise of these rights limits our ability to process PI (such as in the case of a deletion request), we may no longer be able to provide you our products and services or engage with you in the same manner.

**“Shine the Light”**

California residents that have an established business relationship with us have rights to know how their information is disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes under California’s “Shine the Light” law (_Civ. Code §1798.83_).

#### **To Exercise Your Right to Access or Right to Deletion**

To exercise your right to access or deletion, please submit a request by filling out our California Consumer Rights Request Form.

Before processing your request, we will need to verify your identity and confirm you are a resident of the State of California. In order to verify your identity, we will generally either require the successful authentication of your account or the matching of sufficient information you provide us to the information we maintain about you in our systems. This process may require us to request additional personal information from you, including, but not limited to, your email address, phone number, or date of last transaction on our Services.

In certain circumstances, we may decline a request to exercise the rights described above, particularly where we are unable to verify your identity or locate your information in our systems. If we cannot comply with a request, we will explain the reasons in our response. 

#### **To Exercise Your Right to Opt-Out of “Sales”**

We “sell” PI to third parties, as such term is broadly defined under the CCPA.  The third parties to whom we “sell” PI may use such information for their own purposes in accordance with their own privacy statements, which may include reselling this information to additional third parties.

To exercise your right to opt-out of “sales,” you may submit a request by clicking the following link:  [Do Not Sell My Personal Information](https://privacyportalde-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/2159c482-749a-49db-916b-475017a9efa5/424d0d20-a84d-41ed-9a27-379d31f2551d.html)

#### **Authorized Agents**

In certain circumstances, you are permitted to use an authorized agent (as that term is defined by the CCPA) to submit requests on your behalf through the designated methods set forth in this CA Notice where we can verify the authorized agent’s authority to act on your behalf. 

For requests to access or delete PI, we require the following for verification purposes: 

(a) a power of attorney valid under the laws of California from you or your authorized agent; or 

(b) sufficient evidence to show that you have:

1. provided the authorized agent signed permission to act on your behalf; and  
      
    
2. verified your own identity directly with us pursuant to the instructions set forth in this CA Notice; or directly confirmed with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request on your behalf.

For requests to opt-out of “sales,” we require a signed permission demonstrating your authorized agent has been authorized by you to act on your behalf.

#### **California’s “Shine the Light” Law**

If you have an established business relationship with us, you may have rights to know how your information is disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes under California’s “Shine the Light” law (_Civ. Code § 1798.83_). To make such a request, please send an email to privacy@dotdashmdp.com.

#### **Notice of Financial Incentives**

We may offer you financial incentives for the collection, sale, retention, and use of your PI as permitted by the CCPA that can, without limitation, result in reasonably different prices, rates, or quality levels. The material aspects of any financial incentive will be explained and described in its program terms. Please note that participating in incentive programs is entirely optional, you will have to affirmatively opt-in to the program and you can opt-out of each program (i.e., terminate participation and forgo the ongoing incentives) prospectively by following the instructions in the applicable program description and terms. We may add or change incentive programs, and/or their terms by posting notice on the program descriptions and terms linked to above, so check them regularly.

Each financial incentive or price or service difference related to the collection and use of personal information is based upon our reasonable, good-faith determination of the estimated value of such information to our business, taking into consideration the value of the offer itself and the anticipated revenue generation that may be realized by rewarding brand loyalty. We calculate the value of the offer and financial incentive by using the expense related to the offer.
