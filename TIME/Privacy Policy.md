Thank you for visiting this Time Inc . website, or using our mobile device applications (the "Apps") or other services (together with the Apps, the "Services"). We have prepared this Privacy Policy to explain the manner in which Time Inc . (at the address in the section **"Data Controller"** below) and its affiliates Time Customer Service, Inc., Time Warner Publishing B.V. and Time Magazines Europe Limited (each, a controller of your personal data) (collectively, "Time Inc."), and the Branch Office of the Dutch parent Time Warner Publishing B.V. (Johannesburg, South Africa) and Time Asia (Hong Kong) Ltd. and their service providers (each, a processor of your personal data) collect, use, disclose and otherwise treat the personal data of consumers based in the European Union, Switzerland, Norway, Lichtenstein, Iceland, Australia, and New Zealand.

Advertisements displayed to you when you use our Services and elsewhere may be customized and targeted to your interests and preferences based on your personal data collected through our Services. For more information on advertising and your rights and choices, see **"Third Party Websites, Social Media, and Advertisers"** and **"Your Opt-Out Choices"** below.

   
**Collection of Personal Data**

We collect personal data, which is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, when you:

*   subscribe to one of our publications;
*   download and register to use one of our Apps or other Services;
*   purchase, return, or exchange products offered through one of our websites or publications;
*   subscribe to one of our online newsletters, or register to participate in an online forum or community;
*   submit content to one of our publications or Services;
*   enter into a contest or sweepstakes;
*   apply for a job;
*   respond to one of our polls or surveys; or
*   contact our customer service department with an enquiry, comment or suggestion.

Some of the personal data we request from you is required in order for you to use our Services. If you do not wish to provide such personal data to us, you are not obligated to, but as a result you may not be able to use the particular Service. However, some of the personal data we request from you is optional. This means that you can elect not to provide it to us and you will still be able to use the Service. If not all the personal information we request on a form is required, we may identify the required personal data to you such as by displaying an asterisk (\*) next to the field where we request the required personal data.

Below are more detailed examples of where and how we collect personal data from you. Unless specifically stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, the data we collect may be used for any purpose set forth in **"How we Use the Information We Collect"** below.

_Subscriptions:_ When you subscribe to one of our publications, we ask you to provide your name, mailing address, e-mail address, and credit card or other payment information for the purposes of fulfilling your subscription, sending you invoices, contacting you about the expiry of your subscription, and sending you service messages about your subscription. Once you are subscribed, we may store your subscription information, including its start date, renewal date, pricing, publication, and any customer service contacts you may have with us.

_Apps:_ When you download and register to use one of our Apps, we collect from you information such as your name, mailing address, account number, postal code, and e-mail address. We use this information for purposes such as to look up your account in our records in order to populate your App with the content that comes with your subscription. We also assign a unique user ID to your App on your device so that we can identify you when you use the App and so that we can collect user metrics such as how you use the App. Unless you opt out on your device, we will send messages to your device when a new issue of our publication is available through our App.

_Product Purchases:_ When you purchase products offered through one of our websites or publications, we collect your credit card and other payment information and keep a history of your purchases. We use this information for purposes such as to process your orders, to better assist you when you visit or contact us in the future, as well as to improve our product offerings when we send you information about these in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

When you return merchandise purchased via one of our websites or request a refund or exchange, you may be asked to provide certain information, including your name, e-mail address, residential address and phone number. We collect and use this information for fraud prevention purposes, among other things.

_Online Registration:_ You do not have to register to browse some areas of our websites. However, registration may be required to receive online newsletters or to participate in certain website features, such as a community forum. When you register, you will be asked for personal data such as your name, e-mail address, and a user name and password that you select. We collect this information to identify who you are, to provide you with the service or information you requested, and/or to facilitate your participation in an on-line forum or community. We may also use this information for other purposes, such as promotional and marketing purposes, in accordance with this Privacy Policy and not in violation of applicable law.

Please remember that any information you disclose in these public forum or community areas becomes public information and is immediately accessible to other users, so it is important for you to carefully consider what, if any, personal data you reveal in these areas. We may use information disclosed by you in this way to promote our products and services in our advertising communications, among other things.

_Information about Other People:_ At some of our websites and through certain promotions, you can submit personal data about other people. For example, if you order a gift subscription and want it sent directly to the recipient, you would be required to submit the recipient's name and address. We do not use the recipient's personal data for any other purpose unless this is consistent with any further dealings which we may have with the recipient directly. We will also notify the recipient of this Privacy Policy.

_Promotions or Surveys:_ When you enter a contest or sweepstakes ("promotion") or participate in a survey or poll ("survey") we may ask you to provide your name, address, phone number and e-mail address. We use the information we collect on promotion entry forms to administer your participation in the promotions and for other purposes stated on the entry form. Our surveys ask for opinions on various issues and may be sponsored by our advertisers and partners. Information obtained through surveys is aggregated and used internally. We also share survey information with advertisers and marketing partners in an aggregated form that does not personally identify you. In the event personal information is requested as part of a survey, such personal information will only be provided to unaffiliated third parties after ensuring that depending on the circumstances you have either consented or not objected.

_Optional Information:_ Occasionally, we may request demographic information (like your age or gender) or information about your interests and purchasing preferences. In most instances, you do not have to provide us with this information to receive the publication, product, or service you have requested. When demographic information is required, it will be indicated, such as by an asterisk (\*). We use this demographic and preference information to, among other things, tailor or improve our publications, product and service offerings, including our offerings to you where this is in accordance with this Privacy Policy, as well as for internal marketing research purposes.

_Customer Service:_ When you call one of our customer service representatives, or e-mail us with a comment or question, you may be asked for information that identifies you, such as your name, mailing address, account number, postal code and telephone number, to help us promptly answer your question. We retain this information as necessary to assist you in the future, for instance with any further queries you may have. We also use your feedback, suggestions and comments to monitor and/or improve our publications, product offerings, and Services, among other things.

_Website Information:_ We collect the IP (Internet protocol) addresses of all visitors to our websites and clickstream and other related information, such as information about your computer or device, web browser and operating system and their settings, the referring page that linked you to our site, the pages, content or ads you see or click on during your visit and when and for how long you do so, items you download, the next Web site you visit when you leave our site, and any search terms you have entered on our site. We use this information to monitor and improve our Services, among other things.

_App Usage:_ We collect information about your installation, use, and updating of our Apps, such as information about your device, your use of our App, the pages, videos, other content or ads you see or click on during your visit and when and for how long you do so, and items you download. We use this information to enable the App to function correctly on your device and to provide you with the appropriate content through the App, among other things. We collect your device’s geographical location for the purpose of presenting you with relevant content, provided that you have given your prior affirmative express consent via your mobile device.

  
**Cookies and Web Beacons**

_Cookies:_ To enhance your experience on our Services, we place "cookies" on your computer or device. Cookies are small text files that we place in your computer or device to store your preferences. Other information you provide to us may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. A cookie assigns a unique numerical identifier to your Web browser or device, and may enable us to recognize you as the same user who has used our Services, and relate your use of the Services to other information about you. To learn more about how we use cookies on Services based in the EU, please visit the Cookie Policy linked to the EU-based Service you are using.

We use cookies (and Local Shared Objects, HTML5, cache cookies, web beacons, or clear gifs, all described further below) to understand usage of the Services and to improve our content and offerings and to deliver advertisements that you might be interested in. For example, we use cookies to personalise your experience on our Services (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to our site, to save your password in password-protected areas, to enable shopping carts, or to tailor content or product and service offerings).

Most browsers automatically accept cookies. You can set your browser option so that you will not receive cookies and you can also delete existing cookies from your browser. However, you may find that some parts of the site will not function properly if you have refused cookies or similar tracking technologies and you should be aware that disabling cookies or similar tracking technologies might prevent you from accessing some of our content. However, your viewing of editorial content may be hampered. If you wish to block cookies, go to [http://www.allaboutcookies.org/](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) to find out how, or check your browser’s instructions.

_Local Shared Objects:_ Local shared objects, such as Flash cookies, also may be stored on your computer or device. Local shared objects operate a lot like cookies, but cannot be managed in the same way. Depending on how local shared objects are enabled on your computer or device, you may be able to manage them using software settings. For information on managing Flash cookies, for example, see [http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html](http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html) .

_HTML 5:_ HTML5, the language some Web sites are coded in, may be used to store information on your computer or device about your Service usage activities. This information may be retrieved by us to help us manage our Services, such as by giving us information about how our Services are being used by our visitors, how they can be improved, and to customize them for our users.

_Cache Cookies:_ Cache cookies, such as eTags, may be used to identify your computer or device as the same computer or device that visited a Service or Services in the past.

_Web Beacons:_ Our websites may also use small pieces of code called "web beacons" or "clear gifs" to collect advertising metrics, such as counting page views, promotion views, or advertising responses. A web beacon is an electronic image called a single-pixel or clear GIF. Web beacons can recognise certain types of information, such as a user's cookie number, time and date of a page view, and description of the page where the web beacon is placed. These web beacons may be used to deliver cookies that conform to our cookie policy above.

_Mobile Device IDs and Location-Based Information:_ Certain mobile devices, including smart phones and tablet devices, contain unique device IDs that can be used to identify their physical location. Some mobile device IDs are persistent, while others may be resettable by accessing the device’s privacy settings. Mobile devices also typically transmit caller ID data (which may include a phone number) when used to transmit a telephone call or text message. When you use mobile devices to access our Services, we may collect and transmit unique device IDs and collect caller ID data, as well as other information about your device, including without limitation, your wireless carrier, the make, model, operating system, capacity and settings of your device, the names, package IDs and versions of other software you have downloaded to your device and information about how you interact with and navigate within our Service. With your consent, we or our authorized service providers and partners also may use precise geolocation technology such as GPS or Wi-Fi triangulation or mobile Bluetooth beacon technology to collect information about the exact location of your mobile device. Precise location information may be collected both while you are using one of our mobile applications and continuously over time while our apps are not in use but are running in the background of your device. You can withdraw your consent to the further collection and use of your precise device location data through any of our mobile apps by accessing your device’s privacy settings as further explained below in **"Opt-out Choices: Precise Device Location Tracking."** For information about how to reset your advertising identifier and your other opt-out choices relating to interest-based advertising in mobile applications, see **"Opt-out Choices: Mobile App Advertising and Tracking."**

These tracking technologies may be deployed by us and/or by our service providers or partners on our behalf.

  
**Personal Data We Obtain From Other Sources:**

We combine personal data collected through the Services with other information that we obtain about you, your computer, and/or device from other companies and sources. To the extent we combine personal data collected through the Services with information we obtain from third party sources, we will treat the combined data in accordance with the practices described in this Privacy Policy, plus any additional restrictions imposed by the source of the data. These third party sources vary over time, but have included:

*   Third party data suppliers from which we purchase demographic data to supplement the data we collect;
*   Social networks when you reference our Services or grant permission to Time Inc. to access your data on one or more of these services;
*   Partners with which we offer co-branded services, sell or distribute our products, or engage in joint marketing activities; and
*   Publicly-available sources such as open government databases or other data in the public domain.

The following are examples of information we have collected from other sources:

*   Name, postal address, email address and telephone number;
*   Demographic data, such as age, gender, and income level;
*   Your interests and purchase behavior;
*   Publicly-visible data, such as your posts and submissions to blogs, video-sharing services, and other interactive forums; and
*   Other navigation data, such as web sites visited and advertisements viewed or clicked on.

   
**How We Use The Personal Data We Collect:**

Our primary goal in collecting information is to provide you with a customized experience when using our Services and to make them more valuable to you. We and our authorized service providers use personal data that we or they collect about you for our legitimate interests, including to:

*   Analyze, operate and improve our Services, and fulfill your requests for products, services, and information, including to send you email and electronic newsletters;
*   Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, information regarding changes to our policies, and support and administrative messages;

*   Attribute content that you post to forums we operate on our Services;

*   Analyze how subscribers interact with our email messages and click on links contained within those messages;
*   Provide you with special offers, promotions and information from companies within our corporate family; and
*   Display, develop, and deliver direct marketing.

Because our Services are supported by advertising, we also use the information we collect to help us and advertisers efficiently reach consumers who are most likely to be interested in particular products and services. In addition, we use this information based on the consent you provide, such as if you visit our websites and consent to us processing your personal data to serve you with personalized ads. Your personal data is used with your consent, including to:

*   Recognize the same users as they access online or mobile services using multiple browsers or devices and deliver to them appropriate interest-based content and advertising;
*   Provide you with special offers, promotions and information from select third parties in accordance with applicable law;
*   Tailor advertising to your interests, including advertising that you see on our Services, advertising you see on third-party websites, mobile applications and email programs, and offers and advertising you may receive offline or as push-notifications, from us or others; and
*   Fulfill any other purposes disclosed to you at the time we collect your information and pursuant to your consent.

You always have the choice (now and in the future) to avoid personalized advertising based on your web browsing activity by visiting the DAA's Consumer Choice page, the NAI's website, and/or the EU online choices page, from each of your browsers or devices. For more information, see **"Your-Opt Out Choices"** below.

   
**Disclosure of Personal Data**

We will not disclose, rent, sell or otherwise transfer your personal data without your consent, except as otherwise set out in this Privacy Policy or in any specific disclosure given to you when obtaining personal data from you.

_Third Party Processors and Agents:_ Your personal data will be transferred among our family of companies or other third parties solely for the purposes of processing your request, arranging delivery of your subscription, product, or Service, and providing customer service or other services to you. We also transfer (or otherwise make available) your personal data to third parties who administer our contests and prize redemptions, or who provide circulation audit and other services on our behalf. These entities may store and process personal data in Europe, the United States, Hong Kong, and South Africa, any other jurisdictions where they operate, where privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. For more information on international transfers, see the section **"International Transfer"**below. All of our service providers are required to maintain the confidentiality and security of your personal data and to use it only in compliance with applicable data privacy laws, and are prohibited from using or disclosing your personal data for any purpose other than providing the services on our behalf or as otherwise not prohibited by applicable law; although we may permit them to use aggregate information which does not identify you or de-identified information for other purposes.

_Third Party Products and Services:_ If you are a subscriber to one of our publications or on-line newsletters, we share your contact information, with your affirmative consent, with carefully selected marketing partners who will contact you by mail or e-mail with offers about products and services that may be of interest to you. You can remove yourself from the future sharing of your contact information with third parties by contacting as set out in the **"How to Contact Us"** section below.

_Auditing Organizations:_ Auditing Organizations: We share your personal data with third-party auditing organizations, including the UK Audit Bureau of Circulation ("ABC"), so they can verify aggregated statistics and circulation usage of our products or review our policies, processes, and procedures for compliance with relevant standards. You can view ABC’s privacy policy [here](https://www.abc.org.uk/privacy-policy).

_Sale or Merger of Business:_ It is possible that all or part of Time Inc . or its subsidiaries could merge with or be acquired by another business or undergo a corporate change or dissolution such as a reorganization, consolidation, bankruptcy, liquidation, sale of assets, or wind down of business. If this happens, or in connection with discussions of such event, we may share the information that relates to you.

_Legal:_ We may be required to provide your personal data in response to a search warrant or other legally valid inquiry or order, or to an investigative body in the case of a breach of an agreement or contravention of law, or as otherwise required by law. We may also disclose personal data to assist us in collecting a debt owed by you, where necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims, to protect the rights, property, or safety of us or third parties, or to enforce our terms.

   
**Third Party Websites, Social Media, and Advertisers**

Our Services provide links to third party websites or offerings where data privacy practices may be different to that of Time Inc. The inclusion of any link does not imply our endorsement of any other company, its websites, or its products and/or services. These linked websites or offerings have separate and independent privacy policies, which we recommend you read carefully. We have no control over such websites or offerings and therefore have no responsibility or liability for the manner in which the organizations that operate such linked websites or offerings may collect, use, disclose, or otherwise treat your personal data.

You can access various social network posting and sharing tools through our Services that are operated by third parties, including a "share" button that allows you to post links to content and features that you believe will be of interest to others on your social network pages. When you visit a page that includes one of these sharing tools, the third-party company that operates the tool may be collecting information about your browser, device and online activity through its own tracking technologies and subject to its own separate privacy policy, which may differ from ours.

Our Services use third parties to present or serve the advertisements that you may see on our web pages or Apps, and to conduct research about the advertisements. This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of personal data that such third parties may have collected from you or the methods used by the third-parties to collect that information (e.g., cookies, web beacons, and clear gifs). For more information on tracking technologies and your rights and choices, see **"Cookies and Web Beacons"** above and **"Your Opt-Out Choices"** below.

   
**Your Opt-Out Choices**

If you no longer want to receive third-party email offers, simply follow the advertiser's unsubscribe link or opt-out instructions that should be included in every commercial message you receive from them.

We encourage you to review, update, and correct the personal data that we maintain about you, and you may exercise any of your rights by complete the form available [here](https://app-de.onetrust.com/app/#/webform/0c410d51-8e85-4308-9bb9-37c24a461ccb).

If you have any issues with our compliance, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a European supervisory authority.

   
**Data Controller**

EU data protection law makes a distinction between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as "controllers") and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as "processors"). Time Inc., located at 225 Liberty Street, New York, NY 10281, is the controller with respect to information you provide through the Service.

   
**International Transfer**

The personal data you provide to us is being transmitted to us and processed in the United States and by our affiliates and their service providers in Amsterdam and South Africa, and any other jurisdictions where we or they operate. Your personal data will be protected subject to this privacy policy and contracts that impose data protections as required by the country where your data was collected. By using our Services you consent to the transfer, processing, storage and access of your personal data of your personal data in and/or outside of the jurisdiction in which you reside. Courts and other authorities in these jurisdictions may, in certain circumstances, be entitled to access your personal data. If your personal data is collected in Europe, we will transfer your personal data subject to suitable safeguards, including standard contractual clauses where appropriate.

   
**Security of Personal Data**

We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, loss, modification, disclosure, and any form of unlawful processing of personal data in our custody and control, and our service providers are bound to maintain similar safeguards. These measures also aim at preventing unnecessary collection and further processing of personal data. Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard the personal data in our custody and control, and we require similar safeguarding measures from our service providers, we need you to understand that we are unable to guarantee the security of your personal data.

To provide you with an increased level of security online, access to your personal data on certain of our websites may be protected with a password you select. We strongly recommend that you do not disclose your password to anyone. We will never ask you for your password in any unsolicited communication.

Please note that we may continue to retain personal data for purposes of our legitimate interests, including as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud, and enforce our agreements. Data subjects located in Europe have the right to request that we delete their personal data as set forth in the **"Accessing, Correcting, and Deleting your Personal Data"** section above.
