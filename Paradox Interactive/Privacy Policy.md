Some of these partners and their servers are located outside of the European Union (“EU”) and the European Economic Area (“EEA''). Before we transfer any of your personal data to such a service provider, we make sure that we and they will provide appropriate safeguards to protect your personal data.

We may continue to use data that is not identifiable to you (for example, aggregated data).
