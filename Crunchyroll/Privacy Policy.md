1. INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE

We may collect the following categories of personally identifiable information (“**Personal Data**”) you provide to us when using the Content:

1. **Identification Data:** Information that allows us to differentiate you from other individuals. This may include: name and surname, date of birth, gender, postal address, and password.
    
2. **Contact Information:** Information that allows us to keep in touch with you. This may include: email address and phone number.
    
3. **Electronic Records:** This information includes certain data from you or your device that are obtained when you access our Content.
    
4. **User-Generated Content:** We may also collect information that you provide to us through our Content, such as photographs, video images or other content that you may upload.
    
5. **Usage Information:** We and our third-party partners and service providers, such as Google Analytics and/or Adobe Analytics, may use a variety of technologies that collect and provide information about how the Content is accessed and used. Usage Information may consist of your internet browser type and version, operating system, service provider, the webpages and apps you viewed, the time you viewed them and for how long, game history and skill level, demographic information about you (such as your age, gender, language, location and interest areas, where available), your location, time zone, language, and what webpages you looked at before viewing the current page.
    
6. **Device Identifiers:** We may also automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier for the computer, mobile device, technology or other device you use to access the Content. A unique identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your device when you access a web site or its servers, and our computers identify your device by this number. Some mobile service providers may also provide us with the physical location of the device used to access the Content.
    

2. INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM THIRD PARTIES

The Content may include hyperlinks in association with the Content, plug-ins, websites, locations, platforms, applications or services operated by third parties ("**Third-Party Service(s)**"). These Third-Party Services may use their own cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technology to independently collect information about you and may solicit Personal Data from you. Their privacy policies apply in such cases, and not this Policy.

Certain functionalities on the Content permit interactions that you initiate between the Content and certain Third-Party Services, such as third-party social networks ("**Social Features**"). Examples of Social Features include: enabling you to send content such as contacts and photos between the Content and a Third-Party Service; “liking” or “sharing” SPE’s content; logging in to the Content using your Third-Party Service account (_e.g._, using Facebook Connect to sign-in to the Service); and to otherwise connect the Content to a Third-Party Service (_e.g._, to pull or push information to or from the Content). If you use Social Features, and potentially other Third-Party Services, information you post or provide access to may be publicly displayed on the Content or by the Third-Party Service that you use. Similarly, if you post information on a Third-Party Service that references the Content (_e.g._, by using a hashtag associated with SPE or Sony group companies in a tweet or status update), your post may be used on or in connection with the Content or otherwise by SPE and Sony group companies. Also, both SPE and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Content and any Third-Party Service.

4. COOKIES AND SIMILAR TRACKING TECHNOLOGY

Cookies, web beacons (also known as "tracking pixels") and other tracking technologies may be used by SPE and third parties including other Sony group companies to collect information about interactions with the Content or emails, including information about your browsing and purchasing behavior. These cookies and similar tracking technologies allow us to recognize you when you visit a site, or app, or open an email – they perform several different functions, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving your experience.

We use tracking technologies for three purposes:

1. **To provide you with the service you have requested:** for example, keeping you logged in during your visit and ensuring security of the Content.
    
2. **To show adverts that are more relevant to your interests:** for example, with your consent, we use tracking technologies to remember Content that has interested you and then use this to help us serve more relevant ads to you, including when you are on another site. Tracking technologies also help limit the number of times that you see an ad, measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns and help us and others track whether ads have been properly displayed. We also allow other organizations to use tracking technologies for these advertising purposes too. To learn more about certain cookies used for interest based advertising by third parties, including through cross-device tracking, and to exercise certain choices regarding such cookies, please visit the [Digital Advertising Alliance](https://optout.aboutads.info/#!/), [Network Advertising Initiative](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/#/), [Digital Advertising Alliance-Canada](https://youradchoices.ca/choices), [European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance](https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) or your device settings.
    
    We may also work with third-party platforms and websites (such as social networking platforms) to serve targeted advertisements on such third-party services and platforms to you or others, and we may convert your email address, telephone number, or other information into a unique value and provide it to these third-party platforms for matching purposes. You may opt-out of the use of your information for such purposes by unsubscribing from our marketing email communications as described in this Policy and as described below.
    
3. **To analyze and improve your browsing experience:** to analyze which Content is most popular and gets viewed the most and which gets viewed the least, and to provide us with general information about users of the Content (such as age, gender and interest areas). We also check for bugs and glitches in the Content and remember the choices you have made, such as your language or region, to enhance and personalize your experience. We use analytics services provided by Adobe, Google, and others to help us analyze and improve your browsing experience as outlined in this paragraph. If you don’t want us to use information about your visits in this way, click [here](https://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html) for Adobe and [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) for Google, to opt-out of their services, and for other analytics services follow the instructions below.

You can turn off precise geo-location tracking through the location settings on your device and/or in our Content (if available).

**_PlayStation, Apple iOS, Android Devices, and Other Connected Devices_**

We may share your Personal Data in the following circumstances:

1. **With your consent.** If we ask you for consent to share your Personal Data with third parties for their own marketing purposes, and if you give consent, we will share Personal Data with these third parties. We do not share your Personal Data with third parties for their own marketing unless you agree. You also may specifically request, sometimes through your use of an interactive feature, a widget or an application, that we share your Personal Data with a third party and we will typically do so under those circumstances. In addition, if you choose to register for a promotion, such as a competition, prize draw or contest, your Personal Data may be disclosed to third parties for purposes of the administration of such promotion. This may also mean that your Personal Data will be included on a winners list or best placed. If you submit user-generated content to a site or app, this content will be disclosed publicly.
    
2. **Third Parties Providing Services on Our Behalf.** We share data with our business partners, as well as third parties who perform functions on our behalf, such as hosting or operating our site and apps, sending emails, and carrying out data analysis.

In this case, your Personal Data may be transferred to the purchaser or prospective purchaser to the extent permitted by law, either as part of the transaction or during any due diligence process.
    
5. **Mandatory Disclosures and Legal Protections.** We may share information with government and law enforcement authorities and with other parties involved in, or contemplating, legal proceedings to comply with a legal obligation, when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, to verify or enforce our Terms of Use posted in association with this Policy or where this is necessary for us or for third parties to protect our or their rights, property, safety, or security.
    

6. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA

Our Content is hosted and operated by us or our service providers in the United States and other countries. As such, your Personal Data will be transferred to and processed in the United States and other countries that may not provide the same level of data protection as your home country. We provide appropriate protections for international transfers as required by law for international data transfers. With respect to transfers originating from the European Economic Area ("**EEA**"), we implement standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission, and other appropriate solutions to address cross-border transfers as required by applicable law. Where required by such laws, you may request a copy of the suitable mechanisms we have in place by contacting us as detailed below. Where your consent is required by applicable law, by using the Content and providing us with your Personal Data, you consent to the international transfer of your Personal Data.

7. YOUR RIGHTS

Where required by applicable law, you may have the right to obtain confirmation that we maintain certain Personal Data relating to you, to verify its content, origin, and accuracy, as well as the right to access, review, port, delete, or to block or withdraw consent to the processing of certain Personal Data (without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal). In particular, you may ask us not to use your Personal Data when we carry out profiling for direct marketing purposes or any other processing based on your consent.

Please visit [this page](https://sites.sonypictures.com/corp/privacypolicies/b2c/contact-us.html) in order to submit a request to exercise your applicable rights and to contact us with general privacy-related questions.

Further, we reserve the right to retain your Personal Data (a) as permitted by applicable law; (b) as required by applicable law; and (c) for so long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes for which the data is retained except to the extent prohibited by applicable law.

You can opt out of receiving email newsletters by following the opt-out instructions provided to you in those emails.

9. OTHER IMPORTANT ISSUES

1. Some jurisdictions require an explanation of the legal basis for the collection and processing of Personal Data. We have several different legal grounds on which we collect and process Personal Data, including: (a) as necessary to perform a transaction (such as in order to provide the products and services you requested); (b) as necessary to comply with a legal obligation (such as when we use Personal Data for record keeping); (c) consent (where you have provided consent as appropriate under applicable law); and (d) necessary for legitimate interests (such as when we act to maintain our business generally, including maintaining the safety and security of the Content).
    
2. You are not required to provide all Personal Data identified in this Privacy and Cookies Policy to use our Content or to interact with us offline, but certain functionality will not be available if you do not provide certain Personal Data. If you do not provide certain Personal Data, we may not be able to respond to your request, perform a transaction with you, or provide you with marketing that we believe you would find valuable.
    
3. We do not use automated decision-making without human intervention, including profiling, in a way that produces legal effects concerning you or otherwise significantly affects you.
    
4. For Personal Data that we collect and process for other purposes described above, we typically retain such Personal Data for no longer than the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy and Cookies Policy and as otherwise needed to address tax, corporate, compliance, litigation, and other legal rights and obligations. We generally retain Personal Data related to marketing activities for the time period permitted by applicable law, and upon request we will securely delete such data in accordance with applicable law.
