**Terms of Service** 
=====================

These Terms of Service (the “**Terms**”) establish the relationship between you (“**you**” or “**User**”) and Crunchyroll, LLC (“**Crunchyroll**,” “**we**,” “**us**,” or “**our**”) regarding your access to and use of our website, streaming services, mobile apps, our products and services or any related features (collectively, “**Services**”). For clarity, we may offer certain products or services that are governed by a distinct set of terms and conditions. Unless otherwise specifically included within these Terms, our Services do not include products and services on which we post a separate set of terms and conditions that governs such use.

By creating an Account, clicking “**I agree**”, or otherwise accessing or using any Service, you are binding yourself to these Terms, and you further acknowledge that the collection, use, disclosure, and other handling of information from the Services shall be as described in our Privacy Policy. If you don't agree with these Terms, you may not use any Crunchyroll Product.

All references to “**you**” or “**your**,” as applicable, mean the primary Account holder that purchases, accesses, uses, and/or participates in the Services, and each of your heirs, assigns, and successors. If you use the Services on behalf of another individual, you affirm that you have the authority to bind that entity or individual, your acceptance of these Terms will be deemed an acceptance by that individual.

IMPORTANT NOTE: PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY AS THEY MAY IMPACT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN US. SPECIFICALLY, PLEASE REFER TO THE SECTION TITLED “**SETTLING DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND CRUNCHYROLL**,” WHICH REQUIRES THAT CERTAIN DISPUTES BE SETTLED THROUGH MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND PRECLUDE YOU FROM LEADING OR PARTICIPATING IN A CLASS ACTION, AS WELL AS THE SECTIONS TITLED “**CLASS ACTION WAIVER**” AND “**ARBITRATION AGREEMENT**,” WHICH CONTAIN A CLASS ACTION WAIVER AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER FOR NON-ARBITRABLE DISPUTES.

**1\. Scope**  
---------------

These Terms governs your use of the Services, including the subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) library and digital reader, Crunchyroll Games, the Crunchyroll Store, the Digital Wallet, and all other related software, features, and functionality.

Certain features or functionality related to a specific Service may be subject to additional terms and conditions. In the event of a conflict between any term of these Terms and any supplemental terms, the supplemental terms shall govern with respect to the specific feature or functionality. For example, any sweepstakes, contests, or promotions will be subject to separate supplemental terms and official rules. 

**2\. Eligibility, Accounts, and Teen Profiles**
------------------------------------------------

_Accounts_ 

The Services we offer require you to create an account. You must be at least 18 years of age (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction of residence, if higher) to create a Crunchyroll account (“**Account**”) and to subscribe to or purchase access to the Services. By creating an Account, you affirm that you meet the applicable age requirement and that all information you provide is accurate, complete, and up to date. You agree to promptly update your Account information if it changes. Crunchyroll may, directly or through other parties, take reasonable steps to verify the information you provide to enforce these Terms and applicable laws. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password, and you will not have to reveal it to any Crunchyroll representative. You are solely responsible for all activity that occurs on your Account, and we may assume that any communications we receive under your Account have been made by you. Please notify us if you suspect any unauthorized use of your Account. We will not be liable, and you may be liable for losses, damages, liability, expenses, and attorney’s fees incurred by us or a third party arising from someone else using your Account due to your conduct regardless of whether you have notified us of such unauthorized use.

_Account Sharing_ 

The Services and the access granted are strictly limited to the immediate household of the primary Account holder (persons residing at the same physical residential address). You are expressly prohibited from sharing your Account credentials, transferring your user profile, or permitting access by any individual who is not a member of your immediate household. Any unauthorized sharing constitutes a material breach of these Terms.

_Profiles_ 

Crunchyroll may offer the option to personalize use of the Services through the creation of one or more profiles under your Account (each a “**Profile**”). Only the primary Account holder may create a Profile. The creation of such Profiles does not create a separate account or contract. Any individuals using a Profile are deemed "**Authorized Users**." You, as the subscriber and Account holder, are responsible for all use of your Account, including use by any Authorized Users (including Profiles) and any other members of your household. You are responsible for others who you allow to access your Account or to create Profiles within your Account, and you are responsible for ensuring that they comply with these Terms and for all their activity (including their viewing choices and transactions).

Parents or legal guardians may create Profiles for individuals aged 13 to 17 within their Account (each, a “**Teen Profile**”). Teen Profiles are designed to provide limited access to the Services and may include content restrictions, PIN protection options, or other parental control features made available by Crunchyroll. Individuals aged 13 to 17 may access the Services only under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian through a Teen Profile. You understand the Services are not intended for users under 13.

Without limiting other obligations in these Terms, by creating or allowing a Teen Profile, the parent or legal guardian: (a) affirms that the Teen Profile shall be used only by a minor thirteen years or older; (b) consents to the minor’s use of the Services under their supervision; and (c) acknowledges that the Services may include Content (as defined below) that is not suitable for minors, and that it is the Account holder’s sole responsibility to determine what Content is appropriate (regardless of age ratings for Services and Content) and to configure available parental controls accordingly. 

Teen Profiles may not have the same level of functionality, features, or access as adult Accounts or other Profiles and may be subject to additional data handling or privacy measures consistent with our [Privacy Policy.](https://www.sonypictures.com/corp/privacy.html)  

_Device Limits and Concurrent Streams_. 

Your Subscription may permit access to the Services on a limited number of devices and/or concurrent streams, as specified at the time you subscribe and as updated by us from time to time. We may limit the number of simultaneous streams or registered devices associated with your Account, and we may enforce such limits using technical measures. You agree not to exceed any such stream or device limits, and you acknowledge that doing so constitutes a material breach of these Terms. We may, in our sole discretion, analyze the use of your Account to determine compliance with these provisions. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that you have violated these Terms, we reserve the right to block or deactivate devices, limit or terminate access, where we reasonably believe such devices are being used in violation of these Terms, including in connection with password sharing or other unauthorized access. You are solely responsible for all use of your Account, including the use of your Account by others.

_Suspension and Termination of Access to Services_ 

Crunchyroll reserves the right to suspend, limit, or terminate your Account and your access to the Services for any reason or no reason whatsoever, with or without notice, including if we determine, in our sole discretion, that you have breached any material term of these Terms, including non-payment, violation of the Account sharing limitation above, or attempted circumvention of security measures. Upon the termination of your Account, all licenses and access rights granted to you under these Terms shall immediately and irrevocably cease, and if terminated due to your breach, you shall not be entitled to any refund, credit, or proration of any fees paid in advance.

**3\. Payments, Billing and Financial Transactions**
----------------------------------------------------

_Making a Payment Directly with Crunchyroll_ 

You may make purchases of a Service directly through us. If you purchase a subscription to a Service (each, a “**Subscription**”), you agree that your Subscription will automatically renew at the stated frequency for the then-current subscription price (“**Fee**”), together with any taxes and other charges, applicable to your territory, until you cancel. For any purchase, you authorize us to charge your selected payment method (the "**Payment Method**") for the applicable Fee, taxes, and any other charges incurred. Your Payment Method will automatically be charged the applicable Fee, taxes and other charges on the renewal processing date on a recurring basis without requiring your prior approval, as permitted by applicable law, unless you cancel, or your Account is terminated, before that date. Unless stated otherwise, Fees include any applicable sales, use, value-added (VAT), goods and services (GST), or other similar taxes, charges, or assessments as required by law, which may vary depending on your billing address and applicable tax rules.  
  
We may verify your Payment Method by processing an authorization hold. If you do not update your Payment Method or duly cancel your Subscription before it automatically renews, you authorize us to continue billing, and you will remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a valid Payment Method is not activated on your Crunchyroll Account when a payment becomes due, we may restrict, suspend or cancel your Subscription due to lack of payment.  If your primary Payment Method fails, expires, or otherwise cannot be charged for any reason, you authorize us to attempt to charge any other Payment Methods saved to your Account in a waterfall sequence until the charge is successfully processed. We may determine the order in which saved Payment Methods are charged and may re-attempt previously declined Payment Methods where permitted by applicable network rules.

We may choose, in our sole discretion, to add, modify, or remove benefits and features from a Subscription. If you do not wish to continue subscribing with the modified features, you may cancel your Subscription; otherwise, you are deemed to have accepted such changes.

_Fee Changes & Errors._ 

We may modify the Fees payable from time to time. The modified Fees will take effect at the start of the next billing period. We will provide advance notice of these changes as required by applicable law, and you will have the opportunity to change or cancel your Subscription prior to incurring the new charges. We may not be able to notify you in advance of changes in applicable taxes. 

If a stated price or other material information is determined by us, in our sole discretion, to be in error, we are not under any obligation to offer you the Subscription at that price and reserve the right to cancel, terminate or not process your order (including accepted orders). We will notify you of the error and either provide you with a refund or give you the opportunity to cancel your order and obtain a refund if payment has already been made.

_Third Party Subscriptions_ 

If you purchase a Subscription through an application store, internet or TV provider, mobile carrier or other authorized third-party platform (“**Third-Party Subscription Provider**”), your Subscription will be managed directly by the applicable Third-Party Subscription Provider. Contact your Third-Party Subscription Provider for information about billing, cancellation, and refunds. We will not honor any purchases made through unauthorized resellers and may cancel such Subscriptions at any time without prior notice to you. 

_Free Trials & Promotional Offers_ 

Crunchyroll may, from time to time, offer access to a Service on a free trial basis for a limited time ("**Trial Subscription**"). The duration of the Trial Subscription (e.g., 7 days, 14 days, or an extended promotional period) will be specified at the time of sign-up. Specific promotional offers, including discounted prices and those offered through third parties (e.g., mobile carriers, internet providers, or bundled services), are subject to the specific terms disclosed at the time of the offer. No refunds, adjustments, or price protection will be applied to your subscription Fee in the event of subsequent promotional offers.

**Eligibility:** Trial Subscriptions are limited to subscribers who meet specific eligibility criteria defined in the offer terms or promotion. Your status as an eligible subscriber is determined by Crunchyroll, or your Third-Party Subscription Provider, in its sole discretion. You may be limited in your ability to combine promotions. If your Subscription is ever cancelled or terminated for any reason, and you purchase an additional Subscription, you may not be eligible for a free trial or another discounted price offer.  We reserve the right to revoke a Trial Subscription offer or cancel your Trial Subscription if we determine, in our sole discretion, you were ineligible for such offer. You must provide a valid Payment Method to claim a Trial Subscription and is subject to any other applicable terms. 

**Automatic Conversion and Billing**: Unless you timely cancel your Trial Subscription before the end of the free trial period, your Subscription will automatically convert to the paid subscription plan selected at sign-up, and you will be automatically charged to your Payment Method immediately at the then-current rate (plus any applicable taxes and other charges). If you have a discounted Trial Subscription, unless you cancel your Subscription prior to the end of the trial period, we will begin billing your Payment Method at the then-current, non-promotional rate (plus any applicable taxes and other charges) and your subscription will continue to automatically renew at the then-applicable rate unless you cancel. Crunchyroll will not notify you that your Trial Subscription is about to end unless such notice is required by applicable law. To avoid being charged the applicable Fees, you must cancel your Trial Subscription before the trial period ends.

**Early Cancellation of Trial Subscription**: If you have subscribed to a Trial Subscription and you cancel your Trial Subscription within the trial period, you will immediately lose access to the Subscription Service and you will no longer be able to access any benefits or features related to the Subscription Service.  If you acquired your Trial Subscription through a Third-Party Subscription Provider or through another third-party offer, you may retain access to your Subscription Service for the duration of the promotional offer, after which your access to the Subscription Service will end.

_Subscription Cancellation and Pausing._ 

You may cancel your automatically-renewing Subscription at any time, before the date your Subscription renewal is processed by managing your [Account settings](https://www.crunchyroll.com/payments/manage). If you purchased your Subscription through a Third-Party Subscription Provider, you will need to contact the third-party directly, or follow instructions provided by the third-party, to cancel or make changes to your Subscription. When you cancel a Subscription, you cancel only future charges associated with your Subscription and you will continue to receive access to the Subscription Service until the end of the then-current Subscription period (unless we provide you with a refund or otherwise allow you to use the unused portion towards another service or subscription). You will also forfeit any service or referral credits and unredeemed benefits of the Subscription upon cancellation.

You may pause your Subscription for a specific time period (“**Paused State**”) if you have a monthly membership and are not on a Trial Subscription at the time of the pause. When you pause your Subscription, your Paused State will begin once your current billing cycle ends. Once your Paused State expires, you will be charged the applicable Fees and your Subscription will automatically renew for the next billing cycle. You must pause at least 24 hours before your billing date to avoid being charged for the next billing cycle. You may resume your Subscription at any time.

_Statutory Cancellation Right for EU Residents Only._ 

If you are an EU resident, you are entitled to cancel your purchase and request a refund without stating the reason during the 14 days following the date of your purchase (the “**Statutory Cancellation Period**”). The refund will cover the relevant Fees prorated from the date you request cancellation to the end of the relevant Subscription period you have paid for. To cancel and request a refund under the Statutory Cancellation Period please submit a ticket through the [Crunchyroll Help Center](https://help.crunchyroll.com/hc/en-us).

_Services Related to Subscriptions and Payments_.

**6\. Digital Manga & Games Supplemental Terms**
------------------------------------------------

The “**Digital Manga Service**” refers to the digital manga subscription service provided through the Crunchyroll Manga platform, which grants access to a library of Digital Content (as defined below) as specified in your Subscription with Crunchyroll.

For the purposes of these Digital Manga Supplemental Terms, the following terms are defined as follows:

*   “**Digital Content**” means any and all digital manga, comics, graphic novels, and related text, artwork, and metadata available for reading through the Service.
    
*   “**Reading Period**” means the period during which you have an active, paid Subscription to the Service.
    

**Access**. The Digital Manga Service provides you with a limited, personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to access and read the Digital Content during your Reading Period. This is a subscription access model, not a purchase model. You do not own the Digital Content, even after payment of subscription fees. Your access continues only as long as your Subscription is current.

**Content Availability and Changes and Reading Limitations**. The specific Digital Content available through the Digital Manga Service is subject to the availability limitations provided in Section 7 of these Terms. We make no guarantee that any specific Digital Content will be available for any length of time. Content may be added to, removed from, or made unavailable within the Digital Manga Service at the sole discretion of the content owners or us. Your license to access and read specific Digital Content automatically terminates upon the removal of that Digital Content from the Digital Manga Service.

Digital Content is provided solely for reading purposes through the designated Digital Manga Service interface. The Digital Manga Service is designed to prevent copying, downloading, saving, or printing of Digital Content.  
  
**One-Time Purchases**. We may offer individual digital manga chapters or volumes for a one-time purchase fee ("**Digital Manga Purchase**"). You will be charged for such Digital Manga Purchases at the time of transaction. For clarity, you are acquiring a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable right to view the specific chapter or volume (each, a “**Digital Manga Chapter**”) digitally through the Digital Manga Service for your personal, non-commercial use only. The purchase of Digital Manga Chapter does not constitute a sale of the underlying Content or any intellectual property rights. Once purchased, Digital Manga Chapters are non-refundable, except as required by mandatory consumer laws in your jurisdiction.

**Third-Party Beneficiaries**. You acknowledge that the content publishers and creators who provide the Digital Content are intended third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and they may enforce these terms directly against you.

**Games.** Use of any games or interactive experiences available through our Services is subject to separate Game Terms, which apply in addition to these Terms.

**7\. Accessibility, Content Ratings & Availability and Viewing Limitations**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Accessibility_

Certain Content may be made available with accessibility features, such as closed captions, subtitles, and other access services. However, not all Content will be available with all such features, in all languages, or on all devices. The availability, quality, and accuracy of captions, subtitles, and other accessibility features may vary and may depend on the source material and technical limitations. To the extent permitted by law, we do not warrant that captions, subtitles, or other accessibility features will be error-free or available at all times.

_Content Ratings and Availability_

The Services include a broad range of Content. You acknowledge and accept that Content may elicit varying reactions among different people. You may come across Content that you find offensive, indecent, explicit, or objectionable. Furthermore, Content types, genres, categories, and descriptions are provided solely as suggestions to help with navigation, and Crunchyroll does not warrant or guarantee that you will agree with them. You expressly acknowledge and assume these subjective risks inherent in utilizing the Services. Content may be edited, reformatted, or otherwise modified from its original version. The availability of Content may change from time to time and from place to place and may vary based on your Subscription.  

Some Content may contain flashing lights, patterns, or other elements that may trigger sensitivities (including photosensitive epilepsy). Where required by law or by applicable content-rating guidelines, we will provide advisories, or warnings; however, we do not guarantee that all possible sensitivities or triggers will be identified. It is your responsibility to review available information (including ratings, synopses, and tags) and to determine whether Content is appropriate for you and your Account users. 

The availability of certain Services and any Content related to a Crunchyroll Product may be limited to distribution due to licensing agreements, in certain geographic locations, and regulatory compliance. For that reason, Crunchyroll may utilize different technologies and verification methods to determine your geographic location and ensure compliance with these territorial restrictions. This may require you to enable location access on your compatible device to access certain Services or specific Content.  You agree to use the Services only in the countries or regions where it is officially offered by Crunchyroll.

_Prohibited Location Access; Offline Viewing and Download Rights_ 

Accessing Content from locations where we do not have rights, that is not offered on your Subscription, or where we do not make the Services available is prohibited.

If Crunchyroll authorizes the temporary download of Content, including Digital Manga Purchases (the "**Downloaded Content**"), the Content remains licensed, not sold. Your use of Downloaded Content is subject to all terms of these Terms. Downloaded Content is licensed only for viewing during the term of your active Subscription, on a maximum number of authorized devices, and is subject to mandatory expiration rules (including time-outs and required periodic online verification).

The Services may also include personalized features, such as recommendations, curated collections, or ordering of Content, based on your activity, preferences, device information, and other signals as described in our Privacy Policy. We may use automated systems, including algorithms and AI-powered tools, to provide this personalization.

Where required by applicable law, you may have certain rights to object to or limit personalization and certain forms of automated processing, including the ability to object to, limit, or withdraw your consent to such processing, which you can exercise through your account settings (where available) or as described in our Privacy Policy.

**13\. Settling Disputes Between You and Crunchyroll**
------------------------------------------------------

As detailed in this section, all disputes arising out of, relating to, or in connection with these Terms or your use of the Services (“**Disputes**”) must be resolved first through an informal dispute resolution process. In the event that process fails, all Disputes (except those identified in Section 13.5) will be resolved through binding arbitration.

**_13.1._**_Informal Dispute Resolution_

Unless otherwise noted in this Section 13, you and Crunchyroll agree that if any Dispute arises between us, both parties will first try to resolve it informally before initiating any formal dispute resolution proceeding. 

To initiate informal dispute resolution, the initiating party must first send a written description of the Dispute to the other party (“**Notice of Dispute**”). For any Dispute against Crunchyroll that you initiate, you agree to send to Crunchyroll at legal@crunchyroll.com (a) a written description of the Dispute and (b) the email address(es) associated with your relationship with Crunchyroll. The Notice of Dispute must be on an individual basis and provide at least: your name; a description of the nature of the Dispute with sufficient detail for Crunchyroll to assess its merits; and the specific relief sought. For any Dispute that Crunchyroll initiates, we will send our Notice of Dispute to the email address associated with your account if we can reasonably identify such an address.

You and Crunchyroll agree, following receipt of the Notice of Dispute, to negotiate in good faith about the Dispute through an informal telephonic conference. That conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party intends to commence individual arbitration; multiple individuals initiating claims cannot participate in the same informal conference. If either party is represented by counsel, that party’s counsel may participate in the conference, but the party also must appear at and participate in the conference, unless one party states in writing that the other party need not participate.

If the Dispute is not fully resolved within sixty (60) days after the non-initiating party receives the Notice of Dispute, you and Crunchyroll agree to resolve any remaining aspects of the Dispute through the procedures set forth below.

Good faith participation in the above-described informal dispute resolution process is a prerequisite to either party initiating arbitration. The parties agree that any applicable statute of limitations period or other deadlines will be tolled while the parties engage in informal dispute resolution. The parties further agree that whether a complaining party has satisfied these Informal Dispute Resolution procedures is an issue that can be decided by a court as a prerequisite to arbitration.

Nothing in this paragraph is intended to prohibit the parties from engaging directly in communications to resolve the initiating party’s claims before, during, or after the sending of a Notice of Dispute.

**_13.2_**_.Arbitration Agreement_

If Informal Dispute Resolution efforts fail, then either party may initiate binding arbitration using the procedures set forth below as the sole means to resolve claims. To initiate an arbitration, you or Crunchyroll must file a demand for arbitration with National Arbitration and Mediation (“**NAM**”). After filing a copy of the demand with NAM, you must also email a copy to legal@crunchyroll.com. If Crunchyroll is initiating arbitration, it will serve a copy of the demand to the email address associated with your Crunchyroll account. You and Crunchyroll agree that all Disputes shall be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration in accordance with this Section 13 (the “**Arbitration Agreement**”). This includes claims that arose, were identified, or involve facts occurring before the existence of this Arbitration Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Arbitration Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act ("**FAA**") and evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. You and Crunchyroll expressly agree that the FAA shall exclusively govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.

Except as set forth in Section 13.5, the arbitrator, and not any court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of the Terms and the Arbitration Agreement, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms or the Arbitration Agreement are void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, and any dispute regarding the payment of administrative or arbitrator fees (including the timing of such payments and remedies for nonpayment). The arbitrator may grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions in accordance with the arbitration provider rules and procedures for any frivolous claims or submissions the arbitrator determines have not been filed in good faith, as well as for a party's bad faith failure to comply with this section.

The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND CRUNCHYROLL BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION PROCEDURE ARE EACH IN EFFECT WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

**_13.3_**_.Arbitration Location_

Any arbitration not conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator under as contemplated by Section 13.6 shall be conducted via videoconference or telephone conference unless the parties agree otherwise. Regardless of whether the arbitration is conducted via documents, via video conference or telephone conference, or in person, for arbitrations you initiate, if you are a resident of the United States the arbitration will take place in the county where you reside, or if no NAM arbitrator is available in that county, then at the closest NAM arbitration location available in the state. Where Crunchyroll initiates arbitration, and for residents in Canada (and anywhere else outside the United States), regardless of whether the arbitration is conducted via documents, via video conference or telephone conference, or in person the arbitration shall take place in the County of New York, State of New York, United States of America, unless you and Crunchyroll otherwise agree or unless the designated arbitrator determines that such venue would be unreasonably burdensome to any party, in which case the arbitrator shall have the discretion to select another venue despite either party’s initial selection. For purposes of arbitrations conducted via documents or video conference or telephone conference  for an arbitration to “take place” in a particular location means that the arbitrator will be in that location (to the extent possible). For any arbitration conducted in New York, you and Crunchyroll agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in New York County, New York, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and in connection with any such proceeding, further agree to accept service of process by U.S. mail and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available. 

**_13.4_**_.Class Action Waiver_

You and Crunchyroll acknowledge and agree that, to the maximum extent allowed by law, and except as otherwise set out in this Section 13.4 and Section 13.6 below relating to batching, any arbitration shall be conducted in an individual capacity only and not as a class or other representative action, and the arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief; notwithstanding this acknowledgement and agreement, you agree that any arbitration involving you may proceed on a consolidated basis if Crunchyroll provides its consent to consolidate in writing.

With the exception of this Section 13.4 and Section 13.6’s Batch Arbitration provision, if any part of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the balance of this Arbitration Agreement shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, provision(s) were not contained herein. If, however, this Section 13.4 and Section 13.6’s Batch Arbitration provision is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, and neither you nor Crunchyroll shall be entitled to arbitrate their Dispute. Nothing in this Section prevents you or Crunchyroll from agreeing to participate in a class-wide settlement of claims.

**_13.5_**_.Exceptions to Arbitration_

Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also elect to have disputes or claims resolved in a small claims court that are within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction regardless of what forum the filing party initially chose. Either party may also seek a declaratory judgment or similar relief in court regarding whether a party’s claims are time-barred or may be brought in small claims court. If a party has already submitted an arbitration demand, the other party can inform the arbitral forum that it chooses to have the Dispute heard in small claims court and the arbitral forum will close the arbitration and the Dispute will be heard in the appropriate small claims court.

Either party may elect to have disputes regarding whether a complaining party has satisfied the Informal Dispute Resolution procedures resolved by a court. Seeking such relief does not waive a party’s right to arbitration, and any filed arbitrations related to any action filed pursuant to this paragraph shall automatically be stayed pending the outcome of such action.

**_13.6_**_.Arbitration Rules_

The arbitration will be administered by NAM and conducted before a sole arbitrator in accordance with NAM rules, including, as applicable, NAM Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, Fees For Disputes When One of the Parties is a Consumer, and the Mass Filing Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures in effect at the time any demand for arbitration is filed with NAM, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class or representative actions. The applicable NAM rules and procedures are available at [www.namadr.com](http://www.namadr.com/).

The arbitrator shall apply New York law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law.

If the amount in controversy is $10,000 or less and you do not seek injunctive or declaratory relief, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Crunchyroll submit to the arbitrator, unless the parties agree otherwise.

Subject to the applicable NAM rules and procedures, the parties agree that the arbitrator can allow the filing of dispositive motions. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, all arbitration proceedings will be confidential and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award. 

In the event 100 or more similar arbitration demands (those asserting the same or substantially similar facts or claims, and seeking the same or substantially similar relief) presented by or with the assistance or coordination of the same law firm(s) or organization(s) are submitted to NAM against Crunchyroll (“**Mass Filing**”), the parties agree (i) to administer the Mass Filing in batches of 100 demands per batch (with any final batch  consisting of the remaining demands) (ii) to designate one arbitrator for each batch; and (iii) provide for the resolution of each batch on a consolidated basis with one set of filing and administrative fees due per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award, which will provide for any and all relief to which the arbitrator determines each individual party is entitled, with NAM administering all batches concurrently, to the extent you agree to cooperate in good faith with Crunchyroll and the arbitration provider to implement such a “batch approach” or other similar approach to provide for an efficient resolution of claims, including the payment of combined reduced fees, set by NAM in its discretion, for each batch of claims. The parties further agree to cooperate with each other and the arbitration provider or arbitrator to establish any other processes or procedures that the arbitration provider or arbitrator believe will provide for an efficient resolution of claims. Any disagreement between the parties as to whether this provision applies or as to the process or procedure for batching shall be resolved by a procedural arbitrator appointed by NAM. If your demand for arbitration is included in the Mass Filing, your claims will remain tolled until your demand for arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or is settled.

The parties agree that this Batch Arbitration provision is integral to the Arbitration Agreement insofar as it applies to a Mass Filing. If this Batch Arbitration provision is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, and neither you nor Crunchyroll shall be entitled to arbitrate any claim that is a part of the Mass Filing.

**_13.7_**_.Arbitration Award_

If you can demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Crunchyroll will pay any filing and hearing fees in excess of $250 that the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith, in which case arbitration fees (including attorneys’ fees) may be imposed upon you consistent with the Arbitrator’s Rules and the standard for sanctions set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11. You are responsible for your own attorneys’ fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise. 

The parties agree that NAM can reduce the amount or modify the timing of any administrative or arbitration fees due under NAM’s Rules provided that such modification does not increase the costs to you, and you further agree that you waive any objection to such fee modification. The parties also agree that a good-faith challenge by either party to the fees imposed by NAM does not constitute a default, waiver, or breach of this Arbitration Agreement while such challenge remains pending before NAM, the arbitrator, and/or a court of competent jurisdiction, and that any and all due dates for those fees shall be tolled during the pendency of such challenge.

**_13.8_**_.30-Day Right to Opt-Out_

You can opt out of the Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver by notifying Crunchyroll in writing no later than thirty (30) days of your acceptance of any update to these Terms or your first use of the Service, whichever is later. Your notice must include your name and address, and the email address you used to set up your Crunchyroll Account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. You must send your opt-out notice to one of the following physical or email addresses: Crunchyroll, LLC., ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out, 5750 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 110, Los Angeles, CA 90036, USA; legal@crunchyroll.com. If you do not opt out, you shall be bound to arbitrate Disputes in accordance with the terms of the Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver. If you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement or Class Action Waiver, you or we may exercise your or our right to a trial by jury or judge, as permitted by applicable law, but any prior existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes under a prior version of this Arbitration Agreement will not apply to claims not yet filed. Crunchyroll will continue to honor any valid opt-outs if you opted out of arbitration in a prior version of the Arbitration Agreement pursuant to the requirements set forth in that version. If you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement or Class Action Waiver, Crunchyroll also will not be bound by them.

**_13.9_**_.Changes to this Section_

We will provide thirty (30) days' notice of any material changes to this Section 13 by posting a notice on the Services, informing you via email, or otherwise complying with any applicable notice or consent requirements. Material amendments will become effective on the 30th day following notice to you and will apply to all claims not yet filed unless you follow any opt-out procedure provided in the amended Terms. 

**14\. Indemnity and Release**
------------------------------

You agree to release and to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Crunchyroll and its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, and agents, as well as the officers, directors, employees, shareholders, and representatives of any of the foregoing entities, from and against any and all losses, liabilities, expenses, damages, costs (including attorneys’ fees and court costs), claims, actions, inquiries, or investigations of any kind whatsoever arising out of or resulting from your violation of these Terms, and any of your acts or omissions that implicate publicity rights, defamation, or invasion of privacy. Crunchyroll reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you and, in such case, you agree to cooperate with Crunchyroll in the defense of such matter.

In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release Crunchyroll, its officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or the Services. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which provides:

A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.

If you are not a California resident, you waive your rights under any statute or common law principle similar to Section 1542 that governs your rights in the jurisdiction of your residence.

IN NO EVENT SHALL CRUNCHYROLL OR ITS AFFILIATES, SUCCESSORS, ASSIGNS, LICENSORS, AND EACH OF THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND CONTENT PROGRAMMERS (COLLECTIVELY, THE "**CRUNCHYROLL PARTIES**"), BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE USE OF THE SERVICES, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF THE CRUNCHYROLL PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY OF THE CRUNCHYROLL PARTIES TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) EXCEED THE GREATER OF: (A) THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU TO CRUNCHYROLL FOR ACCESS TO YOUR SUBSCRIPTION IN THE 6 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM OR (B) $50.00 USD. The limitations of liability and damage caps in these Terms do not apply to liability for death, personal injury, fraud, or any liability arising from gross negligence or willful misconduct, to the extent such liability cannot be excluded under applicable mandatory law.

TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY CLAIM RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE SERVICES OR THESE TERMS MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OF THE EVENTS FIRST GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM. IF NOT COMMENCED WITHIN THIS ONE (1) YEAR PERIOD, YOU AND WE ARE EACH PERMANENTLY BARRED FROM PURSUING THAT CLAIM. 

**17\. Term and Termination**

The agreement between you and Crunchyroll reflected by these Terms is effective when you access the Services (for example to create an Account) and remains in effect until either you or we terminate the agreement in accordance with these Terms.

You may terminate your Account by managing your Account settings. We may also restrict, suspend, or terminate any Account for any reason at any time.

**18\. Export Controls and Sanctions Compliance**.
--------------------------------------------------

You agree to abide by U.S. and other applicable export control laws and agree not to transfer the Services to a foreign national or national destination, which is prohibited by such laws, without first obtaining, and then complying with, any requisite government authorization. In particular, but without limitation, the Services may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any U.S. embargoed countries or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's Specially Designated Nationals List or the U.S. Department of Commerce's Denied Persons List or Entity List. You certify that you are not a person with whom Crunchyroll is prohibited from transacting business under applicable law.

**19\. General**

**Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue**. These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, USA, without regard to its conflict of laws principles.

**Final Provisions**. These Terms, inclusive of all incorporated [Policies and Supplemental Terms](https://www.crunchyroll.com/supplementalterms), constitutes the final, complete, and exclusive legal agreement between the parties concerning the Services, entirely replacing any prior agreements. Should any provision of these Terms be declared illegal, void, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions. Furthermore, our failure to enforce any right or provision shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision, nor a waiver of our right to enforce that provision at any subsequent time. Crunchyroll may freely assign its rights and obligations under these Terms without restriction, but you may not assign these Terms without our express written consent. We shall not be deemed in breach of these Terms for any failure or delay in performance caused by circumstances beyond our reasonable control (a force majeure event). You agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in these Terms, there shall be no third-party beneficiaries to these Terms.

**Local Language Terms**

We may provide translations of these Terms into one or more languages. In the event of any inconsistency between a non-English version of these Terms and the English version, the English version shall prevail to the extent permitted by applicable law. Translated user interfaces, descriptions, subtitles, metadata, or notices are provided for convenience only and do not alter the meaning or interpretation of the English version.

**International Terms**. 

_Applicability_

If you access or use the Services from a country or territory outside the United States (“**International Territory**”), additional or different mandatory laws may apply to your use of the Services. To the extent any non-waivable consumer protection, subscription, digital content, telecommunications, media, data protection, or other mandatory local laws in your country of residence apply and conflict with these Terms, those mandatory local laws will prevail solely to the extent of such conflict. Unless expressly required by law, we do not intend for these Terms to create any local establishment, local presence, or local service provider relationship in any International Territory.

_Payments, Taxes, and Third-Party Billing Channels_

The availability of payment methods may vary across International Territories. You acknowledge that taxes, fees, and charges (including VAT, GST, digital services taxes, or similar levies) may apply based on local laws and may be added to Subscription Fees or other charges. The Services may also be offered or bundled through mobile carriers, broadband providers, device manufacturers, app stores, or other third-party channels. Where you obtain access through such a third party, their separate terms may apply in addition to these Terms, and any rights regarding billing, refunds, termination, or account management may differ accordingly.

_Content Ratings, and Local Restrictions_

Content, features, and Services may vary by International Territory due to licensing restrictions, regulatory requirements, censorship or classification rules, technical limitations, language availability, or changes in rights. We may use geolocation, IP address, or similar technologies to determine eligibility for certain Content or features and to enforce territorial restrictions. Content ratings, cultural advisories, accessibility features, and age-classification information may differ by region and may not always align with local expectations or standards.

_Features and Functionality_

Certain features, functionalities, payment options, promotional offers, or Subscription plans available in one territory may not be available in another. We may add, modify, or remove features for specific International Territories where reasonably necessary for business, legal, or technical reasons, including compliance with local regulatory requirements or platform restrictions.

_Regulatory Compliance and Reporting_

You agree that your use of the Services must comply with all applicable laws in your International Territory, including laws governing online media, digital content, age ratings, illegal or restricted content, and content takedown/reporting obligations. Where required by law (including laws similar to the EU Digital Services Act, regional broadcasting codes, or online safety regimes), we may implement additional reporting mechanisms, disclosures, or processes for handling complaints or requests from governmental or regulatory authorities.

_Privacy and Data Transfers_

By using the Services, you acknowledge that your personal data may be collected, processed, and transferred outside of your country of residence, including to the United States or other regions where we or our service providers operate, as described in our Privacy Policy. Where required by law, we implement legally recognized safeguards for such transfers, such as standard contractual clauses or equivalent mechanisms. Local data residency laws may affect availability of certain features or services.

_Mandatory Consumer Rights_

Nothing in these Terms is intended to exclude, limit, or modify any mandatory statutory rights you may have under applicable local consumer protection laws in your International Territory, including rights regarding the supply of digital content or subscription services. For residents of the European Union, the statutory right of cancellation described in Section 3.6 applies. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and such mandatory local laws, the mandatory local laws will prevail solely to the extent of the conflict.
