**2. HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION**

We may collect Personal Information about you in a variety of ways, depending on your interaction with us or certain third parties. We may also supplement the information we collect about you directly and through our Platforms with information that we receive from third parties.

*   **Directly from You**: We may collect Personal Information directly from you. This may happen in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when you use the Platforms, when you use or subscribe to services that we offer (such as Connected Services), when you use applications that we offer (such as the Toyota App), when you purchase a vehicle, and when you interact with Toyota’s Brand Engagement Center. We may also collect Personal Information from you when you submit comments to us or participate in programs. You may also provide us with written, audio or video feedback or testimonials that contain Personal Information.
*   **Publicly Available Sources**: We may collect Personal Information from publicly available sources. For example, Toyota utilizes third-party social media management services to collect and analyze publicly available information on various social media sites.
*   **From Other Individuals**: We may also collect Personal Information from other individuals. For example, some features on the Platforms may permit users to submit information about other people. If you wish to invite your friends to participate in a program offered through the Platforms or forward particular content from the Platforms to your friends, you will be asked to submit your friends' email addresses. Our use, sharing and protection of the other person's information will also be subject to the terms of the applicable program and this Privacy Statement.
*   **From Third Parties**: We may also collect Personal Information from third parties, including our affiliates (such as Toyota Financial Services and Toyota Motor Corporation), our business partners, our service providers, and certain third-party companies (such as our authorized dealers, distributors, local dealer associations, data brokers and other data providers). Information from such third parties may have been collected online, offline, or through publicly or commercially available sources. In addition, we may collect information from third parties in the ways described below:
*   _Requests to Third Parties._ Third parties may provide your information to us at your request. For example, if you are on another website and you opt in to receive information from Toyota, that website will submit to us your email address and other information about you so that we may contact you as requested.
*   _Third Party Applications and Websites; Social Media._ You may also choose to participate in a third-party application or feature (such as one of our Facebook or Twitter applications or a similar application or feature on a third-party website) or use a third-party website where you allow us to collect (or the third party to collect and share) information about you, including online activity data and other Personal Information, such as lists of your friends, "likes," comments you have shared, groups, location, and your activity on the third-party website. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on our Platforms to your profile page to share with others within your network. In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third-party website give us access to their profiles and you are one of their "connections" or information about you is otherwise accessible through your "connections'" web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third-party website or interactive service.
*   **Automatically From Your Devices**:  We may also collect the following types of Online Activity Data automatically when you use the Platforms:
*   _Usage Information._ Whenever you visit or interact with the Platforms, we, as well as any third-party advertisers and/or service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the Platforms are accessed and used ("Usage Information"). Usage Information may include browser type, device type, operating system, application version, the page served, the time, the preceding page views, and your use of features or applications on the Platforms, such as interactions with friends and group activities. This information helps us keep our Platforms fresh and interesting to our visitors and allows us to tailor content to a visitor's interests. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if Toyota associates it with you as a specific and identifiable person, Toyota treats it as Personal Information.
*   _Device Identifier._ We automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier") for the Device (computer, mobile phone, tablet or other device) you use to access the Platforms. A Device Identifier is a number that is assigned to your Device when you access a website or its servers, and our computers identify your device by its Device Identifier. We, and our affiliates, service providers, business partners, and other third parties, including authorized dealers, may use a Device Identifier to, among other things, administer the Platforms; help diagnose problems with our servers; analyze trends; track users' web page movements over time and across different websites, Platforms, or other mobile, online, or offline services; to help identify you and your shopping cart, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
*   _Cookies; Pixel Tags._ The technologies used on the Platforms to collect Usage Information, including Device Identifiers, include but are not limited to: cookies (data files placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Platforms), mobile analytics software and pixel tags (transparent graphic images, sometimes called web beacons or tracking beacons, placed on a web page or in an email, which indicates that a page or email has been viewed). Cookies may also be used to associate you with social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter and, by using one of their applications either on or otherwise connected to our Platforms (e.g., social media login credentials or vehicle configuration shared to social media), you may enable interaction between your activities on the Platforms and your activities on such social networking sites. We, or our vendors, may place cookies or similar files on your Device for security purposes, to facilitate site navigation and to personalize your experience while visiting our Platforms (such as allowing us to select which ads or offers are most likely to appeal to you, based on your interests, preferences, location or demographic information). To customize your cookie settings for Toyota.com, visit Toyota.com and click on "Cookie Consent Options".  
      
    Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser. However, please be aware that some features of the website may not function properly or may be slower if you refuse cookies. In addition, the offers we provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests. If you block or delete cookies, not all tracking that we have described in this Privacy Statement will stop.  
      
    We use cookies provided by Google Analytics and BlueKai DMP to collect statistical information about the use of the website. You can opt out of Google Analytics here: [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout "https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout") (requires you to install a browser add-on).

Except as described here, we will not provide any of your Personal Information to any third parties without your specific consent. We may share non-Personal Information, such as aggregate data and Usage Information with third parties. We may also share your information as disclosed at the time you provide your information, as set forth in this Privacy Statement and in the following circumstances:

**Third Parties Providing Services On Our Behalf.** We may share your Personal Information with third parties that perform functions on our behalf (or on behalf of our partners) such as service providers that host or operate our Platforms, analyze data, process transactions and payments, fulfill orders or provide customer service; advertisers; sponsors or other third parties that participate in or administer our Programs or provide marketing or promotional assistance and "powered by" partners or partners in co-branded sites. Your Personal Information may also be used by us or shared with our subsidiaries, affiliates, sponsors, partners, advertisers or other third parties to provide you with product information and promotional and other offers.

**Program Partners.** If you choose to participate in a Program, your Personal Information may also be shared with our Program partners and may be used by our Program partners in accordance with their own privacy policies. This Privacy Statement will not apply to that company's use of your information. Sometimes the rules, terms and conditions or disclaimers that apply to a particular Program (“Program Rules”) include additional information on how we may use the Personal Information that you provide to us through your participation in the Program. If there is a conflict between the Program Rules for a particular Program and this Privacy Statement, those applying to the particular Program will govern. Please review all of the information about a Program before you provide us with any Personal Information.

**Our Affiliates and Parent Company**: We may share your Personal Information with our affiliates, including but not limited to Toyota Financial Services, and our parent company, Toyota Motor Corporation. This information is primarily shared for business and operational purposes. Our affiliates may also use that information in accordance with their own privacy policies, including to market to you if you indicate your interest in related products or services.

**Our Dealers and Distributors**: We may share your Personal Information with our authorized dealers and their holding companies, dealer advertising associations and distributors (including local Toyota dealer associations), who may use that information in accordance with their own privacy policies, including to provide you with services or to market to you. For example, we may share information such as your name and vehicle interests with our authorized dealers to save you time during your visits and to enhance your overall dealership experience. We may also combine information about your Platform visits and share this information with our authorized dealers and other entities to provide you with enhanced experiences across Toyota-affiliated, -branded or similar Toyota-related offerings and Platforms.

**Your Agreement To Have Your Personal Information Shared.** You may have the opportunity to opt in to receive information and/or marketing offers from another company or to otherwise consent to the sharing of your information with a third party, including social networking sites such as Facebook or Twitter. If you agree to have your Personal Information shared, your Personal Information will be disclosed to the third party and the Personal Information you disclose will be subject to the privacy policy and business practices of that third party.

**Business Transfers.** In the event that Toyota is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction.

**Legal Disclosure.** We may transfer and disclose your information to third parties to comply with a legal obligation; when we believe in good faith that the law or a governmental authority requires it; in connection with a legal dispute; to verify or enforce our Terms of Use or other applicable policies; to address fraud, security or technical issues; to respond to an emergency; or otherwise to protect our rights or property or security of third parties, our customers and visitors or the public.

**5\. YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS, CHOICE AND ACCESS.**

We provide you with choices with respect to your Personal Information. If you choose to receive e-mails from us about products and other information, we strive to keep your Personal Information updated and accurate and provide you choices regarding the e-mail communications you receive from us.

If you provided Toyota with Personal Information through the Owners section of toyota.com, you may review and update that information by clicking on the Owners link on the homepage of toyota.com, registering or logging in and then clicking on "Update Profile." If you have signed up for the Toyota marketing e-mail list, you can access the Preferences page and change your user profile or unsubscribe from the Toyota e-mail list [here](https://access.toyota.com/optin_home.aspx).

For users who are not currently registered on our owner site, please call the Toyota Brand Engagement Center at [800-331-4331](tel:800-331-4331) to opt out from receiving e-mail communications from Toyota. If you receive an e-mail, you may opt-out at any time by following the opt-out instructions provided in the e-mail you receive. Your opt-out request will be processed within 10 days of the date on which we receive it.

If you are participating in a Program, you may be able to access and update the information you provided as part of your participation in the Program. Please see the section of the Platforms concerning the specific Program to determine if you are able to access your information and how to do so.

In accordance with our routine record keeping, we may delete certain records that contain Personal Information you have submitted through the Platforms. We are under no obligation to store such Personal Information indefinitely and disclaim any liability arising out of, or related to, the destruction of such Personal Information. It may not always be possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases without some residual data because of backups and other reasons. We will retain your information (including geo-location data) for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We do not control certain privacy settings and preferences maintained by our social media partners like Facebook and Twitter. If you wish to make changes to those settings and preferences, you may do so by visiting the settings page of the appropriate social media site.

If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) gives you certain privacy rights related to your Personal Information, which are in addition to any rights set forth in this Privacy Statement and the Toyota Connected Services Privacy Notice. Please visit the Toyota California Privacy Policy at [https://www.toyota.com/support/california-privacy](https://www.toyota.com/support/california-privacy) for additional information.

**6\. ADVERTISING/BEHAVIORAL TARGETING; HOW TO OPT OUT.**

We may use third-party ad network providers to help present ads on the Platforms, as well as other service providers to evaluate and provide us with information about the use of the Platforms and viewing of our content. We do not share Personal Information with these providers (unless, of course, you give us permission). Such providers may place and access cookies, pixel tags, or similar technologies on your Device to serve you ads or other content personalized to your interests which they infer from your precise location and/or your browsing on the Platforms and other sites you have visited. In doing so, the provider collects or has access to non-Personal Information such as your Usage Information. The use of cookies, pixel tags, or similar technologies by these providers is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours.

Certain web browsers may provide an option by which you may request your browser to inform websites you visit that you do not wish your activities to be tracked by cookies or other persistent identifiers, commonly called “Do Not Track Signals.” Although the websites we own and operate, including but not limited to Toyota.com, currently do not respond to Do Not Track Signals, you may choose to opt out of our use of targeting and advertising cookies on Toyota.com by visiting Toyota.com and clicking on “Cookie Consent Options.” You may also choose to block cookies with your browser. Please note that opting out of the use of such cookies on Toyota.com will not impact the use of third-party cookies by other websites, which we do not control. In addition, even if you choose to opt out of targeted advertising, you will still see advertisements while you're browsing online. However, the advertisements you see may be less relevant to you and your interests.

**7\. CHILDREN.**

The Platforms are not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect, use or disclose personally identifiable information from anyone under 13 years of age. If we determine upon collection that a user is under this age, we will not use or maintain his/her Personal Information without the parent/guardian's consent. If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13, we will make reasonable efforts to delete such information from our records.

**8\. SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION AND PHISHING SCAMS.**

We take information security seriously and use certain reasonable security measures to help protect your Personal Information. However, no electronic data transmission or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please note that we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you use the Platforms and provide us with your information at your own risk. When we collect sensitive information on our sites or within our mobile application (such as credit card number or geo-location information), we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology.

_Beware of Phishing Scams:_ There have been noticeable increases in the number of suspicious e-mails claiming that the e-mail recipient has won a Toyota lottery or other promotion. Sometimes the e-mail claims that the recipient has won a new Toyota Prius. In order to claim the prize, the e-mail asks that Personal Information be sent to a Gmail or Yahoo e-mail address.

This type of e-mail solicitation is known commonly as a "phishing" scam, with the primary objective being to obtain one's Personal Information. This information can then be utilized to steal a person's identity. For example, a "Toyota Lottery" phishing scam is often sent from Chinese (.cn), German (.de) or British (.co.uk) addresses but can originate from anywhere and look very official even to the most savvy of Internet users. Toyota will never ask you to send passwords, login names, Social Security numbers, or other Personal Information through e-mail or U.S. mail or fax or text message. If you receive an email or letter by U.S. mail or fax or text message from Toyota asking you to update your credit card information, do not respond: this is a phishing scam. Recipients of suspicious e-mail like this should delete the message from their in-box and, if possible, update their e-mail filter settings to block e-mails from the e-mail address being used. The [Federal Trade Commission](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2008/04/new-ftc-videos-help-consumers-spot-phishing-scams) and the [Antiphishing Workgroup](https://www.antiphishing.org/) are also good sources of information about these types of security threats and how they may be reported to the authorities.

**9\. OTHER SITES.**

The Platforms may contain links to other sites that we do not own or operate, such as the site for Toyota Financial Services and to sites for Toyota dealers, as well as links from advertisers, sponsors and/or partners. We do not control, recommend or endorse and are not responsible for these sites or their content, products, services or privacy policies or practices, even though they may use the Toyota name or logo on their site through an agreement with us. These other sites may send their own cookies to your Device, they may independently collect data or solicit Personal Information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. You should also independently assess the authenticity of any site which appears or claims that it is one of our Platforms (including those linked to through an email or social networking page). 

The Platforms may make available chat rooms, forums, message boards, and news groups. Remember that any information that you disclose in these areas becomes public information and is not subject to the provisions of this Privacy Statement.

**10\. CONSENT TO PROCESSING AND TRANSFER OF INFORMATION.**

The Platforms are governed by and operated in, and in accordance with the laws of, the United States, and are intended for the enjoyment of residents of the United States. Toyota makes no representation that the Platforms are governed by or operated in accordance with the laws of any other nation. Given that Toyota is an international business, our use of your information necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis. If you are located in the European Union, Canada or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect may be transferred to and processed in the United States. By using the Platforms, or providing us with any information, you (a) acknowledge that the Platforms are subject to the laws of the United States, (b) consent to the collection, processing, maintenance and transfer of such information in and to the United States and other applicable territories in which the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as or equivalent to those in the country where you reside and/or are a citizen, and (c) waive any claims that may arise under those laws.

**11\. CHANGES.**

We may update this Privacy Statement to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes, we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on our Platforms prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
