**1\. INFORMATION WE COLLECT ON OUR PLATFORMS.**

Information You Provide To Us

We may collect Personal Information (information that can be used to identify you as an individual) such as your name, email, telephone number, home address, demographic information (such as zip code, age), or payment information (such as account or credit card number). The types of Personal Information we collect may vary depending on your use of the features of the Platforms. For example, we will collect your credit card number and other payment-related information in connection with your purchase of products and/or services through the Platforms, and we will collect Personal Information when you submit comments or participate in sweepstakes, contests, games, special events, promotions, blogs and chats, and surveys ("Programs"). In addition, we may post customer testimonials/video testimonials on our Platforms which may contain personally identifiable information. We do obtain the customer's consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.

Toyota utilizes third-party social media management services to collect and analyze publicly available information on various social media sites. Information that you post on those sites, as well as publicly available information that you post on other pages made available through those sites and on other social media sites may be used by Toyota for customer satisfaction, customized marketing, marketing analysis, consumer research and other legitimate business purposes.

Friend to Friend: Some features on the Platforms may permit you to submit information about other people. For example, if you wish to invite your friends to participate in a Program offered through the Platforms or forward particular content from the Platforms to your friends, you will be asked to submit your friends' email addresses. Our use, sharing and protection of the other person's information will also be subject to the terms of the Program and this Privacy Statement.

Information We Collect Automatically

_Usage Information._ Whenever you visit or interact with the Platforms, we, as well as any third-party advertisers and/or service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the Platforms are accessed and used ("Usage Information"). Usage Information may include browser type, device type, operating system, application version, the page served, the time, the preceding page views, and your use of features or applications on the Platforms, such as interactions with friends and group activities. This information helps us keep our Platforms fresh and interesting to our visitors and allows us to tailor content to a visitor's interests. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if Toyota associates it with you as a specific and identifiable person, Toyota treats it as Personal Information.

_Device Identifier._ We automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier") for the Device (computer, mobile phone, tablet or other device) you use to access the Platforms. A Device Identifier is a number that is assigned to your Device when you access a website or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. We, and our affiliates, service provides, business partners and other third parties, including authorized dealers, may use a Device Identifier to, among other things, administer the Platforms; help diagnose problems with our servers; analyze trends; track users' web page movements over time and across different websites, Platforms, or other mobile, online, or offline services; to help identify you and your shopping cart, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

_Cookies; Pixel Tags._ The technologies used on the Platforms to collect Usage Information, including Device Identifiers, include but are not limited to: cookies (data files placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Platforms), mobile analytics software and pixel tags (transparent graphic images, sometimes called web beacons or tracking beacons, placed on a web page or in an email, which indicates that a page or email has been viewed). Cookies may also be used to associate you with social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter and, by using one of their applications either on or otherwise connected to our Platforms (e.g. social media log-in credentials or vehicle configuration shared to social media), you may enable interaction between your activities on the Platforms and your activities on such social networking sites. We, or our vendors, may place cookies or similar files on your Device for security purposes, to facilitate site navigation and to personalize your experience while visiting our Platforms (such as allowing us to select which ads or offers are most likely to appeal to you, based on your interests, preferences, location or demographic information). Please note that Dealer Advertising Associations may opt to place cookies or similar files on your Device to personalize your experience on their websites, including [www.buyatoyota.com](https://www.buyatoyota.com/). A pixel tag may tell your browser to get content from another server.

Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser. However, please be aware that some features of the website may not function properly or may be slower if you refuse cookies. In addition, the offers we provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests. If you block or delete cookies, not all tracking that we have described in this privacy statement will stop.

We use cookies provided by Google Analytics and BlueKai DMP to collect statistical information about the use of the website. You can opt-out of Google analytics, here: [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) (requires you to install a browser add-on).

**3\. SHARING OF INFORMATION**

Except as described here, we will not provide any of your Personal Information to any third parties without your specific consent. We may share non-Personal Information, such as aggregate data and Usage Information with any third parties. We may also share your information as disclosed at the time you provide your information, as set forth in this Privacy Statement and in the following circumstances:

**Third Parties Providing Services On Our Behalf.** We may share your Personal Information with third parties that perform functions on our behalf (or on behalf of our partners) such as service providers that host or operate our Platforms, analyze data, process transactions and payments, fulfill orders or provide customer service; advertisers; sponsors or other third parties that participate in or administer our promotions, contests, sweepstakes, surveys or provide marketing or promotional assistance and "powered by" partners or partners in co-branded sites. Your Personal Information may also be used by us or shared with our subsidiaries, affiliates, sponsors, partners, advertisers or other third parties to provide you with product information and promotional and other offers.

**Program Partners.** If you choose to participate in a Program, your Personal Information may also be shared with our Program partners and may be used by our Program partners if you indicate your interest in receiving communications directly from that company. If you elect to receive communications from our business partner, your information will be used by that company in accordance with its policies, and this Privacy Notice will not apply to that company's use of your information. Sometimes the rules, terms and conditions or disclaimers that apply to a particular Program include information on how we may use the Personal Information that you provide to us through your participation in the Program. If there is a conflict between the rules, terms and conditions that apply to a particular Program and this Privacy Statement, those applying to the particular Program will govern. Please review all of the information about a Program before you provide us with any Personal Information.

**Your Agreement To Have Your Personal Information Shared.** While on our Platforms, you may have the opportunity to opt-in to receive information and/or marketing offers from someone else or to otherwise consent to the sharing of your information with a third party, including social networking sites such as Facebook or Twitter. If you agree to have your Personal Information shared, your Personal Information will be disclosed to the third party and the Personal Information you disclose will be subject to the privacy policy and business practices of that third party.

**Business Transfers.** We may share your Personal Information with other entities and our affiliates primarily for business and operational purposes. We may also share your information with our authorized dealers and their holding companies, dealer advertising associations and distributors for their own use. For example, we may share information such as your name and vehicle interests with our authorized dealers to save you time during your visits and to enhance your overall dealership experience. We may also combine information about your Site and Platform visits and share this information with our authorized dealers and other entities to provide you with enhanced experiences across Toyota-affiliated, -branded or similar Toyota-related offerings and Platforms. In the event that Toyota is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction.

**Legal Disclosure.** We may transfer and disclose your information to third parties to comply with a legal obligation; when we believe in good faith that the law or a governmental authority requires it; to verify or enforce our Terms of Use or other applicable policies; to address fraud, security or technical issues; to respond to an emergency; or otherwise to protect our rights or property or security of third parties, visitors to our Platforms or the public.

  

**4\. INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM THIRD PARTIES**

We may receive information about you from third parties.

  

_Websites._ For example, if you are on another website and you opt-in to receive information from Toyota, that website will submit to us your email address and other information about you so that we may contact you as requested.

  

_Third Party Applications._ You may also choose to participate in a third party application or feature (such as one of our Facebook or Twitter applications or a similar application or feature on a third party website) through which, through your participation, you allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including Usage Information and Personal Information such as lists of your friends, "likes", comments you have shared, groups and location. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on our Platform to your profile page to share with others within your network. In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third party website give us access to their profiles and you are one of their "connections" or information about you is otherwise accessible through your "connections'" web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third party website or interactive service.

  

_Other Third Parties._ We may also receive information about you from our affiliates, service providers, business partners, and other third parties, including authorized dealers. Information from such third parties may have been collected online, offline, or through publicly- or commercially-available sources.

  

We may supplement the information we collect about you through the Platforms with such information from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content, advisements, and other offers to you and/or to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you.

  

**5\. YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS, CHOICE AND ACCESS.**

The Platforms gives you choices. If you choose to receive e-mails from us about products and other information, we strive to keep your Personal Information updated and accurate.

If you provided Toyota with Personal Information through the Owners section of toyota.com, you may review and update that information by clicking on the Owners link on the homepage of toyota.com, registering or logging in and then clicking on "Update Profile." If you have signed up for the Toyota marketing e-mail list, you can access the Preferences page and change your user profile or unsubscribe from the Toyota e-mail list [here](https://access.toyota.com/optin_home.aspx).

For users who are not currently registered on our owner site, please call Customer Satisfaction at [800-331-4331](tel:800-331-4331) to opt out from receiving e-mail communications from Toyota. If you receive an e-mail, you may opt-out at any time by following the opt-out instructions provided in the e-mail you receive. Your opt-out request will be processed within 10 days of the date on which we receive it.

If you are participating in a Program, you may be able to access and update the information you provided as part of your participation in the Program. Please see the section of the Platforms concerning the specific Program to determine if you are able to access your information and how to do so.

In accordance with our routine record keeping, we may delete certain records that contain Personal Information you have submitted through the Platforms. We are under no obligation to store such Personal Information indefinitely and disclaim any liability arising out of, or related to, the destruction of such Personal Information. It may not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases without some residual data because of backups and other reasons. We will retain your information (including geo-location data) for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We do not control certain privacy settings and preferences maintained by our social media partners like Facebook and Twitter. If you wish to make changes to those settings and preferences, you may do so by visiting the settings page of the appropriate social media site.

  

**6\. ADVERTISING/BEHAVIORAL TARGETING; HOW TO OPT-OUT.**

We may use third party ad network providers to help present ads on the Platforms, as well as other service providers to evaluate and provide us with information about the use of the Platforms and viewing of our content. We do not share Personal Information with these providers (unless, of course, you give us permission). Such providers may place and access cookies, pixel tags, or similar technologies on your Device to serve you ads or other content personalized to your interests which they infer from your precise location and/or your browsing on the Platforms and other sites you have visited. In doing so, the provider collects or has access to non-Personal Information such as your Usage Information. The use of cookies, pixel tags, or similar technologies by these providers is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours.

If you prefer to not receive targeted advertising, you can opt-out of some network advertising programs that use your information. To do so, please visit the [DAA Opt-Out Page](https://www.aboutads.info/choices/). Please note that even if you choose to opt-out of targeted advertising, you will still see advertisements while you're browsing online. However the advertisements you see may be less relevant to you and your interests. Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online browsing activities. These interest categories help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive. The DAA Opt-Out Page provides a tool that identifies its member companies that have cookies on your browser and provides links to those companies.

  

**7\. CHILDREN.**

The Platforms are not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect, use or disclose personally identifiable information from anyone under 13 years of age. If we determine upon collection that a user is under this age, we will not use or maintain his/her Personal Information without the parent/guardian's consent. If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13, we will make reasonable efforts to delete such information from our records.

  

**8\. SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION AND PHISHING SCAMS.**

We take information security seriously and use certain reasonable security measures to help protect your Personal Information. However, no electronic data transmission or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please note that we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you use the Platforms and provide us with your information at your own risk. When we collect sensitive information on our sites or within our mobile application (such as credit card number or geo-location information), we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology.

_Beware of Phishing Scams:_ There have been noticeable increases in the number of suspicious e-mails claiming that the e-mail recipient has won a Toyota lottery or other promotion. Sometimes the e-mail claims that the recipient has won a new Toyota Prius. In order to claim the prize, the e-mail asks that Personal Information be sent to a Hotmail or Yahoo e-mail address. Samples of these hoax e-mails can be found at [this web site](https://www.hoax-slayer.net/toyota-car-promotions-scam/).

This type of e-mail solicitation is known commonly as a "phishing" scam, with the primary objective being to obtain one's personal information. This information can then be utilized to steal a person's identity. For example, a "Toyota Lottery" phishing scam is often sent from Chinese (.cn), German (.de) or British (.co.uk) addresses but can originate from anywhere and look very official even to the most savvy of Internet users. Toyota will never ask you to send passwords, login names, Social Security numbers, or other personal information through e-mail or U.S. mail or fax or text message. If you receive an email or letter by U.S. mail or fax or text message from Toyota asking you to update your credit card information, do not respond: this is a phishing scam. Recipients of suspicious e-mail like this should delete the message from their in-box and, if possible, update their e-mail filter settings to block e-mails from the e-mail address being used. The [Federal Trade Commission](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2008/04/new-ftc-videos-help-consumers-spot-phishing-scams) and the [Antiphishing Workgroup](https://www.antiphishing.org/) are also good sources of information about these types of security threats and how they may be reported to the authorities.

  

**9\. OTHER SITES.**

The Platforms may contain links to other sites that we do not own or operate, such as the site for Toyota Financial Services and to sites for Toyota dealers, as well as links from advertisers, sponsors and/or partners. We do not control, recommend or endorse and are not responsible for these sites or their content, products, services or privacy policies or practices, even though they may use the Toyota name or logo on their site through an agreement with us. These other sites may send their own cookies to your Device, they may independently collect data or solicit Personal Information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. You should also independently assess the authenticity of any site which appears or claims that it is one of our Platforms (including those linked to through an email or social networking page). To reach the privacy policy for Toyota Financial Services, please click [here](https://www.toyotafinancial.com/pub/home/). To reach Toyota dealer sites, please click [here](https://www.toyota.com/dealers/).

The Platforms may make available chat rooms, forums, message boards, and news groups. Remember that any information that you disclose in these areas becomes public information and is not subject to the provisions of this Privacy Notice.

  

**10\. CONSENT TO PROCESSING AND TRANSFER OF INFORMATION.**

The Platforms are governed by and operated in, and in accordance with the laws of, the United States, and are intended for the enjoyment of residents of the United States. Toyota makes no representation that the Platforms are governed by or operated in accordance with the laws of any other nation. Given that we are an international business, our use of your information necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis. If you are located in the European Union, Canada or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect may be transferred to and processed in the United States. By using the Platforms, or providing us with any information, you (a) acknowledge that the Platforms are subject to the laws of the United States, (b) consent to the collection, processing, maintenance and transfer of such information in and to the United States and other applicable territories in which the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as or equivalent to those in the country where you reside and/or are a citizen, and (c) waive any claims that may arise under those laws.

  

**11\. CHANGES.**

We may update this Privacy Notice to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on our Platforms prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.

(b) Severability: If any provision of these Terms are unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision is deemed severable from these Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

(c) Applicable Law: These Terms and any disputes arising under or related to these Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of Texas, without reference to its conflict of law principles.

(d) Entire Agreement: These Terms constitute the entire, complete and exclusive agreement between you and us regarding the Sites and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings with respect to the subject matter of these Terms.

(e) Waiver: The remedies of Toyota set forth in these Terms shall be cumulative and not alternative, and the election of one remedy for a breach shall not preclude pursuit of other remedies. Any failure by us, at any time or from time to time, to enforce any of our rights under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right.

  

**18\. DISPUTES/ARBITRATION.**

PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY. IT INCLUDES AN AGREEMENT TO MANDATORY ARBITRATION, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU AGREE TO SUBMIT ANY DISPUTE RELATED TO YOUR USE OF ANY OF THE SITES TO BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN PROCEED IN COURT. THIS PROVISION ALSO INCLUDES A CLASS ACTION WAIVER, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU AGREE TO PROCEED WITH ANY DISPUTE INDIVIDUALLY AND NOT AS PART OF A CLASS ACTION. THIS AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A JURY WAIVER.

It is Toyota's goal that the Sites meet your expectations and that you are satisfied. However, there may be instances when you have a problem or dispute that needs special attention. In those instances, Toyota is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution that satisfies you; however, we can only do this if we know about and understand your issue. Therefore, for any problem or dispute that you may have with Toyota, you acknowledge and agree that you will first give Toyota an opportunity to resolve your problem or dispute. This includes you first sending a written description of your problem or dispute to Toyota Motor North America, c/o Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc., Toyota Customer Experience Center, P.O. Box 259001 – Web Services, Plano, TX 75025-9001. You then agree to negotiate with Toyota in good faith about your problem or dispute. This should lead to resolution, but if for some reason your problem or dispute is not resolved satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after Toyota's receipt of your written description of it, you agree to the further dispute resolution provisions below.

You agree that the sole and exclusive forum and remedy for any and all disputes and claims that cannot be resolved informally and that relate in any way to or arise out of your use of any of the Sites and these Terms shall be final and binding arbitration, except to the extent that you have in any manner infringed upon or violated or threatened to infringe upon or violate any of the Toyota Entities' or any third party patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, privacy or publicity rights, in which case you acknowledge that there is no adequate remedy at law and that injunctive or other appropriate relief may be sought by the Toyota Entities and/or the applicable third party(ies) either in court or from an arbitrator. You and we acknowledge that the Agreement affects interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to arbitrations under the Agreement (despite any other choice of law provision). To the extent that the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law do not supply substantive law necessary for the resolution of any disputes or claims, the laws of the State of Texas shall apply, except that Texas laws concerning choice of law or conflict of laws shall not apply if they would cause the substantive law of another jurisdiction to apply. To the extent that the parties litigate any part of any dispute or claim in court, including, without limitation, obtaining provisional remedies in aid of arbitration, confirmation of the award, and judgment enforcement, the laws of the State of Texas shall apply, except that Texas laws concerning choice of law or conflict of laws shall not apply if they would cause the substantive law of another jurisdiction to apply.

Arbitration under this Agreement shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). The arbitration shall be administered by AAA pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules. If the arbitration results in an award, then judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. **You and we agree to pay our own fees, costs, and expenses, including those for any attorneys, experts, and witnesses.** You agree that any claim for or award of attorneys' fees, including such claim or award pursuant of Chapter 38 of Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, is waived. An arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief. As a limited exception to the agreement to arbitrate, you and we agree that you may take claims to small claims court, if your claims qualify for hearing by such court.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, NO ARBITRATION OR OTHER CLAIM UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE JOINED TO ANY OTHER ARBITRATION OR CLAIM, INCLUDING ANY ARBITRATION OR CLAIM INVOLVING ANY OTHER CURRENT OR FORMER VISITOR OF THE SITES, AND NO CLASS ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS SHALL BE PERMITTED. In the event that this **CLASS ACTION WAIVER** is deemed unenforceable, then any putative class action may only proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration.

WE BOTH AGREE THAT, WHETHER ANY CLAIM IS IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT, YOU AND TOYOTA BOTH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL INVOLVING ANY CLAIMS OR DISPUTES BETWEEN US.  
In no event shall any claim, action or proceeding by you related in any way to this Agreement be instituted more than two (2) years after the cause of action arose.

  

**19\. CONTACT US.**

If you have any questions, complaints or claims about any of the Sites, or if you are having any technical difficulties with any of the Sites, please email us through [https://www.toyota.com/support/#!/app/ask](https://www.toyota.com/support/#!/app/ask) or call us at 800-331-4331.

**A. RIGHT TO KNOW ABOUT AND ACCESS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

If you are a California consumer, you may have the right to request that Toyota provide you with information regarding what personal information about you we have collected, used, disclosed or sold in the preceding twelve (12) months. Once we receive your request and verify your identity, we will disclose to you the following:

Once we receive your request and verify your identity, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information in our records that is not subject to any of the CCPA exceptions. Specifically, we may deny your deletion request if your personal information is required for any of the following reasons, which we will identify in our response to you if we deny your request:

1.  Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.

3.  Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.

Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.
8.  Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with your expectations based on your relationship with us.
9.  Comply with a legal obligation.
10.  Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.

**C. RIGHT TO OPT-OUT OF THE SALE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

If you are a California consumer, you may have the right to request that Toyota stop selling certain or all of your personal information. Once we receive your request and verify your identity, we will process your request as soon as feasibly possible and will also provide notification of your request to any third parties to whom we sold your personal information in the ninety (90) days prior to your request. You may also use an authorized agent to submit a request to opt-out on your behalf, as long as you provide the authorized agent with written permission to do so and the agent provides such proof to us when they submit your request. If you opt-out and subsequently enter into any transactions where a sale of your personal information is required as a condition of completing the transaction, we will provide you with instructions on how you may opt back in. In addition, your opt-out will not affect any situations where you direct us to transfer your personal information to a third party.

**D. RIGHT TO NON-DISCRIMINATION**

Toyota will not discriminate against any California consumer who exercises any of the rights described above. Specifically, we will not deny you goods or services; charge you different prices or rates, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties; provide you with a different level of service or quality of goods or services; or suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.

**E. HOW TO SUBMIT A REQUEST**

If you are a California consumer and would like to exercise any of the CCPA rights identified above, you may submit a request by either completing the online request form at [https://privacy.toyota.com/](https://privacy.toyota.com/) or by calling us at 855-226-4048.

**F. SUBMITTING A REQUEST THROUGH YOUR AUTHORIZED AGENT**

If you are a California consumer, you may have the option to designate an authorized agent to submit a request on your behalf, so long the authorized agent has your written permission to do so and you have taken steps to verify your identity directly with us. If you would like to designate an agent, your agent must register as such with the California Secretary of State and submit a copy of this registration along with your consumer request to us. We may need to contact you directly to verify the request.

**G. HOW WE VERIFY YOUR REQUEST**

We cannot fulfill your request or provide you with your personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.

To verify your identity, we will ask that you provide the following personal information when you submit your request:

*   First Name
*   Last Name
*   Email Address
*   Mobile Phone Number
*   Address
*   City
*   State
*   Zip Code

You may need to provide additional information as part of your responses to our identity verification questions. We will only use this information to confirm your identity which may include the use of a third-party identity verification service. In the event we use a third-party identity verification service, our third-party identification verification tool will ask you certain identity verification questions and match those answers with what it has in its database. Depending on your type of request or the information requested by you, we may require additional information in order to verify your identity and fulfill your request.

If we cannot successfully verify your identity, we will inform you of that fact.

We will respond to your request within forty-five (45) days. However, in certain circumstances, we may require additional time to process your request, as permitted by the CCPA or other applicable law. We will advise you within forty-five (45) days after receiving your request if such an extension is necessary and why it is needed. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your verifiable consumer request.

If we cannot fulfill your request, our response to you will also explain the reason why we cannot fulfill your request.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

You may only make a verifiable consumer request to know about or access your personal information twice within a 12-month period.
