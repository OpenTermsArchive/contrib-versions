**2. HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION.**

We may collect Personal Information about you in a variety of ways, depending on your interaction with us or certain other parties. We may also supplement the information we collect about you directly and through our Platforms with information that we receive from other parties.

* **Directly from You**: We may collect Personal Information directly from you. This may happen in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when you use the Platforms, when you use or subscribe to services that we offer (such as Connected Services), when you use applications that we offer (such as the Toyota App), when you purchase a vehicle, and when you interact with Toyota’s Brand Engagement Center. We may also collect Personal Information from you when you submit comments to us or participate in programs. You may also provide us with written, audio or video feedback or testimonials that contain Personal Information.
* **Publicly Available Sources**: We may collect Personal Information from publicly available sources. For example, Toyota utilizes third-party social media management services to collect and analyze publicly available information on various social media sites.
* **From Other Individuals**: We may also collect Personal Information from other individuals. For example, some features on the Platforms may permit users to submit information about other people. If you wish to invite your friends to participate in a program offered through the Platforms or forward particular content from the Platforms to your friends, you will be asked to submit your friends' email addresses. Our use, sharing and protection of the other person's information will also be subject to the terms of the applicable program and this Privacy Notice.
* **From Other Parties**: We may also collect Personal Information from other parties, including our affiliates (such as Toyota Financial Services and Toyota Motor Corporation), our business partners, our service providers, and certain other-party companies (such as our authorized dealers, distributors, local dealer associations, data brokers and other data providers). Information from such other parties may have been collected online, offline, or through publicly or commercially available sources. In addition, we may collect information from other parties in the ways described below:
* _Requests to Other Parties._ Other parties may provide your information to us at your request. For example, if you are on another website and you opt in to receive information from Toyota, that website will submit to us your email address and other information about you so that we may contact you as requested.
* _Applications and Websites; Social Media._ You may also choose to participate in another party’s application or feature (such as one of our Facebook or X applications or a similar application or feature on another party’s website) or use another party’s website where you allow us to collect (or the other party to collect and share) information about you, including online activity data and other Personal Information, such as lists of your friends, "likes," comments you have shared, groups, location, and your activity on the other party's website. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on our Platforms to your profile page to share with others within your network. In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of another party’s website give us access to their profiles and you are one of their "connections" or information about you is otherwise accessible through your "connections" web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third-party website or interactive service.
* **Automatically From Your Devices**:  We may also collect the following types of Online Activity Data automatically when you use the Platforms:
* _Usage Information._ Whenever you visit or interact with the Platforms, we, as well as any other-party advertisers and/or service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the Platforms are accessed and used ("Usage Information"). Usage Information may include browser type, device type, operating system, application version, the page served, the time, the preceding page views, and your use of features or applications on the Platforms, such as interactions with friends and group activities.

* _Device Identifier._ We automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier") for the "Device" (computer, mobile phone, tablet or other device) you use to access the Platforms. A Device Identifier is a number that is assigned to your Device when you access a website or its servers, and our computers identify your device by its Device Identifier. We, and our affiliates, service providers, business partners, and other parties, including authorized dealers, may use a Device Identifier to, among other things, administer the Platforms; help diagnose problems with our servers; analyze trends; track users' web page movements over time and across different websites, Platforms, or other mobile, online, or offline services; to help identify you and your shopping cart, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
* _Cookies; Pixel Tags._ The technologies used on the Platforms to collect Usage Information, including Device Identifiers, include but are not limited to: cookies (data files placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Platforms), mobile analytics software and pixel tags (transparent graphic images, sometimes called web beacons or tracking beacons, placed on a web page or in an email, which indicates that a page or email has been viewed). Cookies may also be used to associate you with social networking sites like Facebook and X and, by using one of their applications either on or otherwise connected to our Platforms (e.g., social media login credentials or vehicle configuration shared to social media), you may enable interaction between your activities on the Platforms and your activities on such social networking sites. We, or our vendors, may place cookies or similar files on your Device for security purposes, to facilitate site navigation and to personalize your experience while visiting our Platforms (such as allowing us to select which ads or offers are most likely to appeal to you, based on your interests, preferences, location or demographic information). To customize your cookie settings for Toyota.com, visit Toyota.com and click on "Cookie Consent Options".

You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser. However, please be aware that some features of the website may not function properly or may be slower if you refuse cookies. In addition, the offers we provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests. If you block or delete cookies, not all tracking that we have described in this Privacy Notice will stop.

We may share non-Personal Information, such as aggregate data, and Usage Information with other parties. We may also share your information as disclosed at the time you provide your information, as set forth in this Privacy Notice and in the following circumstances:

Your Personal Information may also be used by us or shared with our subsidiaries, affiliates, sponsors, partners, advertisers or other parties to provide you with product information and promotional and other offers.

**Program Partners.** If you choose to participate in a Program, your Personal Information may also be disclosed to our Program partners and may be used by our Program partners in accordance with their own privacy notices. This Privacy Notice will not apply to that company's use of your information. Sometimes the rules, terms and conditions or disclaimers that apply to a particular Program (“Program Rules”) include additional information on how we may use the Personal Information that you provide to us through your participation in the Program. If there is a conflict between the Program Rules for a particular Program and this Privacy Notice, those applying to the particular Program will govern. Please review all of the information about a Program before you provide us with any Personal Information.

**Our Affiliates and Parent Company**: We may disclose your Personal Information with our affiliates, including but not limited to Toyota Financial Services, and our parent company, Toyota Motor Corporation.

**5\. CHOICE, ACCESS, AND RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.**

We provide you with choices with respect to your Personal Information. If you choose to receive e-mails from us about products and other information, we strive to keep your Personal Information updated and accurate and provide you choices regarding the e-mail communications you receive from us.

If you provided Toyota with Personal Information through the Owners section of toyota.com, you may review and update that information by clicking on the Owners link on the homepage of toyota.com, registering or logging in and then clicking on "Update Profile." If you have signed up for the Toyota marketing e-mail list, you can access the Preferences page and change your user profile or unsubscribe from the Toyota e-mail list [here](https://www.toyota.com/preferences?source=TOYOTA-COM&brand=Toyota) or by clicking the “unsubscribe” link on any Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., email you have received.

For users who are not currently registered on our owner site, please call the Toyota Brand Engagement Center at [800-331-4331](tel:800-331-4331) to opt out from receiving e-mail communications from Toyota. If you receive an e-mail, you may opt out at any time by following the opt out instructions provided in the e-mail you receive. Your opt out request will be processed within 10 days of the date on which we receive it.

If you are participating in a Program, you may be able to access and update the information you provided as part of your participation in the Program. Please see the section of the Platforms concerning the specific Program to determine if you are able to access your information and how to do so.

In accordance with our routine record keeping, we may delete certain records that contain Personal Information you have submitted through the Platforms. We are under no obligation to store such Personal Information indefinitely and disclaim any liability arising out of, or related to, the destruction of such Personal Information. It may not always be possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases without some residual data because of backups and other reasons. We will retain your information (including geo-location data) for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We do not control certain privacy settings and preferences maintained by our social media partners like Facebook and X. If you wish to make changes to those settings and preferences, you may do so by visiting the settings page of the appropriate social media site.

**6\. ADVERTISING/BEHAVIORAL TARGETING; HOW TO OPT OUT.**

We may use third-party ad network providers to help present ads on the Platforms, as well as other service providers to evaluate and provide us with information about the use of the Platforms and viewing of our content. Such providers may place and access cookies, pixel tags, or similar technologies on your Device to serve you ads or other content personalized to your interests which they infer from your location and/or your browsing on the Platforms and other sites you have visited. In doing so, the provider collects or has access to your Usage Information. The use of cookies, pixel tags, or similar technologies by these providers is also subject to their own privacy notices.

Certain web browsers may provide an option by which you may request your browser to inform websites you visit that you do not wish your activities to be tracked by cookies or other persistent identifiers, commonly called “Do Not Track Signals.” Although the websites we own and operate, including but not limited to Toyota.com, currently do not respond to Do Not Track Signals, you may choose to opt out of our use of targeting and advertising cookies on Toyota.com by visiting Toyota.com and clicking on “Cookie Consent Options.” You may also choose to block cookies with your browser. Please note that opting out of the use of such cookies on Toyota.com will not impact the use of third-party cookies by other websites, which we do not control. In addition, even if you choose to opt out of targeted advertising, you will still see advertisements while you're browsing online. However, the advertisements you see may be less relevant to you and your interests.

**7\. CHILDREN.**

The Platforms are not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect, use or disclose personally identifiable information from anyone under 13 years of age. If we determine upon collection that a user is under this age, we will not use or maintain his/her Personal Information without the parent/guardian's consent. If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13, we will make reasonable efforts to delete such information from our records.

**8\. SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION AND PHISHING SCAMS.**

We take information security seriously and use certain reasonable security measures to help protect your Personal Information. However, no electronic data transmission or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please note that we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you use the Platforms and provide us with your information at your own risk. When we collect sensitive information on our sites or within our mobile application (such as credit card number or geo-location information), we encrypt the transmission of that information using Secure Sockets Layer technology.

_Beware of Phishing Scams:_ There have been noticeable increases in the number of suspicious e-mails claiming that the e-mail recipient has won a Toyota lottery or other promotion. Sometimes the e-mail claims that the recipient has won a new Toyota Prius. In order to claim the prize, the e-mail asks that Personal Information be sent to a Gmail or Yahoo e-mail address.

This type of e-mail solicitation is known commonly as a "phishing" scam, with the primary objective being to obtain one's Personal Information. This information can then be utilized to steal a person's identity. For example, a "Toyota Lottery" phishing scam is often sent from Chinese (.cn), German (.de) or British (.co.uk) addresses but can originate from anywhere and look very official even to the most savvy of Internet users. Toyota will never ask you to send passwords, login names, Social Security numbers, or other Personal Information through e-mail or U.S. mail or fax or text message. If you receive an email or letter by U.S. mail or fax or text message from Toyota asking you to update your credit card information, do not respond: this is a phishing scam. Recipients of suspicious e-mail like this should delete the message from their in-box and, if possible, update their e-mail filter settings to block e-mails from the e-mail address being used. The [Federal Trade Commission](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2008/04/new-ftc-videos-help-consumers-spot-phishing-scams) and the [Antiphishing Workgroup](https://www.antiphishing.org/) are also good sources of information about these types of security threats and how they may be reported to the authorities.

**9\. OTHER SITES.**

The Platforms may contain links to other sites that we do not own or operate, such as the site for Toyota Financial Services and to sites for Toyota dealers, as well as links from advertisers, sponsors and/or partners. We do not control, recommend or endorse and are not responsible for these sites or their content, products, services or privacy notices or practices, even though they may use the Toyota name or logo on their site through an agreement with us. These other sites may send their own cookies to your Device, they may independently collect data or solicit Personal Information and may or may not have their own published privacy notices. You should also independently assess the authenticity of any site which appears or claims that it is one of our Platforms (including those linked to through an email or social networking page). 

The Platforms may make available chat rooms, forums, message boards, and news groups. Remember that any information that you disclose in these areas becomes public information and is not subject to the provisions of this Privacy Notice.

**10\. CONSENT TO PROCESSING AND TRANSFER OF INFORMATION.**

The Platforms are governed by and operated in, and in accordance with the laws of, the United States, and are intended for the enjoyment of residents of the United States. Toyota makes no representation that the Platforms are governed by or operated in accordance with the laws of any other nation. Given that we are an international business, our use of your information necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis. If you are located in the European Union, Canada or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect may be transferred to and processed in the United States. By using the Platforms, or providing us with any information, you (a) acknowledge that the Platforms are subject to the laws of the United States, (b) consent to the collection, processing, maintenance and transfer of such information in and to the United States and other applicable territories in which the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as or equivalent to those in the country where you reside and/or are a citizen, and (c) waive any claims that may arise under those laws.

**11\. CHANGES.**

We may update this Privacy Notice to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes, we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on our Platforms prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.

**12\. DISCLOSURES FOR INDIVIDUALS IN THE UNITED STATES.**

Privacy laws in the United States give consumers certain privacy rights related to their Personal Information. This section contains additional information for residents in the United States regarding our Personal Information handling practices and data privacy rights.

**Summary of Personal Information Handling Practices**

Toyota may collect Personal Information from you in different ways and for different purposes.

**Authorized Agent/Power of Attorney/Conservatorship/Guardianship.**

Where permitted by state law, you may exercise privacy rights through an authorized agent, power of attorney, conservatorship, or guardianship.

If we receive your request through an authorized agent with written authority, we will request evidence you provided such agent with valid written authority to submit privacy rights requests on your behalf.

For anything other than a power of attorney, conservatorship, or guardianship, please complete, sign, and provide your authorized agent with the “_TMNA Authorized Agent Designation_” document that can be found [here](https://privacy.toyota.com/assets/files/AA_Designation_Document.pdf). Certain privacy rights requests may require you to complete the identity verification process.

* Selecting the requestor’s state of residency

**How We Verify Your Request**

Except for rights related to sharing for targeted advertising or sale or if a certain privacy law does not permit verification (unless we need information to complete your request or find you in our systems), we cannot fulfill your request or provide you with your Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. Please also note that, as mentioned above, we use your “sensitive" Personal Information with your consent or for certain permitted purposes. As such, we will not verify your identity if you contact us to request to limit the use and disclosure of your "sensitive" Personal Information because we use such data only for the limited purposes noted above. However, we may request your information to answer any questions you have related to "sensitive" Personal Information.

To verify your identity, we will ask that you provide the following Personal Information when you submit your request:

* First name
* Last name
* Email address
* Mobile phone number
* Address
* City
* State
* Zip Code

You may need to provide additional information as part of your responses to our identity verification questions. We will only use this information to confirm your identity which may include the use of a third-party identity verification service. In the event we use a third-party identity verification service, our third-party identification verification tool will ask you certain identity verification questions and match those answers with what it has in its database. Depending on your type of request or the information requested by you, we may require additional information in order to verify your identity and fulfill your request. If we cannot successfully verify your identity, we will inform you of that fact.

Except for rights related to sharing for targeted advertising or sale, which we will honor within fifteen (15) business days, we will respond to your request within forty-five (45) calendar days. However, in certain circumstances, we may require additional time to process your request, as permitted by applicable law. We will advise you within forty-five (45) calendar days after receiving your request if such an extension is necessary and why it is needed. If we cannot fulfill your request, our response to you will also explain the reason why we cannot fulfill your request.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

You may only make a verifiable consumer request to know about or access your Personal Information twice within a 12-month period.
