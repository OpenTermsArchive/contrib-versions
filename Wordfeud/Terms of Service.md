### 2\. Rights to Use the Service

Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Bertheussen IT grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use and access the Service, solely for your personal, non-commercial use.

### 3\. Intellectual Property/Ownership

All rights, title and interest in and to all materials that are part of the Service (including, but not limited to, designs, text, graphics, pictures, video, information, applications, software, music, sound and other files, and their selection and arrangement), except for “User Content” (as defined below), collectively referred to as the “Service Materials”, are, as between Bertheussen IT and you, owned by Bertheussen IT and/or its third party licensors. You acknowledge and agree that you shall not acquire any ownership rights whatsoever by downloading Service Materials.

### 4\. User Content

Any data, text, graphics, photographs and their selection and arrangement, and any other materials uploaded to the Service by you or other users (hereinafter "User Content") are subject, whether in whole or in part, to unlimited commercial, non-commercial and/or promotional use by Bertheussen IT. All User Content is the sole responsibility of the person from whom the User Content originated. Thus, users are responsible, and Bertheussen IT is not responsible for any files users upload, post, or otherwise make available. Bertheussen IT may or may not regulate User Content and does not guarantee the accuracy, quality, or integrity of any User Content posted via the Bertheussen IT application. By using Bertheussen IT you acknowledge and accept that you may be exposed to material you find offensive or objectionable.

You represent and warrant that User Content you transmit or submit is original to you and that you exclusively own the rights to such content, including the right to grant all of the rights and licenses in these Terms without Bertheussen IT incurring any third party obligations or liability arising out of its exercise of such rights and licenses.

You hereby grant to Bertheussen IT a worldwide, irrevocable (as long as your account is not terminated), perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, fully paid-up and royalty-free license, (with the right to sublicense), to use, copy, adapt, modify, distribute, license, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, stream, broadcast and otherwise exploit User Content you transmit or submit and all derivative works. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, you hereby waive any moral rights you may have in User Content.

The foregoing license granted Bertheussen IT by you, expires in the event that your account is terminated, either by you, or by Bertheussen IT.

Bertheussen IT reserves the right to remove and permanently delete any User Content from the Service with or without notice for any reason or no reason. You may notify Bertheussen IT of any User Content that you believe violates these Terms, or other inappropriate user behavior, by emailing [support@wordfeud.com](mailto:support@wordfeud.com).
