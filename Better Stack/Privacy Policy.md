How we share your personal data
-------------------------------

We only share your PII within Better Stack and with those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that need to know the information in order to process it on Better Stack’s behalf or to provide the Services and those that that have agreed not to disclose it to others.

We do not share your PII with other recipients unless one of the following circumstances applies:

**It is necessary for the compliance with our obligations towards you.** To the extent that our external service providers (sub-processors) need access to your PII to help us perform our Services for you, we have taken the appropriate contractual and organizational measures to ensure that your PII are processed in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.

A full list of our sub-processors is found in our [DPA](https://betterstack.com/dpa).

The list of external service providers we use may change from time to time as we change or remove some of the providers listed above and/or put in place other providers to assist us in providing the Services.

**It is necessary for legal reasons.** We may share your PII with recipients outside of Better Stack if we have a good-faith belief that access to and use of your PII is reasonably necessary to: (i) meet any applicable law, regulation, and/or court order; (ii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; and/or (iii) protect the interests, properties or safety of Better Stack, our users or the public as far as in accordance with the law. When possible, we will inform you about such processing.

Where do we transfer your data to
---------------------------------

We process personal data primarily in the European Union. However, our Services are governed by and operated in, and in accordance with the laws of the United States and are intended for the enjoyment of residents of the United States.

If you use our Services and are a European resident, you acknowledge and agree that your PII may be transmitted outside of the European Economic Area. In such a case, we transfer your personal data only to a country that is considered to have an adequate level of protection in accordance with the EU Commission's decision or there are appropriate safeguards in place to protect your personal data, such as standard contractual clauses or binding internal company rules. Regardless of the country in which your personal data is processed, we take reasonable technical, legal and organizational measures to ensure that the level of protection is the same as in the European Union and the European Economic Area.

If we are involved in a merger, acquisition or other reorganization, your information may be transferred as part of that deal. We will notify you (for example, via a message to the email address associated with your account) of any such deal and outline your choices in that event.

What is the storage period
--------------------------

Better Stack stores your PII only if it is legally permitted and necessary for the purposes for which the data were collected or we are legally obliged to do so.

Better Stack as a Data Processor
--------------------------------

While using our Services, you may be providing us with your clients’ data, including PII such as name and email address. You are the controller or primary processor with regard to the processing of relevant PII. Better Stack shall process PII only as a processor or sub-processor (as applicable to your use of the Services).

More information regarding our data processing as a processor can be found in our [Data Processing Agreement](https://betterstack.com/dpa).

California Consumer Privacy Act Notice
--------------------------------------

If you are a California resident, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you to request information regarding the disclosure of your PII to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Moreover, you have the right to restrict the sharing of your PII and with our affiliates (companies we own or control) and outside companies with whom we do business.

We are aware of your rights afforded to California residents under the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”). Even though the CCPA does not apply to us now, we are ready to protect your PII and give you an option to exercise your right under CCPA once it becomes applicable.

To contact us with questions about our rights under California privacy laws, email us at hello@betterstack.com.

**Right of access.** Better Stack offers you access to your PII we process. This means you can contact us and request from us a confirmation whether or not your PII are being processed and if so, you have the right to request access to your data, which we will provide to you in the form of a so-called "registry" (stating, in particular, purposes, categories of personal data, categories of recipients of personal data, storage periods or criteria for determining storage periods).

**Right to erasure.** You may also ask us to erase your PII from our systems. We will comply with such requests unless we have a legitimate ground to not delete your personal data.

**Right to restriction of processing.** You may request us to restrict certain processing of your personal data. If you restrict certain processing of your personal data, this may lead to fewer possibilities to use our Services and Site.
