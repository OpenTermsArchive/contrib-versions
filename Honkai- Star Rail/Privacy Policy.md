**Please be aware that advertisers or websites with links to and/or from our websites may collect personal data about you. This Privacy Policy does not apply to such third party services, and cannot control the activities of, those other advertisers or websites. We highly recommend that you read the privacy policy of such third-party websites which you may be directed to before providing any personal data.**

**10\. CHILDREN’S PROTECTION**

We are designing our services to be welcoming to users of all ages around the world. This means that we collect age information from users, and some of our services will provide a different experience based on what we know about the age of a user and where they live. The information below is for parents and guardians to understand our privacy practices with respect to children (under 13 or the age of consent under local laws, whichever is higher).

**(1) Countries where we operate an Age-Gate**

In certain countries, such as the United States, we may be required by law to operate an age-gate, where, when a user indicates that they are a child, we do not collect or process their personal data until they are no longer a child as defined above or until their parent or guardian provides consent and/or enables access to particular features. In these circumstances, the personal data we collect may include:

· Date of birth and country to determine age and apply appropriate settings

· Parent or guardian email address to provide notice and seek consent (which is deleted if the parent does not respond within 14 days)

· Persistent identifiers like IP address, UIDs, necessary website tracking technologies, and device identifiers in order to provide and maintain our services (including analytics to improve them), protect the security and integrity of users and ensure legal and regulatory compliance.

For clarity, the data indicated above (including persistent identifiers) will be collected and processed prior to obtaining parent or guardian consent, for the purposes stated and to support internal operations, for example, to trigger the age-gate and other internal operational purposes.

**Notice, Consent, and Parental Controls**

We collect a parent or guardian email address from a child player to send the parent or guardian an email notice that the child has initiated account creation, and informs them about how verifiable parental consent works. This notice also lets them review our privacy practices, provide consent for their child to create an account, and set up parental controls. Please note that parents/guardians must complete our parent verification process to provide consent for a child to set up an account.

We use Kids Web Services (KWS), for parent/guardian verification and user age verification purposes. KWS will remember that you have verified your age the next time you use your email address to access other games/services powered by KWS technology, so you won’t need to verify again. We and KWS are separate independent controllers for personal information sent to us. For example, we collect a parent or guardian’s email address and transfer it to KWS as an independent controller. However, once the parent or guardian is re-directed to the KWS environment, KWS is an independent controller for the processing activities that follows. Such processing activities include checking the email against the KWS AgeGraph, collecting verification information from the parents or guardians, hashing the email and adding it into the AgeGraph, sending the user the verification confirmation, and notifying the parent or guardian of successful verification. With regard to the data shared by KWS with us following a successful verification, such as the parent’s email and their verified status, we are the independent controller. For more information, you can learn more about KWS in the KWS[Privacy Policy](https://www.kidswebservices.com/en-US/privacy-policy).

When a parent or guardian gives permission for a child to set up an account, parental controls are enabled automatically. Parental controls can then be accessed using a PIN code, let you change choices about particular features made during the permission flow, and further customize your child’s experience. You can learn more about our parental controls [here](https://account.hoyoverse.com/passport/index.html#/parental-control/verify).

Once a parent has authorized an account for their child, the privacy practices described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy generally apply, but child users may not have access to all content or features (because of our parental controls in place). Depending on the parental control settings, the child player may be restricted in terms of payment access and community access such as social features and content sharing, among other features.

A parent may revoke consent to the collection of their child’s data at any time by contacting us using the contact details under “Contact Us” below. If a parent does not consent or later revokes consent, we will delete the child’s account and its associated information within 14 days of the response or revocation of consent.  If a parent does not respond to this request for consent within the prescribed period, we will delete the parent and the child’s data (including their HoYoverse account), if they already have one, within 14 days of the initial request.

For the avoidance of doubt, in certain countries such as the United States, we are required to delete accounts of children under the age of 13 unless a parent or guardian provides verifiable consent, and any child’s data or account that is deleted as a result of the foregoing is permanent, irrecoverable, and cannot be restored notwithstanding that the child subsequently reaches the age of 13. For other countries where the legally applicable age is higher, the higher age will apply. 

**Child and Parent Privacy Rights**

Child users and their parents/guardians can exercise their individual privacy rights as described in Section 8 above and Section 13 below. Parental controls enable parents and guardians to change the choices made about their child’s use of particular features like community access. Parents/Guardians can also review the child’s personal information held by us and delete their child’s account (which deletes the personal information and stops further collection). To exercise these rights, please see the “Contact Us” section below

**(2) Countries where we do not operate an Age-Gate**

In countries where we do not operate an age-gate, under certain laws, users under the age of 13 (or other age thresholds as stipulated under local laws) may not be allowed to use our services or require parental or guardian consent. If you are 13 and above but are considered a minor in your country, under certain laws, you must have your parent or legal guardian read through this Privacy Policy with you and you represent that you have obtained the permission or consent of your parent or guardian to use our services.

**Information to Parents and Legal Guardians**

If you are a parent or legal guardian of a minor in a country where we do not operate an age-gate, please make sure that you have read this Privacy Policy before allowing your children to create their own accounts or to use our services. You agree that you will be subject to this Privacy Policy and be responsible for your children’s activities while using our services. You agree to supervise your children’s use of our services and make sure that your children only view the contents that are age appropriate to your children.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, we recognize that we have a special obligation to protect children in regard to the collection and processing of personal data. We strongly urge parents and guardians to instruct their children never to disclose or give out their personal data when using our services without the prior permission of their parent or guardian. If you are a parent or guardian and have any concern regarding your child’s use of our services, please contact us using the contact details under “Contact Us” below.

**Your Rights and Choices**

If you submit a request to us and you receive a response from us informing you that we have declined your request, in whole or in part, where provided by applicable law, you may appeal that decision by submitting your appeal using the contact method described in Section 12 of this Privacy Policy.

_Right to Opt-out of Targeted Advertising and Data “Sales”_

Some privacy laws define “sale” broadly to include some of the data disclosures described in Section 6 above – in particular certain sharing with third party providers for targeted advertising purposes. To opt-out from targeted advertising and any related data “sales,” you have several options.

You can use browser or device-level controls as follows:

· **Cookie controls**. Please see our [Cookie Policy](https://www.hoyoverse.com/en-us/legal/cookies) ([https://www.hoyoverse.com/en-us/legal/cookies](https://www.hoyoverse.com/en-us/legal/cookies)) for details on how you can control cookies. Note that if you choose to refuse or delete cookies, this could affect certain features, settings and preferences controlled by those cookies including advertising preferences which may be deleted and may need to be recreated.

· **Do Not Track**. Some browsers include a "Do Not Track" (DNT) setting that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. O_ur websites do not respond to browser DNT signals_. Instead, you can use the range of other tools to control data collection and use, including the advertising controls described above.

· **Mobile advertising ID controls**. iOS and Android operating systems provide options to limit tracking and/or reset the advertising IDs.

· **Email web beacon controls**. Most email clients have settings that allow you to prevent the automatic downloading of images, including web beacons, and the automatic connection to the web servers that host those images

These choices are specific to the device or browser you are using. If you access our services from other devices or browsers, take these actions from those devices or browsers to ensure your choices apply to the data collected when you use them.

**_(b) Additional terms for California Residents_**

**California Consumer Privacy Act.** The CCPA requires us to provide our users who reside in California with the additional notice below. For the purposes of this notice, Personal Information means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household, or as otherwise defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (California Civil Code §§ 1798.100 to 1798.199) and its implementing regulations, as amended or superseded from time to time (“CCPA”).

Personal Information does not include information that is:

· Lawfully made available from government records.

· Deidentified or aggregated.

· Otherwise excluded from the scope of the CCPA.

We collect and disclose the categories of personal information as set out in Section 13(1)(a) above, for the business purposes also set out in Section 13(1)(a).

If you are a California resident, and the processing of personal information about you is subject to the CCPA, you have certain rights with respect to that information:

· Notice at Collection. At or before the time of collection, you have a right to receive notice of our practices, including the categories of personal information and sensitive personal information to be collected \[Section 1\], the purposes for which such information is collected or used \[Section 2\], whether such information is sold or shared, and how long such information is retained \[Section 7\]. You can find those details in this Privacy Policy by referring to this and the above-referenced sections.

· Right to Know. The right to request a copy of the personal information that we have collected about you in the prior 12 months. You also have a right to request additional information about our collection, use, disclosure, or sale of such personal information. Note that we have provided much of this information in this Privacy Policy. You may make such a “request to know” as described in Section 8(1) of this Privacy Policy.

· Rights to Request Correction or Deletion. You also have rights to request that we correct inaccurate personal information and that we delete personal information under certain circumstances, subject to a number of exceptions. To make a request to correct or delete, please do so using our game/non-game account information functionality or email us using the contact information in Section 12 of this Privacy Policy.

· Right to Opt-Out / “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information”. You have a right to opt-out from future “sales” or “sharing” of personal information as those terms are defined by the CCPA.

Note that the CCPA defines “sell,” “share,” and “personal information” very broadly, and some of our data disclosures described in this Privacy Policy may be considered a “sale” or “sharing” under those definitions. In particular, we let advertising and analytics providers collect identifiers (IP addresses, cookie IDs, and mobile IDs), activity data (browsing, clicks, app usage), and device data through our sites and apps when you use our online services, but do not “sell” or “share” any other types of personal information. If you do not wish for us or our partners to “sell” or “share” personal information relating to your visits to our sites for advertising purposes, you can make your request by emailing us using the contact information in Section 12 of this Privacy Policy. If you opt-out using these choices, we will not disclose or make available such personal information in ways that are considered a “sale” or “sharing” under the CCPA. However, we will continue to make available to our partners (acting as our service providers) some personal information to help us perform advertising-related functions. Further, using these choices will not opt you out of the use of previously “sold” or “shared” personal information or stop all interest-based advertising.

We do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age.

· Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information. You have a right to limit our use of sensitive personal information for any purposes other than to provide the services or goods you request or as otherwise permitted by law. Note that we do not use sensitive personal information for any such additional purposes.

You may designate, in writing or through a power of attorney, an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights under the CCPA. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require the agent to provide proof you have authorized them to act on your behalf, and we may need you to verify your identity directly with us.

Further, to provide, correct, or delete specific pieces of personal information we will need to verify your identity to the degree of certainty required by law. We will verify your request through common market practices, including by asking you to send it from the email address associated with your account or requiring you to provide information necessary to verify your account.

You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment for the exercise of your CCPA privacy rights, subject to certain limitations.

Additionally, under California Civil Code section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine the Light” law, California residents who have provided personal information to a business with which the individual has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California Customers”) may request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.

Please be aware that we do not disclose personal information to any third parties for their direct marketing purposes as defined by this law.

California Customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by emailing the address provided in the "Contact Us" section above. Please note that businesses are required to respond to one request per California Customer each year and may not be required to respond to requests made by means other than through the designated email address.

California residents under the age of 18 who are registered users of online sites, services, or applications have a right under California Business and Professions Code section 22581 to remove, or request and obtain removal of, content or information they have publicly posted. To remove content or information you have publicly posted, or to request that we remove such content or information, please send us a detailed description of the specific content or information you wish to have removed using the details provided in the "Contact Us" section above. Please be aware that your request does not guarantee complete or comprehensive removal of content or information posted online and that the law may not permit or require removal in certain circumstances.

An authorized agent may submit an access or deletion request on your behalf by sending a written authorization signed by you using the contact information in the “Contact Us” section. We may still require you to directly verify your identity and confirm that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request

**(2)  Additional Information for the EEA and UK residents**

If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the United Kingdom (UK), the following additional information applies to you in addition to the Privacy Policy set out above.

**Data Subject Rights**

In addition to the information set out in the "Your rights and choices" section in the Privacy Policy above, you have the right to:

· ask us to restrict the processing of your personal data,

· data portability,

· to object to the processing of personal data.

**Legal basis for processing your personal data**

Our legal basis for collecting and using the information described in section 1 for the purposes in section 2 of our Privacy Policy above is:

· To establish and perform our contract with you (i.e. our Terms of Service) and to provide our services;

· For our or our partners’ legitimate interests, where those interests are not overridden by your data protection interests of fundamental rights and freedoms, e.g. to protect our legal rights, to pursue or defend legal claims, to improve our services;

· Consent, where obtained separately;

· For compliance with our legal obligations under applicable laws and regulations;

· To protect our or your vital interests or those of another person (for example, another player), e.g. against fraud and violations of our terms;

· While we typically do not collect sensitive or special category personal information, where we do this, it will be on the grounds of explicit consent or other applicable lawful basis.

Where we rely on a legitimate interest for the processing of your data, we have performed a legitimate interest assessment to determine whether your interests outweigh our interests in the processing taking place. You can obtain more information about this balancing test by using the contact details under ‘Contact Us’.

If you have questions, need further information about the legal bases for processing your personal information, or want to withdraw your consent, please see section 12 “Contact Us” in the Privacy Policy above.

**Cross-border data transfer**

As a global company, we may transfer your personal data to our affiliates, third party service providers and partners that operate around the world, which are located in countries other than the country in which you are resident (e.g. Singapore). These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country.

Where we transfer your personal information to countries and territories outside of the European Economic Area and the UK, which have been formally recognised as providing an adequate level of protection for personal information, we rely on the relevant “adequacy decisions” from the European Commission, where applicable.

Where the transfer is not subject to an adequacy decision, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The safeguards we use are the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses as issued on 4 June 2021, including the UK Addendum, and/or the UK International Data Transfer Agreement permitted under Article 46 of the UK GDPR. This is how transfers of personal information between us and other companies will be safeguarded. All companies are required to protect personal information that they process from Europe in accordance with European Union data protection law. Transferred personal information includes basic information such as your name or contact information such as your email address.

**Children's Notice**

Our services are not marketed to, or intended for, children. Children for the purposes of our services are (a) under the age of 13 years old or, if older (b) between 13 and 18 years old but under the age at which they can give valid digital consent to processing of their personal information under applicable data privacy laws. We strive to follow the different minimum age guidelines set by the laws of individual regions when determining the age that children can access certain features of our services.

Children are not permitted to use our services, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. Though our services are not intended for children as the primary audience, we may collect age information before allowing a user to proceed for certain services. If we learn that we have inadvertently gathered personal information about a child that is not subject to an exemption under applicable privacy law, we will take measures to promptly remove that information from our records.

**Data Protection Supervisory Authority**

To lodge a complaint with your national or regional data protection supervisory authority, please contact the competent authority.
