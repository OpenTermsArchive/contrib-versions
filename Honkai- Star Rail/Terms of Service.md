COGNOSPHERE Game(s) include but are not limited to the software of COGNOSPHERE Game(s) (including but not limited to the whole game software and any content, component, element or feature involved therein), any patches, updates, and upgrades to the application, any related content, documentation, add-ons, supplements, any game-related services made available to you by COGNOSPHERE under this Agreement, and/or any copy of the foregoing.

2\. HoYoverse Account
---------------------

a. You may be required to register or have a HoYoverse Account ("Account") in order to use the COGNOSPHERE Services.

To create an Account, you will be required to register as a User and accept the Account Terms of Service. If you do not accept those terms, you will not be able to create an Account.

b. You may establish an Account only if you are a natural person and an adult in your country of residence, and you are not an individual specifically prohibited by us or relevant laws from using the COGNOSPHERE Services.

When you have successfully created an Account, as a registered user ("User" or "Registered User"), you need to create a username ("Nickname") to be used during your game play. You acknowledge and agree not to use a Nickname which is obscene or otherwise offensive. We are entitled (but not obliged) to filter out certain words and phrases that we consider unacceptable. Besides, while any registration process that we adopt may filter out certain unacceptable words and phrases, it can never be a comprehensive filter. Also, we reserve the right to terminate your usership or Account and have the right to require your re-registration with a new acceptable Nickname if, in our discretion, we consider that your Nickname (or its use) is offensive or otherwise breaches the agreement terms in any way.

c. By creating an Account, you agree that you will:

(i) provide accurate, up-to-date and complete information about you whenever prompted or permitted by any site registration process ("Personal Data"); and

(ii) maintain and promptly update your Personal Data and keep your Personal Data accurate, up to date, and complete.

d. You acknowledge that to create an Account, you must be at least of the minimum age for consenting to Personal Data collection under the law in your jurisdiction and that you are an adult in your country of residence (or at other age in your jurisdiction where you are classified as above the legal age of majority) when using the COGNOSPHERE Services.

e. You agree to provide accurate and complete registration information, and you are not suggested to create a Nickname that reflects your real name or other Personal Data.

f. You shall be responsible for keeping your Account secure and confidential (including but not limited to email address, passwords or other related account information). Also, you acknowledge that you shall be responsible for any and all actions performed, using, or accessing the COGNOSPHERE Services through your Account, whether or not authorized by you.

g. Each Account is unique and important to each User. You shall not transfer, share, or otherwise make your Account information available to third parties, nor use other User(s)' Account(s) at any time. If you sell or otherwise transfer control over your Account or other related information, COGNOSPHERE reserves the right to take action, including but not limited to the right to terminate your Account immediately without any refund.

h. We may terminate your access to the COGNOSPHERE Services or Account at any time for any reason without any further formality if we have reason to believe that you have failed to comply with this Agreement. If your Account is so terminated, you will not be permitted to re-register as a User without our express permission. If you decide to terminate your access to the COGNOSPHERE Services or Account, please contact our support service, and we may terminate it as soon as reasonably practical after receiving your termination request.

i. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account information and if any third parties use your Account or otherwise access your Account, you may not claim compensation from COGNOSPHERE. In the event of theft, unauthorized use or any other security breach pertaining to your Account, it is your responsibility to notify COGNOSPHERE immediately.

15\. Modification

16\. Non-waiver
---------------

No failure or delay on the part of COGNOSPHERE in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver of it, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege preclude any other or further exercise of it or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

17\. Notice

-----------------

a. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be void or declared illegal, invalid or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever, then you and COGNOSPHERE agree that such provision will be severed and the rest of the Agreement shall remain in effect and be construed as if any severed provision had not been included. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Class Action Waiver set forth in Section 20(d) and Section 21(b) is found invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, you and COGNOSPHERE agree that it will not be severable; the entire Dispute Resolution provisions set forth in Sections 20 and 21 will be void and unenforceable and any dispute will be resolved in choice subject to the venue and choice of law clauses specified in this Agreement. In other words, under no circumstances shall arbitration be conducted on a class basis without the express prior written consent of COGNOSPHERE.

20\. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution (Rest of World)
-------------------------------------------------------

THIS SECTION APPLIES TO ALL CONSUMERS AND PERSONS WHO ACCEPTED THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, EXCLUDING CONSUMERS AND PERSONS WHO ARE RESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. **IF YOU ARE A USER RESIDING IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA PLEASE REFER TO SECTION 21.**

Please read this section carefully. It affects your rights, including your right to file a lawsuit in court.

a. **Governing Law.** This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of Singapore excluding its conflict of law principles.

b. **Binding Individual Arbitration.** You agree and acknowledge that any claims or legal actions between you and COGNOSPHERE shall be referred to Singapore International Arbitration Centre ("SIAC") for arbitration which shall be conducted in accordance with SIAC’s arbitration rules. The arbitral award is final and binding upon both parties. A sole arbitrator shall be selected pursuant to the Arbitration Rules of the SIAC. Unless otherwise agreed, the arbitration shall be conducted in a confidential manner. And the proceeding will be in English.

If the above arbitration terms are not enforceable on any dispute, both parties agree that such dispute shall be brought in a court in Singapore. You hereby consent to and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and/or forum _non conveniens_ with respect to venue and jurisdiction, whether by arbitration or judicial judgment.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights (an "Intellectual Property Action"), and each party reserves the right to bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to stop and/or seek compensation for the intentional or willful misuse or abuse (e.g. hacking or falsifying location) of their intellectual property.

c. **Informal Resolution.** You agree that in the event of any dispute, COGNOSPHERE and you shall first attempt to resolve any such dispute informally for a period no less than Sixty (60) calendar days before initiating arbitration proceedings. The informal dispute resolution process shall be deemed to have begun upon the receipt of written notice from one party to the other ("Written Notice of Dispute"). The Written Notice of Dispute must include the full name and contact information of the complainant, describe the nature and basis of the dispute, and set for the relief sought. The Written Notice of Dispute shall be sent to hsrcs\_en@hoyoverse.com.

In the event that any such dispute cannot be resolved informally, you agree that the dispute, including any question regarding the arbitrability of the dispute, shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with subsection (b) of this Section 20 above.

d. **Class Action Waiver.** You agree that each party may only bring claims against the other solely in their individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding in any jurisdiction. Furthermore, if the parties' dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person's claims with your claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then this clause 20(d) shall be null and void.

21\. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution (United States of America)
------------------------------------------------------------------

**THIS SECTION APPLIES TO ALL CONSUMERS AND PERSONS WHO ARE RESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.** 

a. **Governing Law.** If you live in the United States of America, you and COGNOSPHERE each agree that this Agreement including but not limited to any Dispute, controversy, difference, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the COGNOSPHERE Services, your use of the COGNOSPHERE Services, including the existence, validity, interpretation, performance, breach or termination thereof or any Dispute regarding non-contractual obligations arising out of or relating to this Agreement or COGNOSPHERE Services, the rights and responsibilities of the parties, and all other disputes between the parties, regardless of whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, and negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory, and shall be governed by, and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to or application of conflict of law.

b. **BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER AND REPRESENTATIVE-TYPE ACTION WAIVER. READ THIS SECTION 21 (b) CAREFULLY. IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT OR TO PURSUE CLAIMS IN A CLASS, GROUP OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR AS A THIRD PARTY. THESE BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER AND REPRESENTATION-TYPE WAIVER PROVISIONS APPLY TO YOU.**

**CLASS ACTION WAIVER AND REPRESENTATIVE-TYPE ACTION WAIVER.** YOU AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER SOLELY IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, NEITHER YOU NOR COGNOSPHERE SHALL BE ENTITLED TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY PAST, PENDING, OR FUTURE CLASS OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE-TYPE ACTIONS, TO CONSOLIDATE, JOIN OR COORDINATE DISPUTES BY OR AGAINST OTHER INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES, OR PARTICIPATE IN OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, INCLUDING AS A REPRESENTATIVE MEMBER OF A CLASS OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY, OR OTHERWISE SEEK TO RECOVER FOR LOSSES INCURRED BY A THIRD PARTY IN ANY ACTION PURSUANT TO ANY STATUTE THAT ALLOWS RECOVERY ON BEHALF OF, FOR THE BENEFIT OF, OR OF AMOUNTS LOST OR SPENT BY OTHER INDIVIDUALS IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISPUTE. YOU AND COGNOSPHERE ARE EACH EXPRESSLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVING SUCH RESPECTIVE RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY.  To the extent applicable law does not allow the waiver of certain claims, but permits those claims to be arbitrated, then such claims shall be resolved in arbitration. To the extent allowed by law, the arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity, including injunctive relief. **If this Class Action Waiver And Representative-Type Action Waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution Provision contained in Section 21 (b) shall be null and void.**

**AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE.**

(1) You and COGNOSPHERE, to the fullest extent allowed by law, agree to submit any and all Disputes (as defined below), to individual binding arbitration rather than in a court, in accordance with this provision. (2) For the purposes of this agreement, a “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and COGNOSPHERE regarding any aspect of your relationship with COGNOSPHERE, including those arising out of the use of the COGNOSPHERE Services, all marketing related to the COGNOSPHERE Services, enhancements, Virtual Currency, Virtual Goods, User Contributions, any licensed content, and all matters relating to or arising from this Agreement, COGNOSPHERE Privacy Policy, or any other agreement between you and Company, including any disputes over the validity, enforceability, or interpretation of this agreement to arbitrate. "Dispute" is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced. (3) All Disputes shall be subject to these BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION AND REPRESENTATION-TYPE WAIVER provisions regardless of whether the Dispute is based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, and negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory. This includes claims or requests for relief that accrued before we agreed to this Agreement. Subject to the exceptions below, you and we understand that there is no judge or jury in arbitration and that court review of an arbitration award is limited. The parties waive their rights to a jury trial and to have any Dispute resolved in court. (4) This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.) (“FAA”), including its procedural provisions, in all respects. State arbitration laws do not govern in any respect.

(i). **Informal Dispute Resolution.**

We agree that in the event of any Dispute, COGNOSPHERE and you shall first attempt to resolve any such Dispute informally for a period no less than sixty (60) calendar days before initiating arbitration proceedings (“Informal Dispute Resolution”).

The Informal Resolution Period is designed to allow the parties to make a fair, fact-based offer of settlement if it chooses to do so. You and COGNOSPHERE therefore agree that neither party will demand or attempt to commence arbitration or litigation (where permitted under this Agreement) against the other party before the end of the Informal Resolution Period. Both parties will attempt to personally meet and confer, via telephone or videoconference, with each other during the Informal Resolution Period in a good-faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute. If a Dispute is not resolved during the Informal Resolution Period, you or COGNOSPHERE may initiate an arbitration proceeding or (where permitted under this Agreement) file a claim in court as described below. A party’s failure to satisfy the condition precedent of complying with the Informal Dispute Resolution procedures entitles the opposing party to seek immediate dismissal of the arbitration or (where permitted under these Terms) litigation and the right to seek reimbursement of its costs.

(ii). **Written Notice of Dispute.**

The informal Dispute resolution process shall be deemed to have begun upon the receipt of written notice from one party to the other ("Written Notice of Dispute"). The Written Notice of Dispute must include: (a) the full name and contact information of the complainant, (b) a detailed description of the claim or Dispute, including dates, (c) the specific damages or other remedy or remedies that the complainant is seeking, and (d) a screenshot from the COGNOSPHERE Services showing your Account and player ID. If COGNOSPHERE has a dispute with you, we must first send a Written Notice of Dispute detailing the Dispute and sending it to you to the address we have on file for you (whether physical or electronic), or, if we do not have an address, via an in-app notice. If you have a dispute with us, you must first send to us a Written Notice of Dispute detailing the Dispute at COGNOSPHERE PTE. LTD. 405 E Laburnum Ave, Ste 3 PMB 109, Richmond, VA 23222.

A Written Notice of Dispute is only valid if it pertains to and is on behalf of the complaining party individually; a Written Notice of Dispute brought on behalf of multiple parties is not valid.

You and COGNOSPHERE understand and agree that any Dispute that is has not first complied with the Informal Dispute Resolution procedures shall not be accepted by the arbitration provider, and shall be deemed frivolous under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b); further, the arbitrator may allocate any arbitration fees and/or costs to any party that files a frivolous claim in violation of this Section 21 (b) (3); and shall be subject to dismissal if asserted in court.

(iii). **Arbitration Procedures.**

\-       If a Dispute cannot be resolved informally through the Informal Dispute Resolution procedures, then either party may initiate binding arbitration. The arbitration will be administered by a single arbitrator by JAMS in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “JAMS Rules”) effective as of the date of the Notice of Dispute, the current version of which are available at the JAMS website, [http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration](http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration), as modified by this Agreement. If, for any reason, JAMS is unable to provide the arbitration, then except as otherwise stated below, you or we may file the Dispute with any national arbitration company that handles consumer arbitrations following procedures that are substantially similar to the JAMS Rules.

\-       Unless contrary to the JAMS Rules, arbitration hearings may be conducted by videoconference unless the arbitrator believes an in-person hearing is necessary. In such instances, the location of an arbitration hearing will be decided pursuant to the JAMS Rules. In an arbitration, the arbitrator shall allow dispositive motions.

\-       You and COGNOSPHERE agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Los Angeles county and the State of Delaware, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. 

\-       The arbitrator will be authorized to award any remedies, including injunctive relief, that would be available to you in an individual lawsuit in court and that are not waivable under applicable law.

\-       The arbitrator will make a decision in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on you and COGNOSPHERE, and any award of the arbitrator may be entered in any federal or state court in Los Angeles county or the State of Delaware.

\-       You and COGNOSPHERE agree that the arbitrator will be bound by this Agreement, including its applicable law provisions in Section 21 (a).

\-       To the greatest and broadest extent allowed by law, the arbitrator shall determine the scope, validity, interpretation and enforceability of this arbitration agreement, including whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration

\-       The JAMS process administer shall decide whether the party complied with the Informal Dispute Resolution procedures, and that decision shall be final and not subject to appeal.

\-       Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the arbitrator may not legally adjudicate or award a particular legal or equitable claim or remedy, such claim or remedy shall be stayed until all other claims and remedies are final and the arbitration completed, after which the federal or state court may adjudicate the remaining claim or remedy. In doing so, the federal or state court is bound under the principles of claim or issue preclusion by the decision of the arbitrator.

\-       Unless limited by the applicable arbitration rules, you will remain responsible for any additional costs you incur during the arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorney fees and expert witness expenses.

\-       You and COGNOSPHERE agree that any award issued by an arbitrator may be appealed in accordance with the JAMS Optional Arbitration Appeal Procedures at either party’s election.

(iv). **Right to Waive.**

Any rights and limitations set forth in this Dispute Resolution provision may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver will not waive or affect any other portion of this Agreement.

(v). **Exception – Mass Arbitration.**

For mass arbitrations (which are defined as 25 or more similar demands for arbitration filed against the same party or related parties by individual claimants represented by either the same law firm or law firms acting in coordination), the JAMS Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines (“JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules”) shall apply. In such proceedings, the parties agree that, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, the Process Administrator (as described in the JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules) and the arbitrators shall have the authority to implement the procedures set forth in the JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules, including the authority to batch together individual arbitration demands into a single coordinated proceeding. All provisions of this Section 21 (b) that are not in conflict with the JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules shall continue to apply. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the arbitration agreement shall be null and void and the parties shall litigate the Dispute in any federal or state court in the Los Angeles county or the state of Delaware in accordance with the applicable law provisions in Section 21 (a). For the avoidance of doubt, however, the Class Action Waiver And Representative-Type Action Waiver in this Section 21(b) shall remain in force and be biding upon the parties.

(vi). **Exception – Litigation of Intellectual Property Claims and Small Claims Court Claims.** (1) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, or other intellectual property rights (an “Intellectual Property Action”), and each party reserves the right to bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to stop and/or seek compensation for the intentional or willful misuse or abuse (e.g. hacking or falsifying location) of their intellectual property, but not, for clarity, claims related to the license granted for the COGNOSPHERE Services under these Agreement. (2) Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for any individual disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction. If an arbitration is filed, before the arbitrator is formally appointed, either party can send written notice to the opposing party and the arbitration provider that it wants the case decided by a small claims court, after which the arbitration provider shall lose jurisdiction and close the case. (3) Such claims stipulated in Sections 21 (b) (vi) are subject to the jurisdiction of any federal or state court in the Los Angeles county and the state of Delaware, as well as applicable law provisions in Section 21 (a).

(vii). **30- DAY** **RIGHT TO OPT-OUT.**

Notwithstanding the above, you and COGNOSPHERE may opt out of the arbitration procedures described above. If you do so, neither you nor COGNOSPHERE can force the other to arbitrate. To opt-out, you must PROVIDE COGNOSPHERE WRITTEN NOTICE OF YOUR DESIRE TO OPT OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT (the "Arbitration Opt-Out Notice"). The Arbitration Opt-Out Notice must include your name and address, your in-game username and the email address you used to set up your Account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you wish not to resolve Disputes with COGNOSPHERE through arbitration. You must send your written Arbitration Opt-Out Notice via U.S. Mail, or by any available nationally recognized delivery service (e.g., UPS, Federal Express, etc.) to COGNOSPHERE PTE. LTD. 405 E Laburnum Ave, Ste 3 PMB 109, Richmond, VA 23222.

If you do not provide COGNOSPHERE with an Arbitration Opt-Out Notice within 30 days from the date that you first consent to this Agreement, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to opt out.
