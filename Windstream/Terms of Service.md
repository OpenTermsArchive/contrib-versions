If you have never used the Services before, and do not wish to be bound by this Agreement, then do not begin using them, and notify us immediately. By accepting this Agreement, you acknowledge that you are 18 years of age or older, are competent to enter into a contract with us, and are authorized to obtain Services or make changes to an existing account. You may obtain a copy of these Terms and any product-specific Terms and Conditions by visiting  https://www.windstream.com, or calling a service representative at 877-807-9463. This Agreement supersedes any and all statements or promises made to you by any of our employees or agents. If you have a written contract with Windstream, then those contract terms and conditions will control.

3. Charges for Services and Taxes, Fees, and Surcharges.

You are responsible for paying all charges applicable to Services provided to you including, but not limited to, monthly recurring charges (“MRCs”), access charges, features, changes and moves to Services, Service repair visits and no-show charges, installation charges, IP-address charges, billing charges, credit-card surcharges, toll, long distance, and directory assistance, equipment fees, and any other usage-based charges at our current rates when used. In addition to the monthly recurring and usage-based charges, other charges (such as taxes, fees, surcharges, and assessments) apply to all Services and Equipment, including how those may change in the future. In certain service areas, paper bills are available for a monthly charge.

To determine whether certain taxes, fees, and surcharges are applicable to Services provided to you, we are required by federal law to obtain your street address, which must be within our service area. You represent and warrant that the address you provide us to obtain Service is correct, and you acknowledge that we are relying on this information to determine which taxes, fees, or surcharges are applicable to your Service. You agree to notify us if your address changes. In the event you do not provide us with a valid address or address change, you may be responsible for additional taxes, fees, surcharges, and penalties associated with failure to pay taxes based on the proper address, and we may terminate your Services.

As a convenience to you, Company may include charges for third-party services on your monthly bill. You should always review your bill carefully, and contact the Company if you are unsure about a charge on your bill. Company also offers the ability to block third-party charges from your monthly bill. This Service is optional and free of charge. If you are interested in adding a third-party block to your account, then call a Company representative at the number found at the top-right-hand corner of your statement to determine if your account is eligible. The block does not apply to Services provided by Windstream or its affiliates to which you subscribe.

4. Billing and Payment. Rate Increases.

We will bill you the recurring and installation rates you were quoted for Services or those associated with the Services you currently use or previously ordered, with increases on notice. All recurring charges are billed one month in advance. Billing at a location will begin upon the earlier of either (i) the Installation Date (which may be the date administrative access to certain software-based Services are granted to Customer), or (ii) 30 days after delivery of the applicable facility and/or equipment to Customer’s premises (if the delay in connection of the facility and/or equipment is due to Customer or its agent). Company may choose to bill in full monthly increments with no proration for partial service periods, when Service either starts or ends in the middle of a billing cycle.

We reserve the right to back-bill you for Services actually used, but not previously billed.

Payment in full is due no later than the due date indicated on your bill and we may apply a late fee, interest, and other charges (including, but not limited to, collection fees) up to the maximum amount permitted by law. Returned checks, payment by phone, paper bills, and other fees due to your choice of payment method or billing receipt may also be subject to fees. You agree to pay costs and fees, including, but not limited to, attorney fees we incur to collect an unpaid balance from you.

Company may require you to authorize payment for Services by credit card or by debiting a bank account, and no additional notice or consent is required before we invoice the credit card or debit the bank account for all amounts due to us for any reason.

5. Credits, Deposits, and Advanced Payments.

Our agreement to provide you Services is subject to credit approval, and, as such, you authorize us to ask credit-reporting agencies for credit information about you. We may require you to submit an initial deposit and/or an advanced payment as security for payment of charges. In the future, an additional deposit or advanced payment may be required if either the amount/number of Services is increased, you are late on payment or your credit rating changes. Simple interest will be paid on the cash deposit for the period it is held by us, and will be refunded if satisfactory credit has been established or upon termination of Service (if no balance is due). We reserve the right to apply the deposit to any amount due and unpaid, and the payment of a deposit in no way relieves you of paying your bills in a timely manner. Regarding advanced payments, any advanced payment will appear as a credit to your first-month's bill. If you cancel Services before installation, or we cannot install your Services for some reason, then we may refund the advanced payment. We will not refund any advanced payment made after installation of Services.

6. Termination by You. Pre-Installation.

If you are a business customer, and you terminate your order prior to the installation of Services, then you will be required to pay a pre-installation cancellation charge equal to the greater of (i) three (3) months of MRCs. or (ii) our costs to other providers. You agree that this charge is a reasonable measure of the administrative costs and other fees, incurred by us, to prepare for installation.

After Installation.

If you cancel your Services or a portion thereof after installation, then you remain liable for payment of all outstanding charges for all Services you used and Equipment you purchased from us prior to termination. If you terminate Services prior to the last day of your billing cycle, then you will be charged for the full last month of Service with no proration or credit.

Fixed-Term Agreements.

When you purchased your Service(s), you may have been required to commit to a term or a minimum purchase. Either you or we may elect not to renew your service by providing notice to the other no later than thirty (30) days prior to expiration of the fixed term. If neither you nor we deliver a timely notice not to renew, THEN the Services will renew on a month-to-month basis. IF YOU TERMINATE SERVICES AFTER INSTALLATION OR DURING THE INITIAL OR RENEWAL TERM FOR ANY REASON OTHER THAN FOR CAUSE, OR WE TERMINATE FOR CAUSE PURSUANT TO SECTION 7 BELOW, THEN YOU WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY TO US AS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO 100% OF THE MONTHLY RECURRING CHARGES (“MRCS”) MULTIPLIED BY THE NUMBER OF MONTHS REMAINING IN THE THEN CURRENT TERM. IF YOU TERMINATE OR DISCONNECT LESS THAN THE ENTIRETY OF YOUR SERVICES SUCH THAT YOUR ACTUAL USAGE AT A LOCATION FALLS BELOW ANY MINIMUM MONTHLY CHARGE (“MMC”) OR MINIMUM MONTHLY FEE (“MMF”) FOR THAT LOCATION, THEN YOU AGREE TO PAY AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE MMC OR MMF FOR EVERY MONTH REMAINING IN THE THEN CURRENT TERM (“LIQUIDATED DAMAGES”).

You agree that in the event of termination by you, the actual damage to Windstream is difficult to ascertain, and that the early termination fee represents liquidated damages, not a penalty, and is a reasonable estimate of the actual reduction in the value of this Agreement that we will sustain.

Month-to-Month Agreements.

If no length of time is identified on the Service Order or you were not otherwise required to commit to a term, then the term is month-to-month, and you or we may terminate at any time by providing notice at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of termination. You remain liable for payment of all outstanding charges for all Services you used and Equipment you purchased from us prior to termination. If you terminate Service prior to the last day of your billing cycle, then you will be charged for the full last month of Service with no proration or credit.

Bundled Services.

Some plans may offer a discount, if you sign up for bundled Services, and may require a term commitment. If you sign up for bundled Services, then you agree to maintain the bundled Services for the applicable term. If you receive bundled Services, and you subsequently unbundle, terminate, or disconnect any of these Services, or we disconnect any of the Services, then we may adjust the rates for the remaining Service(s) to the then current price.

Change in Location.

A change in your service address or location to which any Service is provided to you may constitute, at our sole discretion, termination of the Services or result in an increase in the prices you must pay for the Services.

Change to Another Carrier.

We may deem a request by you to port your numbers as a request by you to terminate your Agreement. If you choose to port less than all of your numbers, or you leave any Services connected, then we will continue to bill you for the numbers and/or Services still connected.

7. Termination by Us.

Provisioning of the Service is subject to the availability of the requisite equipment and facilities. We may limit, interrupt, suspend, terminate, or refuse to provide a Service if: (a) you do not honor any provision of this Agreement. (b) you use a Service in an adverse manner that affects Windstream’s network or other customers, you have used a Service fraudulently or unlawfully or are suspected of doing so, or there occurs an event for which Windstream reasonably believes that the suspension or termination of Services is necessary to protect Windstream or Windstream’s other customers from an imminent and significant operational, financial or security risk, in which case Windstream will provide advance notice if practicable. (c) you modify your phone, or any software residing thereon, from the original manufacturer specifications, including for the purpose of accessing non-Windstream services. (d) you use a Service in a manner that is excessive or unreasonable when compared to the predominant usage patterns of other customers, on a similar service plan, in your geographic area (and we may, also, implement charges or change you to the appropriate rate plan consistent with such use). (d) resell any Service. (f) for any other reason set forth in the relevant tariffs and price lists or terms and conditions. (g) you do not pay any amount due to us or billed by us on behalf of others, including disputed amounts that Windstream determines are valid charges on your bills and any deposits or advanced payments that Windstream may require. (h) facilities or property associated with providing the Services have been condemned, or use has been prohibited by the government in any manner. (i) you fail to acquire and maintain the right-of-way or property access necessary for installation or maintenance of Services. (j) you are insolvent, have made an assignment for the benefit of credits, or you have filed or had filed against you a petition for bankruptcy. or (k) we determine in our sole discretion that facilities are not technically or economically feasible, including if copper or fiber facilities are no longer available to Windstream at reasonable rates or are not available for any reason, including, but not limited to, regulatory changes or retirement of copper plant pursuant to FCC rules. or (l) you **make nuisance calls**, impersonate another person, use obscene or profane language or are abusive or harassing when communicating with Windstream representatives, and fail to stop the behavior after receiving a written or verbal warning from Windstream. or (m) you fail to comply with any law, or regulation, including but not limited to any applicable regulations and do not cure such failure of compliance within ten (10) days of receiving notice from Windstream. We may restore such interrupted or terminated Service, in our sole discretion, following your correction of the violation and payment of any amounts due (including any restoration charge we assess for restoring your Service).

8. Personal Identifiers.

We assign telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, IP addresses, and other personal identifiers in connection with the Services. You have no proprietary right to any such identifiers, and we reserve the right to change them upon notice to you. In the event that we allow you to transfer a personal identifier to another party to obtain any Services we provide you, we reserve the right, prior to honoring the request for transfer, to charge a fee for the transfer, and to collect any money owed for the Services.

9. Disputed Bills.

You must review bills in a timely manner. To dispute a bill, you must comply with the dispute resolution provisions in Section 10, and submit your dispute, in writing, within 60 days after the date on the bill. You must pay any undisputed portion while your dispute is investigated. You accept all charges on your bill not disputed within 60 days, and must pay those charges.

10. Dispute Resolution.

PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.

By utilizing Windstream’s Services and agreeing to these Terms, you agree to the following dispute resolution procedures. **_You and Windstream agree to waive any right to a trial by jury in a court of general jurisdiction and any right to participate in a class action or consolidated action regarding a dispute as defined below. Specifically, you and Windstream agree to waive any right to pursue a dispute by joining a disputed claim with the disputed claim of any other person or entity or to assert a disputed claim in a representative capacity on behalf of anyone else in any lawsuit, arbitration, or other proceeding._**

If you have a dispute with Windstream, you should notify Windstream’s Customer Care department at the number listed on your invoice. If the Customer Care department is unable to resolve your dispute, you must submit your dispute to us in writing at the following address: Windstream Communications, LLC, 1720 Galleria Boulevard, Charlotte, NC 28270, Attn: Executive Customer Relations. You must describe your dispute and provide enough detail to allow us to understand it and provide any supporting documentation with your written dispute. Visit https://www.windstream.com/about/legal/Legal-Notices for a form that you may, but are not required to, use to submit your written dispute to us. If we have a dispute with you, we will send you a written notice to your billing address to attempt to resolve the dispute. You and Windstream agree that a dispute is any claim or controversy related in any way to Windstream’s Services, including charges for Services, Equipment, Service Order(s), or our agreements pursuant to these Terms or any other agreements, whether the dispute: arises in tort, contract, by statute, or any other legal theory. arises under this or any prior agreement with us. or arises after your Services with Windstream are terminated.

For purposes of this Dispute Resolution section, references to "Windstream", "we", and "us" include our subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns.

If you and Windstream are unable to resolve the dispute after 60 days from the date of receipt of the written dispute, you agree that either you or Windstream shall resolve the dispute in only one of two possible ways: (1) by seeking relief in a small claims or equivalent court, if appropriate under the applicable court’s rules, in the city or county of the billing address reflected on your bill. if the small claims or equivalent court does not allow for declaratory relief then the action could be brought in a court which does have such relief or (2) by arbitration. Further, should the amount in controversy exceed the limits of small claims in the jurisdiction in which the dispute arises, Windstream may seek relief in a court of proper jurisdiction for collection purposes. **This Section does not prohibit you from submitting any issue you have with Windstream to any federal, state, or local governmental agency or public service commission which may be able to seek relief from Windstream on your behalf.** If the dispute is regarding the charges for Services, you agree that if you do not seek relief in small claims or equivalent court or by arbitration following the 60-day dispute period, then you will immediately begin paying the disputed amount that Windstream determines is valid, plus any charges that were not paid during the 60-day dispute period, or Windstream may terminate the Services.

Arbitration

You and Windstream specifically agree to finally resolve all disputes not filed in small claims court by arbitration that will be final and binding on both you and Windstream, subject to any exceptions required by applicable law. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.

**The following provisions apply to arbitration:**

1.  If you intend to seek arbitration after expiration of the 60-day dispute period noted above, you must first file a claim with JAMS. Visit https://www.windstream.com/about/legal/Legal-Notices for a form that you may, but are not required to, use. The claim must include a description of the dispute, a brief outline of previous efforts to resolve the dispute, all supporting documentation, and a proposed resolution. A copy of the claim and proof of payment of the filing fee, such as a copy of the check or money order, should be sent to Windstream at: 4001 Rodney Parham Rd., Little Rock, AR 72212, Mailstop B1F03-53A, Attn: Legal Department. Unless the customer specifically requests otherwise, the Executive Customer Relations group may still contact customer even if represented by counsel.
2.  During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Windstream or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Windstream is entitled.
3.  After Windstream receives Notice that you have commenced arbitration, it will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $75,000. The arbitration will be governed by the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures ("JAMS Rules"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by JAMS. The JAMS Rules are available online at www.jamsadr.org, by calling JAMS at 1-800-352-5267(JAMS). The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide. Unless Windstream and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the JAMS Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the JAMS Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
4.  For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $75,000, Windstream will pay all JAMS filing, administration and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Windstream for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the JAMS Rules. In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the JAMS rules. You will be entitled to attorneys’ fees from Windstream to at least the extent as you would be in court. If Windstream initiates the arbitration, it will pay those costs regardless of the amount of its claim.
5.  If, after finding in your favor in any respect on the merits of your claim, the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Windstream’s last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, then Windstream shall pay the greater of the award or $5,000 ("the alternative payment"), whichever is greater. If Windstream did not make a written offer to settle the dispute, you will be entitled to receive this alternative payment if the arbitrator awards you any relief on the merits. If you are still a current customer of Windstream when the arbitrator’s award is issued, then Windstream, in its sole discretion, can pay the alternative payment by issuing a credit for services on the Customer’s account.
6.  If you are entitled to the alternative payment, then Windstream will also pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse any reasonable expenses, that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration ("the attorney premium"). If you are not entitled to this attorney premium, Windstream will reimburse for reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable expenses if it is required to do so under applicable law. However, you may not receive both the attorney premium and an award of attorneys’ fees under a statute.
7.  The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits. However, you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or costs.
8.  If the arbitrator not only rules against you but also rules that either the substance of your claim or the relief you requested in your Demand was either frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then responsibility for the costs of arbitration will be set by the JAMS rules. For frivolous cases in which your demand is $10,000 or less, your share of the costs is currently limited to $200, though JAMS may change that amount. If the arbitrator makes this determination, you may be required to reimburse Windstream for paying your share of the arbitration costs.
9.  The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. **YOU AND WINDSTREAM AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.** Further, unless both you and Windstream agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific proviso is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.
10.  **Confidentiality:** Any arbitration shall remain confidential. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Windstream or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Windstream is entitled. Neither you nor Windstream may disclose the existence, content, or result of any arbitration or award, except as may be required by law, or to confirm and enforce an award.
11.  **Notice to California Customers:** California Customers may seek public injunctive relief through arbitration if, and only to the extent, provided by California law (if deemed applicable) and, in the event the provisions of this Section 10 are found to be unenforceable despite the foregoing exception, such California Customers may seek public injunctive relief through the courts only after the individual claims are fully resolved in arbitration. The preceding sentence shall not apply to Customers in any other state.
12.  **Exceptions:** Nothing in this Section shall prevent Windstream from issuing notices, including: takedown notices for alleged trademark or copyright infringement pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. or termination of Service pursuant to Windstream’s Acceptable Use Policy for your abuse of your Internet access Services. Nothing in this Section 10 shall prohibit Windstream from filing a lawsuit in a court of general jurisdiction to collect outstanding balances for unpaid Services or Equipment, any other type of charge owed on your account, or for the theft of any Services or Equipment by you. This Section 10 is intended to resolve outstanding disputes between us, and not to collect a debt owed by you to Windstream.
13.  **Limitation of Liability:** This Section 10 is subject to the Limitation of Liability Section in these Terms and Conditions.
14.  **Limitations Period:** Any written dispute must be brought by you or Windstream within two (2) years after the date the basis for the claim or dispute first arises.

11. Company Provided and Owned Equipment.

Any Equipment installed by us, on your premises, that is not the subject of a sale or lease to you (such as the CSU/DSU interface cards, Channel Bank, and router, if applicable) shall remain at all times our property. It shall remain in good condition, less normal wear and tear. If we do not have access to your premises within 30 days after Services are terminated, then you shall reimburse us for the full purchase price of the equipment, as well as any attorney’s fees and costs. You are responsible for all security measures over the Services, including, but not limited to, access to authorization codes or encryption you deem necessary or required. Once the Equipment is delivered to you, you bear the risk of loss.

Optional Services:

In some areas additional services may also be available. These include Pay-Per-View, VOD, WatchTVEverywhere authentication for online viewing of available channels, cable TV Protection Plus inside wiring coverage, and the lease of digital receivers and cable cards. Leased digital receivers or cable cards may be required for certain channel packages and options. In limited areas Internet and phone options are also available through cable TV.

Additional information about services and company-provided equipment can be found at the cable TV website https://www.windstream.com.

Cable TV Protection Plus Coverage:

Windstream Cable Television is responsible for all cable wiring up to 12 inches beyond the grounding point normally located or installed on the outside of the customer's residence. The customer is responsible for cable wiring from that point. A large percentage of trouble reports are caused by inside wiring, cable outlets or jacks and customer-owned equipment.

A service call charge may be applied if a problem is found in the customer's wiring. In some areas Windstream offers the option of subscribing to Cable TV Protection Plus, a service that provides protection from repair costs when a problem is found with the customer's inside cable wiring or existing cable outlets. Cable TV Protection Plus includes the repair or replacement of up to four existing approved cable outlets and inside cable wiring. All inside cable wiring repairs are subject to Windstream's discretion for post-wiring standards and do not include cable wiring that runs through inside walls. The addition or moving of existing cable outlets or jacks is not included. Cable TV Protection Plus does not cover customer-owned equipment connected to the wiring or intentional damage to inside wiring. Cable TV Protection Plus added on a repair call/visit will be billed at a standard monthly rate.

If a customer chooses not to take the Cable Protection Plus plan, inside wire repairs can be made on a time/material basis. If a customer chooses not to take the Cable TV Protection Plus plan, or doesn't want Windstream to repair the inside wiring problem, then a service call fee will be applied.

Compatible Remote Controls:

If the customer prefers they can obtain other models of universal remotes from various retail stores or manufacturers. Some examples of universal remotes are: Sony Rm-vz220, GE JAS24993, and Logitech Harmony 650.

Special Equipment: A/B Switches:

Cable customers have the option of adding an A/B switch to Their television and cable equipment. A/B switch allows you to receive off-the-air local broadcast television stations or signals not carried on cable via your antenna. A/B switch kits are available from various independent retail vendors.

PARENTAL CONTROL

Customers who desire parental control or channel blocking to prevent children in the household from Viewing some channels or programs, may be able to access these controls through their TV set. If their TV set does not accommodate parental control, in most locations additional options are available from Windstream to block channels. Digital customers may set parental controls themselves via the on-screen menu. For example, on many Motorola receivers, from the Main Menu, highlight the "Parents" icon and press "OK." Follow on-screen instructions to enter a four-digit PIN. A rating level or channel can be locked by highlighting it and then pressing "Lock." On Scientific Atlanta / Cisco equipment, press "Menu" on the remote control, and press the "Up/Down" setting to activate Parental Control. Press "Select" to enter a four-digit PIN. Non-digital customers may contact Windstream to request a special filter or device to prevent reception of certain channels. The filter can be purchased by special order and may require a prepayment.

Service Procedures: Installation &. Service Maintenance Policies:

Installation work will be performed on an appointment basis. Appointments are usually scheduled in four-hour blocks during normal business hours.

If our installer or technician is running late, we will attempt to contact the customer and reschedule the appointment at a time convenient for them.

Standard installations (those that are located up to 125 feet from our existing distribution system) will normally be performed within seven business days after an order has been placed. If it is determined that a non-standard installation is needed, the estimated cost and completion date will be provided to the customer in advance. Our technical staff will not enter a customer’s home to perform work unless a responsible adult over 18 years of age is present. We have established this policy to protect our customers and our employees.

Outages/Service Interruptions:

We will normally respond to service interruptions and other service problems as soon as possible, and normally within 24 hours from the time we are notified of an interruption. We will normally respond to other non-outage service problems by the next business day. For outages beyond our control (such as natural disasters or severe weather-related problems), we will respond as promptly as possible. Generally, it is our policy to issue a credit, upon request, for service interruptions greater than 24 hours.

Windstream Cable Television customer service representatives are available during normal business hours, and after-hours emergency reporting service is available 24 hours a day. Customers are asked to please call us in a timely manner if a problem with their cable TV arises. We will not issue credit for service interruptions if we are not notified promptly or for situations beyond our control.

Service Call Policy:

A service charge will apply for repairs to inside wiring or customer modifications to our wiring. A charge may also apply for repairing wire/cable damaged by the customer or by others working on the customer's property. A service charge may apply for a service call to help connect a digital video or audio device or to reprogram a TV, a digital video device or other non-cable company equipment.

Signal Complaint Procedures:

Please be assured that we will work to resolve all service problems as soon as possible. Customers are advised to contact our customer service center or retail store and explain their problem.

Additional information about how to use the cable TV service and company-provided equipment can be found at the cable TV web site https://www.windstream.com.

Customers may need to lease a receiver from the cable company for reception of some digital channels.

Digital receivers typically provide both audio and video outputs to facilitate connection to the consumer’s TV set, external devices such as DVD players, audio systems and gaming devices. The use of certain types of receivers may deactivate the use of some television features such as picture in picture.

Windstream provides digital customers a universal remote control with the lease of a digital receiver.

Instructions for programming the remote and various device codes can be found online at https://www.windstream.com.

Troubleshooting

Customers who experience problems with their television reception should please keep in mind that it may or may not be related to their cable TV service.

Troubleshooting Tips

Poor or no video:

*   First check to see if all TVs in the home are experiencing the same problem. If the problem is only on one set, it is likely that the issue is related to the connection inside the home.
*   For customers who have recently installed or moved equipment, the connections may need to be checked.
*   Please check to ensure that the correct TV “input" or "source" is selected by using the TV remote to slowly toggle through available settings. Some digital TVs require a moment for each setting to be read.
*   For televisions connected via a coaxial cable to a digital device such as a cable receiver, DVR, or DVD player, please ensure the TV is set to the designated input channel (normally channel 03 or 04).
*   To ensure reliable operation, all connections to television sets, wall jacks and any connected video devices should be securely attached to the appropriate inputs.
*   The cables used to attach devices can affect video and audio quality. The ends of coax cables should be undamaged and the connector center pin should be straight. Damaged cables or connections should be replaced.
*   Moving coaxial cables away from other cables can sometimes prevent signal problems. TV cables may be receiving electromagnetic interference from nearby power cables or other electronic devices. If separating the cables improves the picture, cable ties or tape can be used to hold them in place.

Picture, but no sound:

*   Check to ensure that the MUTE setting is not activated on the TV or on any digital video devices.
*   Please check to ensure that the correct TV 'input" or "source" is selected by using your TV remote to slowly toggle through available settings. Some digital TVs require a moment for each setting to be read.
*   For help in troubleshooting a problem, please call Windstream. We will be glad to assist and schedule a home appointment if needed. Our goal is to provide the best quality service to our customers.

Interference From Nature

*   Lightning: During electrical storms, we advise that customers unplug their television set(s) and disconnect their incoming cable line(s). Windstream is not responsible for any damage to customer-owned equipment caused by lightning or any other Act of God beyond our control.
*   Picture Distortion: Heavy rain or other atmospheric conditions can occasionally interfere with satellite signals and cause temporary reception difficulties.
*   Sun Outages: For a few days in the spring and fall, brief interruptions (5 -10 minutes) in satellite-delivered programming may occur due to an alignment between the sun, the orbiting communications satellite and our receiving antenna. We appreciate our customers’ understanding during these brief "sun outages."

Theft of Cable TV Service

The 1984 Cable Act, as amended by the 1992 Cable Act, was enacted by the U.S. Congress and created both civil and criminal penalties against manufacturers, suppliers and users of unauthorized cable devices.

This federal theft-of-service law supplements any existing state or local laws. The federal law prohibits the interception or receipt of any communication service over a cable system, unless authorized by the operator. This includes the theft of audio, video, textual, data or other service, including data transmitted to or from a subscriber over a system that has interactive capability. Further, the law pertains to both the manufacturers and distributors of equipment, as well as individuals. The Cable Act provides a cable operator the right to seek substantial monetary damages with regard to theft of its cable services. In addition, violators may face substantial fines or imprisonment if found guilty of criminal charges. Congress has taken the foregoing actions because it believes that theft of cable service poses a major threat to the economic viability of cable operators and cable program suppliers, and it creates unfair burdens on cable subscribers who are forced to subsidize the benefits that other individuals are getting by receiving cable service without paying for it. Also, tampering with cable lines often causes reception problems for paying customers. Therefore, if a customer is aware of persons receiving unauthorized cable service, please call us confidentially. We will follow up to ensure that their cable TV service reception is not affected by someone else's tampering.
