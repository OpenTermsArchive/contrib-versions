Promotional terms may include a term commitment and an early termination fee in the event the Service is not installed or maintained, or in the event you disconnect Service prior to the end of the term.
    
    **"Service Order”** means the form (whether paper or electronic, including online order forms), if any, in which you apply for or make changes to Services and may include the length of time you will subscribe to a Service, rate plans, access charges, fees, taxes and surcharges, choice of long distance carrier, and the Equipment you have selected.
    
    **2\. Agreement and Acceptance.** This Agreement incorporates by reference, and you agree to be bound by the following, in this order of priority **AND INCLUDING ANY CHANGES (SEE SECTION 23 BELOW):** 1) any applicable tariffs filed with the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) or the relevant state public service commission. 2) The FCC or state web-posted price lists or terms and conditions (either, “price lists”) posted at http://www.windstream.com/documents/detariffedservices.pdf. 3) the product- or bundle-specific Terms and Conditions, including any Promotional Terms (see Section 27 herein and Your Bill Messages) and any additional agreements associated with such products. 4) the Service Order, if any. 5) any relevant click-through agreement for the Services you received. 6) these Terms and Conditions (“Terms”). 7) the Acceptable Use Policy posted at http://www2.windstream.net/customersupport/usersguide/accept/accept.html. and 8) the Privacy Policy posted at http://www.windstream.com/privacy.aspx.
    
    You accept this Agreement when you do any of the following: (a) give us your written or electronic signature. (b) tell us orally or electronically that you accept (i.e., by clicking the “I Accept” button for online purchases or account changes). or (c) use any Services. If you have never used the Services before, and do not wish to be bound by this Agreement, then do not begin using them, and notify us immediately. By accepting this Agreement, you acknowledge that you are 18 years of age or older, are competent to enter into a contract with us, and are authorized to obtain Services or make changes to an existing account. You may obtain a copy of these Terms and any product-specific Terms and Conditions by visiting www.windstream.com, or calling a service representative at 877-807-9463. This Agreement supersedes any and all statements or promises made to you by any of our employees or agents. If you are a business customer with an existing contract, then those contract terms will control.
    
    **3.  Charges for Services and Taxes, Fees, and Surcharges.** You are responsible for paying all charges applicable to Services provided to you including, but not limited to, monthly recurring charges (“MRCs”), access charges, features, changes and moves to Services, Service repair visits and no-show charges, installation charges, IP-address charges, billing charges, credit-card surcharges, toll, long distance, and directory assistance, equipment fees, and any other usage-based charges at our current rates when used. In addition to the monthly recurring and usage-based charges, other charges (such as taxes, fees, surcharges, and assessments) apply to all Services and Equipment, including how those may change in the future. In certain service areas, paper bills are available for a monthly charge.
    
    To determine whether certain taxes, fees, and surcharges are applicable to Services provided to you, we are required by federal law to obtain your street address, which must be within our service area. You represent and warrant that the address you provide us to obtain Service is correct, and you acknowledge that we are relying on this information to determine which taxes, fees, or surcharges are applicable to your Service. You agree to notify us if your address changes. In the event you do not provide us with a valid address or address change, you may be responsible for additional taxes, fees, surcharges, and penalties associated with failure to pay taxes based on the proper address, and we may terminate your Services.
    
    As a convenience to you, Company may include charges for third-party services on your monthly bill. You should always review your bill carefully, and contact the Company if you are unsure about a charge on your bill. Company also offers the ability to block third-party charges from your monthly bill. This Service is optional and free of charge. If you are interested in adding a third-party block to your account, then call a Company representative at the number found at the top-right-hand corner of your statement to determine if your account is eligible. The block does not apply to Services provided by Windstream or its affiliates to which you subscribe.
    
    **4.  Billing and Payment. Rate Increases.** We will bill you the recurring and installation rates you were quoted for Services or those associated with the Services you currently use or previously ordered, with increases on notice. All recurring charges are billed one month in advance. Billing at a location will begin upon the earlier of either (i) the Installation Date (which may be the date administrative access to certain software-based Services are granted to Customer), or (ii) 30 days after delivery of the applicable facility and/or equipment to Customer’s premises (if the delay in connection of the facility and/or equipment is due to Customer or its agent).  Company may choose to bill in full monthly increments with no proration for partial service periods, when Service either starts or ends in the middle of a billing cycle.
    
    We reserve the right to back-bill you for Services actually used, but not previously billed.
    
    Payment in full is due no later than the due date indicated on your bill and we may apply a late fee, interest, and other charges (including, but not limited to, collection fees) up to the maximum amount permitted by law. Returned checks, payment by phone, paper bills, and other fees due to your choice of payment method or billing receipt may also be subject to fees. You agree to pay costs and fees, including, but not limited to, attorney fees we incur to collect an unpaid balance from you.
    
    Company may require you to authorize payment for Services by credit card or by debiting a bank account, and no additional notice or consent is required before we invoice the credit card or debit the bank account for all amounts due to us for any reason.
    
    **5.  Credits, Deposits,** **and Advanced Payments** **.** Our agreement to provide you Services is subject to credit approval, and, as such, you authorize us to ask credit-reporting agencies for credit information about you. We may require you to submit an initial deposit and/or an advanced payment as security for payment of charges. In the future, an additional deposit or advanced payment may be required if either the amount/number of Services is increased, you are late on payment or your credit rating changes. Simple interest will be paid on the cash deposit for the period it is held by us, and will be refunded if satisfactory credit has been established or upon termination of Service (if no balance is due). We reserve the right to apply the deposit to any amount due and unpaid, and the payment of a deposit in no way relieves you of paying your bills in a timely manner. Regarding advanced payments, any advanced payment will appear as a credit to your first-month's bill.  If you cancel Services before installation, or we cannot install your Services for some reason, then we may refund the advanced payment. We will not refund any advanced payment made after installation of Services.
    
    **6.  Termination by You.**
    
    **Pre-Installation.** If you are a business customer, and you terminate your order prior to the installation of Services, then you will be required to pay a pre-installation cancellation charge equal to the greater of (i) three (3) months of MRCs. or (ii) our costs to other providers. You agree that this charge is a reasonable measure of the administrative costs and other fees, incurred by us, to prepare for installation.
    
    **After Installation.**  If you cancel your Services or a portion thereof after installation, then you remain liable for payment of all outstanding charges for all Services you used and Equipment you purchased from us prior to termination. If you terminate Services prior to the last day of your billing cycle, then you will be charged for the full last month of Service with no proration or credit.
    
    **Fixed-Term Agreements.** When you purchased your Service(s), you may have been required to commit to a term or a minimum purchase. Either you or we may elect not to renew your service by providing notice to the other no later than thirty (30) days prior to expiration of the fixed term. If neither you nor we deliver a timely notice not to renew, THEN the Services will renew on a month-to-month basis. IF YOU TERMINATE SERVICES AFTER INSTALLATION OR DURING THE INITIAL OR RENEWAL TERM FOR ANY REASON OTHER THAN FOR CAUSE, OR WE TERMINATE FOR CAUSE PURSUANT TO SECTION 7 BELOW, THEN YOU WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY TO US AS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO 100% OF THE MONTHLY RECURRING CHARGES (“MRCS”) MULTIPLIED BY THE NUMBER OF MONTHS REMAINING IN THE THEN CURRENT TERM. IF YOU TERMINATE OR DISCONNECT LESS THAN THE ENTIRETY OF YOUR SERVICES SUCH THAT YOUR ACTUAL USAGE AT A LOCATION FALLS BELOW ANY MINIMUM MONTHLY CHARGE (“MMC”) OR MINIMUM MONTHLY FEE (“MMF”) FOR THAT LOCATION, THEN YOU AGREE TO PAY AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE MMC OR MMF FOR EVERY MONTH REMAINING IN THE THEN CURRENT TERM (“LIQUIDATED DAMAGES”).
    
    You agree that in the event of termination by you, the actual damage to Windstream is difficult to ascertain, and that the early termination fee represents liquidated damages, not a penalty, and is a reasonable estimate of the actual reduction in the value of this Agreement that we will sustain.
    
    **Month-to-Month Agreements.** If no length of time is identified on the Service Order or you were not otherwise required to commit to a term, then the term is month-to-month, and you or we may terminate at any time by providing notice at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of termination. You remain liable for payment of all outstanding charges for all Services you used and Equipment you purchased from us prior to termination. If you terminate Service prior to the last day of your billing cycle, then you will be charged for the full last month of Service with no proration or credit.
    
    **Bundled Services.** Some plans may offer a discount, if you sign up for bundled Services, and may require a term commitment. If you sign up for bundled Services, then you agree to maintain the bundled Services for the applicable term. If you receive bundled Services, and you subsequently unbundle, terminate, or disconnect any of these Services, or we disconnect any of the Services, then we may adjust the rates for the remaining Service(s) to the then current price.
    
    **Change in Location** **.** A change in your service address or location to which any Service is provided to you may constitute, at our sole discretion, termination of the Services or result in an increase in the prices you must pay for the Services.
    
    **Change to Another Carrier** **.** We may deem a request by you to port your numbers as a request by you to terminate your Agreement. If you choose to port less than all of your numbers, or you leave any Services connected, then we will continue to bill you for the numbers and/or Services still connected.
    
    **7.  Termination by Us.** Provisioning of the Service is subject to the availability of the requisite equipment and facilities. We may limit, interrupt, suspend, terminate, or refuse to provide a Service if: (a) you do not honor any provision of this Agreement. (b) you use a Service in an adverse manner that affects Windstream’s network or other customers, you have used a Service fraudulently or unlawfully or are suspected of doing so, or there occurs an event for which Windstream reasonably believes that the suspension or termination of Services is necessary to protect Windstream or Windstream’s other customers from an imminent and significant operational, financial or security risk, in which case Windstream will provide advance notice if practicable. (c) you modify your phone, or any software residing thereon, from the original manufacturer specifications, including for the purpose of accessing non-Windstream services. (d) you use a Service in a manner that is excessive or unreasonable when compared to the predominant usage patterns of other customers, on a similar service plan, in your geographic area (and we may, also, implement charges or change you to the appropriate rate plan consistent with such use). (d) resell any Service. (f) for any other reason set forth in the relevant tariffs and price lists or terms and conditions. (g) you do not pay any amount due to us or billed by us on behalf of others, including disputed amounts that Windstream determines are valid charges on your bills and any deposits or advanced payments that Windstream may require. (h) facilities or property associated with providing the Services have been condemned, or use has been prohibited by the government in any manner. (i) you fail to acquire and maintain the right-of-way or property access necessary for installation or maintenance of Services. (j) you are insolvent, have made an assignment for the benefit of credits, or you have filed or had filed against you a petition for bankruptcy. or (k) we determine in our sole discretion that facilities are not technically or economically feasible. or (l) you make nuisance calls, impersonate another person, use obscene or profane language or are abusive or harassing when communicating with Windstream representatives, and fail to stop the behavior after receiving a written or verbal warning from Windstream. or (m) you fail to comply with any law, or regulation, including but not limited to any applicable regulations and does not cure such failure of compliance within ten (10) days of receiving notice from Windstream . We may restore such interrupted or terminated Service, in our sole discretion, following your correction of the violation and payment of any amounts due (including any restoration charge we assess for restoring your Service).
    
    **8.  Personal Identifiers.** We assign telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, IP addresses, and other personal identifiers in connection with the Services. You have no proprietary right to any such identifiers, and we reserve the right to change them upon notice to you. In the event that we allow you to transfer a personal identifier to another party to obtain any Services we provide you, we reserve the right, prior to honoring the request for transfer, to charge a fee for the transfer, and to collect any money owed for the Services.

    Regarding arbitration, you and Windstream specifically agree to finally resolve all disputes not filed in small claims court by arbitration that will be final and binding on both you and Windstream, subject to any exceptions required by applicable law. **_The following provisions shall apply to arbitration:_**
    
    1.  **Notice:** If you want to arbitrate a dispute with Windstream after expiration of the 60 day dispute period noted above, you must file a claim with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). Click here http://www.windstream.com/legal.aspx for a form that you may, but are not required to, use. The claim must include a description of the dispute, a brief outline of previous efforts to resolve the dispute, all supporting documentation, and a proposed resolution. A copy of the claim and proof of payment of the filing fee, such as a copy of the check or money order, should be sent to Windstream at: 4001 Rodney Parham, Little Rock, Arkansas 72212, Mailstop B1F03-71A, Attn: Legal Department (“Arbitration Notice Address”). Windstream will reimburse you for the filing fee if your claim does not exceed $75,000. If Windstream wants to arbitrate a dispute with you after expiration of the 60 day dispute period noted above, Windstream will send a copy of its claim to your billing address.
    
    *   **Applicable Law:** The interpretation and enforceability of the arbitration provisions, and whether a dispute is subject to arbitration, is subject to the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) only and not state law.
    
    *   **Applicable Rules:** Windstream and you agree that the arbitration will be conducted by the AAA. The rules governing the arbitration proceeding will be the current Consumer Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (“AAA Rules”) from the American Arbitration Association. The AAA rules can be found at www.adr.org, or can be obtained by calling 1.800.778.7879.
    
    *   **Method of Arbitration:** If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Windstream agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the written documents submitted, by telephone, or in person in the city or county of the billing address reflected on your bill. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA rules. The written documents can be the notice to arbitrate that either of us send to the other regarding arbitration and referenced above.
    
    *   **Arbitration Costs and Attorney Fees:** If you properly file a claim with AAA pursuant to these arbitration provisions, and the amount of your dispute does not exceed $10,000, Windstream agrees to pay for all AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees (“Arbitration Costs”), and your reasonable attorney’s fees (with reasonable hourly rates and expenses to be determined by the location of the arbitration) (“Attorney Fees”) incurred by you regardless of the decision of the arbitrator, unless your claim is found to be frivolous or improper (as set forth in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 11) by the arbitrator. A portion of the payment of Arbitration Costs may be in the form of reimbursement, as you may be required to place a deposit when your notice of arbitration is filed. If the claim is found to be frivolous or improper, the AAA Rules will apply regarding payment of Arbitration Costs. If your dispute exceeds $10,000 but not $75,000, Windstream agrees to pay all the Arbitration Costs and 50% of your Attorney Fees. For disputes of $75,000 or more, the AAA rules regarding Arbitration Costs will apply. However, Windstream agrees to pay 50% of the Arbitration Costs, and each party will pay its own Attorney Fees incurred for disputes of $75,000 or more. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if your claim is found to be frivolous or improper (as set forth in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 11) by the arbitrator, Windstream will have no obligation to pay any of your Attorney Fees. If Windstream disputes the reasonableness of any Attorney Fees, you agree that the presiding arbitrator shall determine what is a reasonable fee, and his/her decision regarding Attorney Fees will be binding on both you and Windstream. In no event shall Windstream be entitled to an award of its Attorney Fees.
    
    *   **Awards:** If the arbitrator’s award is in your favor and is greater than the value of Windstream’s last settlement offer made to you prior to selection of the arbitrator, Windstream will pay you the amount of the arbitrator’s award or $3,000, whichever amount is greater. Windstream also will pay your attorney’s reasonable fees, including expenses, or $2,500, whichever amount is greater.
    
    *   **Injunctive Relief:** If you seek declaratory or injunctive relief in the arbitration, the arbitrator may award such relief only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by your individual claim.
    
    *   **Consolidation:** The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. 
    
    1.  **Confidentiality:** Any arbitration shall remain confidential. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Windstream or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Windstream is entitled. Neither you nor Windstream may disclose the existence, content, or result of any arbitration or award, except as may be required by law, or to confirm and enforce an award.
    
    *   **Exceptions:** Nothing in this Section shall prevent Windstream from issuing notices, including: takedown notices for alleged trademark or copyright infringement pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. or termination of Service pursuant to Windstream’s Acceptable Use Policy for your abuse of your Internet access Services. Nothing in this Section shall prohibit Windstream from filing a lawsuit in a court of general jurisdiction to collect outstanding balances for unpaid Services or Equipment, any other type of charge owed on your account, or for the theft of any Services or Equipment by you. This Section is intended to resolve outstanding disputes between us, and not to collect a debt owed by you to Windstream.
    
    *   **Limitation of Liability:** This Section is subject to the Limitation of Liability Section in these Terms and Conditions.
    
    **l.**    **Limitations Period:** Any dispute must be brought by you or Windstream within two years after the date the basis for the claim or dispute first arises.
    
    Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms and Conditions to the contrary, you and Windstream agree that if Windstream makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the notice addresses), you may reject any such change by sending Windstream written notice within 30 days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any such change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.
    
    If the provisions concerning the waiver of the class or consolidated actions, or the provisions regarding mandatory arbitration, are deemed unenforceable or void as a matter of law, you and Windstream agree that all claims will be brought in a court of general jurisdiction, and not resolved through arbitration. **YOU AND WINDSTREAM WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT FOR THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY US.**
