3. Dispute Resolution.
----------------------

PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY - IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.  This section outlines how disputes between you and Windstream will be resolved through an informal dispute resolution process, individual arbitration, or small claims court. 

For purposes of this Dispute Resolution section, references to "Windstream", "we", and "us" include our subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns. This Dispute Resolution provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.

_**You and Windstream agree to waive any right to a trial by jury in a court of general jurisdiction and any right to participate in a class or mass action or consolidated action regarding a dispute except as provided in this section.**_ _Specifically, you and Windstream agree to waive any right to pursue a dispute by joining a disputed claim with the disputed claim of any other person or entity or to assert a disputed claim in a representative capacity on behalf of anyone else in any lawsuit, arbitration, or other proceeding._

_a. Here are the ways you would resolve a dispute with Windstream._

1. Resolving your dispute directly with Windstream within sixty (60) days.
    * If you have a dispute, first, notify Windstream’s Customer Care department at the number listed on your invoice. If the Customer Care department is unable to resolve your dispute, you must submit your dispute in writing at the following address:
        * Windstream Communications, LLC
        * 4001 N. Rodney Parham Rd.
        * Little Rock, AR 72212
        * Attn: Executive Customer Relations

Describe your dispute with enough detail to allow us to understand it and provide any supporting documentation with your written dispute. Visit [www.windstream.com/notice-of-dispute](https://www.windstream.com/Windstream-residential/media/res/legal/Windstream-Notice-for-Dispute.pdf)https://www.windstream.com/about/legal/Legal-Notices for a form that you may, but are not required to, use to submit your written dispute to us. To safeguard your account, you might be required to provide authentication and/or consent for Windstream to discuss or share your account information with anyone other than you, including but not limited to an attorney representing you. If we have a dispute with you, we will send you a written notice to your billing address to attempt to resolve the dispute.

A dispute is any claim or controversy related in any way to Windstream’s Services, including charges for Services, Equipment, Service Order(s), or our agreements pursuant to these Terms or any other agreements, whether the dispute: arises in tort, contract, by statute, or any other legal theory; arises under this or any prior agreement with us; or arises after your Services with Windstream are terminated.  Note this Section 3 is intended to resolve outstanding disputes between us, and not to collect a debt owed by you to Windstream.

b. Pursuing small claims or arbitration.

If you and Windstream are unable to resolve the dispute within sixty (60) days from the date Windstream receives the written dispute, except as provided in subsection 3(b)(x), you agree that the dispute shall be resolved in only one of two possible ways:

a)   **Small Claims Court.**  You may seek relief in a small claims or equivalent court, if appropriate under the applicable court’s rules, in the city or county of the billing address reflected on your bill, so long as the action remains in that court and is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction. If the small claims or equivalent court does not allow for declaratory relief, then the action could be brought in a court which does have such relief.

b)   **Arbitration.** All disputes not filed in small claims court will be resolved by arbitration that will be final and binding on both you and Windstream, subject to any exceptions required by applicable law.  An arbitration is a less formal alternative to a lawsuit or jury trial in court.  While the procedures in arbitration may be different, they are more streamlined with limited discovery to simplify the process and reduce cost. An arbitrator applies the same law and can award the same damages and relief as a court would under the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.

**This Section does not prohibit you from submitting any issue you have with Windstream to any federal, state, or local governmental agency or public service commission which may be able to seek relief from Windstream on your behalf.** If the dispute is regarding the charges for Services, you agree that if you do not seek relief in small claims or equivalent court or by arbitration following the sixty (60) day dispute period, then you will immediately begin paying the disputed amount that Windstream determines is valid, plus any charges that were not paid during the sixty (60) day dispute period, or Windstream may terminate the Services.

     **_b. The following provisions apply to arbitration._**

1. Notice of Arbitration. If you intend to seek arbitration after expiration of the sixty (60) day written dispute period, you must first file a claim with JAMS. Visit [www.windstream.com/notice-for-arbitration](https://www.windstream.com/Windstream-residential/media/res/Unsorted/form_notice_for_arbitration_revised-03-09-22.pdf#:~:text=Windstream%20is%20committed%20to%20resolving%20its%20customers%E2%80%99%20disputes,proposed%20resolution.%20This%20notice%20should%20be%20sent%20to%3A)https://www.windstream.com/about/legal/Legal-Notices for a form that you may, but are not required to, use. Your claim must include:
    1. your account number;
    2. the Services (if any) to which your claim pertains;
    3. a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute;
    4. a brief outline of previous efforts to resolve the dispute;
    5. an explanation of the specific relief sought and the basis for the calculations;
    6. all supporting documentation; and
    7.  if you have retained an attorney, your signed statement authorizing Windstream to disclose your confidential account records to your attorney if necessary to resolve your claim.  

The claim must be signed, and a copy along with proof of payment of the filing fee should be sent to Windstream at:

4001 Rodney Parham Rd.  
Little Rock, AR 72212  
Mailstop B1F03-53A  
Attn: Legal Department

Unless you specifically request otherwise, the Executive Customer Relations group may still contact you regarding the claim even if you are represented by counsel.

1. Arbitration Fees and Applicable Rules.  The arbitration will be governed by the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures ("JAMS Rules"), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by JAMS. The JAMS Rules are available online at www.jamsadr.orgor by calling JAMS at 1-800-352-5267(JAMS).

The arbitrator is bound by these Terms. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, _except_ issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the Dispute Resolution provision, whether a dispute can or must be brought in arbitration, or whether there has been a violation of the Class or Mass Action prohibition, which are for the court to decide.

Unless agreed otherwise, arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If your claim is $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the JAMS Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the JAMS Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.

After Windstream receives notice that you have commenced arbitration and proof of payment, we will reimburse you for payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is greater than $75,000 (“JAMS’ fees”). A consumer’s share of the filing fee is currently limited to $250, though JAMS may change that amount. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules. You agree to reimburse Windstream for all monies previously disbursed that are your obligation to pay under the JAMS Rules. In addition, if you initiate an arbitration seeking more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of JAMS’ fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules. If Windstream initiates the arbitration, it will pay JAMS’ fees regardless of the amount of its claim.

1. Alternate Payment by Windstream.  If, after finding in your favor in any respect on the merits of your claim, the arbitrator issues you an award, exclusive of attorneys’ fees, that is greater than the value of Windstream’s last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, then Windstream shall pay the greater of the award or $5,000 ("the Alternative Payment"). If Windstream did not make a written offer to settle the dispute, you are eligible to receive the Alternative Payment if the arbitrator awards you relief less than $5,000 on the merits. If you are still a current customer when the arbitrator’s award is issued, then Windstream, in its sole discretion, can pay the Alternative Payment by issuing a credit for services on the Customer’s account. 
2. Attorneys’ Fees.  If you are entitled to the Alternative Payment, then Windstream will also pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse any reasonable expenses, that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration ("the Attorney Premium"). If you are not entitled to this Attorney Premium, Windstream will reimburse for reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable expenses if it is required to do so under applicable law. However, you may not receive both the Attorney Premium and an award of attorneys’ fees under a statute.
3. No Duplicative Awards.  The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, the Alternative Payment and the Attorney Premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits. However, you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or costs.
4. Individual Arbitration Required. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. **YOU AND WINDSTREAM AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF, CLASS MEMBER OR MASS ACTION MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, MASS ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING EXCEPT AS OUTLINED IN SUBSECTION 3(B)(VII).**

Unless agreed otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding, or private attorney general claims. The parties expressly waive the right to have any dispute or claim brought, heard, administered, resolved, or arbitrated as a Mass Action. Neither an arbitrator nor an arbitration provider shall have authority to hear, arbitrate, or administer any Mass Action except as provided in subsection 3(b)(vii) below. A “Mass Action” includes, but is not limited to, instances in which you or Windstream are represented by counsel, a law firm, or collection of coordinated law firms that has filed twenty-five (25) or more arbitration demands of a substantially similar nature against the other party within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the arbitration demand filed on your or Windstream’s behalf.

You and Windstream agree that one of the essential purposes of this Dispute Resolution provision is to provide for the prompt, efficient, and cost-effective resolution of disputes and is a material part of these Terms. Subsection 3(b)(vii) furthers these purposes by ensuring disputes are resolved on an individual basis and by providing for alternative low-cost paths to resolving individual disputes. Any claim that all or part of this Class or Mass Action waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If this specific proviso is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution provision shall be null and void.

1. Procedure in the case of Prohibited Mass Actions. If a court determines that a breach of the Dispute Resolution provision has occurred, or that you have participated in a prohibited Mass Action, then we agree that the following shall apply, in addition to any other remedy ordered by a court.

                  **a. Opting Out.**  If it is determined that there has been a violation of the Mass Action waiver, the parties may opt out of arbitration within thirty (30) days of the decision and proceed on an individual basis in small claims court. You may opt out of arbitration by providing written notice of your intention to opt out to the arbitration provider and to Windstream at:

4001 Rodney Parham Rd.  
Little Rock, AR 72212  
Mailstop B1F03-53A  
Attn: Legal Department.

This written notice must be signed by you, and not any attorney, agent, or other representative of yours. Windstream may opt out of arbitration by sending written notice of its intention to opt out to the arbitration provider and to you or your attorney, agent, or representative if you are represented. The ability to opt out of arbitration described in this subsection 3(b)(vii) only applies if it has been determined by a court that there has been a violation of the Mass Actions prohibition. If the parties do not opt out of the arbitration, the parties agree to following the batching procedure outlined below. **You agree to this process even though it may delay the arbitration of your claim.**

     **b. Batching.** In the first batch, claimants’ counsel and Windstream will each select ten (10) cases (twenty (20) cases total) to be filed in arbitration and resolved individually by different arbitrators. In the meantime, no other cases may be filed or proceed in arbitration, and JAMS must not assess or demand payment of fees for the remaining cases, administer, or accept them.

After the first batch is completed, the parties must engage in a single mediation of all remaining cases with the mediation costs being split between the parties. If the parties cannot agree how to resolve the remaining cases after mediation, they will repeat the process of selecting and filing twenty (20) additional cases to be resolved individually by different arbitrators, followed by mediation.

If any claims remain after the second batch, the process will be repeated until all claims are resolved. However, a total of fifty (50) cases may be filed in the third and later batches and will be randomly selected. The parties may also negotiate with JAMS regarding the amount or timing of JAMS fees.

     **c. Tolling.**  If this subsection 3(b)(vii) applies to a dispute filed with JAMS and the parties elect the batching procedure set forth herein, the relief set forth in that claim will be extended (including the tolling of any applicable statute of limitations or contractual limitations period for the claims and requested relief) until that claim is selected for a batched proceeding, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved.  A court will have the authority to enforce this subsection, including by enjoining the Mass Action filing, the prosecution or administration of arbitrations, or the assessment or collection of JAMS’ fees.

     **d. Severability.**  This subsection 3(b)(vii) is intended to be severable from the rest of this Dispute Resolution provision. If, a court determines that the batching process in this subsection is not enforceable, then the cases may be filed in arbitration and the payment of JAMS filing, administration, case-management, hearing, and arbitrator fees will be assessed as the arbitrations advance and arbitrators are appointed rather than when the arbitrations are initiated.

1. **Confidentiality.  Any arbitration shall remain confidential. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by either Windstream or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Windstream is entitled. Neither you nor Windstream may disclose the existence, content, or result of any arbitration or award, except as may be required by law, or to confirm and enforce an award.**
2. **Notice to California Customers.** California Customers may seek public injunctive relief through arbitration if, and only to the extent, provided by California law (if deemed applicable) and, in the event the provisions of this Section 3 are found to be unenforceable despite the foregoing exception, such California Customers may seek public injunctive relief through the courts only after the individual claims are fully resolved in arbitration. The preceding sentence shall not apply to Customers in any other state.
3. **Exceptions.** Nothing in this Section shall prevent Windstream from doing the following:
    1. issuing notices, including takedown notices for alleged trademark or copyright infringement pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act;
    2. termination of Service pursuant to Windstream’s Acceptable Use Policy for your abuse of your Internet access Services; or
    3. filing a lawsuit, including through a third-party collections agency, in a court of general jurisdiction to collect outstanding balances for unpaid Services or Equipment, any other type of charge owed on your account, or for the theft of any Services or Equipment by you even if the amount in controversy exceeds the limits of small claims in the jurisdiction in which the nonpayment arises.
4. **Limitation of Liability.** This Section 3 is subject to the Section 17 (Limitation of Liability) in these Terms.
5. **Limitations Period.** Except as provided in subsection 3(b)(vii), any written dispute must be brought by you or Windstream within two (2) years after the date the basis for the claim or dispute first arises.

4. Charges for Services and Taxes, Fees, and Surcharges.
--------------------------------------------------------

You are responsible for paying all charges applicable to Services provided to you including, but not limited to, monthly recurring charges (“MRCs”), access charges, features, changes and moves to Services, Service repair visits and no-show charges, installation charges, IP-address charges, billing charges, credit-card surcharges, toll, long distance, and directory assistance, equipment fees, and any other usage-based charges at our current rates when used. Certain offers may include limited-time promotional pricing; at the end of any promotional pricing period, standard rates for the applicable Service(s) will apply and you will be responsible for payment of such increased rates. In addition to the monthly recurring and usage-based charges, other charges (such as taxes, fees, surcharges, and assessments) apply to all Services and Equipment, including how those may change in the future. In certain service areas, paper bills are available for a monthly charge.

To determine whether certain taxes, fees, and surcharges are applicable to Services provided to you, we are required by federal law to obtain your street address, which must be within our service area. You represent and warrant that the address you provide us to obtain Service is correct, and you acknowledge that we are relying on this information to determine which taxes, fees, or surcharges are applicable to your Service. You agree to notify us if your address changes. In the event you do not provide us with a valid address or address change, you may be responsible for additional taxes, fees, surcharges, and penalties associated with failure to pay taxes based on the proper address, and we may terminate your Services.

As a convenience to you, we may include charges for third-party services purchased or ordered using your Windstream Services on your monthly bill. You should always review your bill carefully and contact the Company if you are unsure about a charge on your bill. Company also offers the ability to block such third-party charges from your monthly bill. This Service is optional and free of charge. If you are interested in adding a third-party block to your account, then call a Company representative at the number found at the top-right-hand corner of your statement to determine if your account is eligible. The block does not apply to Services provided by Windstream or its affiliates to which you subscribe.

5. Billing and Payment; Rate Increases.
---------------------------------------

We will bill you the recurring and installation rates you were quoted for Services or those associated with the Services you currently use or previously ordered, with increases on notice. All recurring charges are billed one month in advance. Billing at a location will begin upon the earlier of either (i) the Installation Date (which may be the date administrative access to certain software-based Services are granted to Customer), or (ii) thirty (30) days after delivery of the applicable facility and/or equipment to Customer’s premises (if the delay in connection of the facility and/or equipment is due to Customer or its agent). Company may choose to bill in full monthly increments with no proration for partial service periods when Service either starts or ends in the middle of a billing cycle.

We reserve the right to back-bill you for Services actually used, but not previously billed.

Additionally, you may be enrolled in paperless billing when you subscribe to Windstream Services.  If you have paperless billing, each month we will send an email to your official email address on file with the Company when your invoice is available.  You may review your monthly bill and make a payment, or switch back to a paper bill by changing your billing preference, in the Go Kinetic portal (my.gokinetic.com).  You may also call us at 800-347-1991 to change your billing preference.  Please note that a monthly fee may apply if you choose to receive a paper bill. 

Payment in full is due no later than the due date indicated on your bill and we may apply a late fee, interest, and other charges (including, but not limited to, collection fees) up to the maximum amount permitted by law. Returned checks, payment by phone, paper bills, and other fees due to your choice of payment method or billing receipt may also be subject to fees.

Further, you agree that you may be subject to collections either by Windstream or a third-party collections agency. If Windstream uses a collection agency or commences legal action to recover monies due, to the extent permitted by law, you must reimburse Windstream all expenses incurred to collect amounts you owe us, including attorneys' fees. If your account is referred to third-party collections, you are responsible for payment of any collection fee which will be assessed and due at the time of the referral. Subject to applicable law, you agree that Windstream is not responsible or liable for any negative consequences that may arise as a result of referring your account, payment information, or history to any third-party credit reporting or collections agency.

We may require you to authorize payment for Services by credit card or by debiting a bank account, and no additional notice or consent is required before we invoice the credit card or debit the bank account for all amounts due to us for any reason.

6. Credits, Deposits, and Advanced Payments.
--------------------------------------------

Our agreement to provide you Services is subject to credit approval, and, as such, you authorize us to ask credit-reporting agencies for credit information about you. We may require you to submit an initial deposit and/or an advanced payment or participate in certain payment-related programs, such as automatic payment enrollment, as security for payment of charges. If you decline to participate, or cease participation at any time, in such payment-related programs, or if either the amount/number of Services is increased, you are late on payment or your credit rating changes, an initial or additional deposit or advanced payment may be required. Simple interest will be paid on the cash deposit for the period it is held by us and will be refunded if satisfactory credit has been established or upon termination of Service (if no balance is due). We reserve the right to apply the deposit to any amount due and unpaid, and the payment of a deposit in no way relieves you of paying your bills in a timely manner. Regarding advanced payments, any advanced payment will appear as a credit to your first-month's bill. If you cancel Services before installation, or we cannot install your Services for some reason, then we may refund the advanced payment. We will not refund any advanced payment made after installation of Services.

7. Termination by You.
----------------------

a._Pre-Installation_.  If you are a business customer, and you terminate your order prior to the installation of Services, then you will be required to pay a pre-installation cancellation charge equal to the greater of (i) three (3) months of MRCs; or (ii) our costs to other providers. You agree that this charge is a reasonable measure of the administrative costs and other fees, incurred by us, to prepare for installation.

b._After Installation_.  If you cancel your Services or a portion thereof after installation, then you remain liable for payment of all outstanding charges for all Services you used and Equipment you purchased from us prior to termination. If you terminate Services prior to the last day of your billing cycle, then you will be charged for the full last month of Service with no proration or credit.

c._Fixed-Term Agreements_.  When you purchased your Service(s), you may have been required to commit to a term or a minimum purchase. Either you or we may elect not to renew your service by providing notice to the other no later than thirty (30) days prior to expiration of the fixed term. If neither you nor we deliver a timely notice not to renew, THEN the Services will renew on a month-to-month basis. IF YOU TERMINATE SERVICES AFTER INSTALLATION OR DURING THE INITIAL OR RENEWAL TERM FOR ANY REASON OTHER THAN FOR CAUSE, OR WE TERMINATE FOR CAUSE PURSUANT TO SECTION 7 BELOW, THEN YOU WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY TO US AS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO 100% OF THE MONTHLY RECURRING CHARGES (“MRCS”) MULTIPLIED BY THE NUMBER OF MONTHS REMAINING IN THE THEN CURRENT TERM. IF YOU TERMINATE OR DISCONNECT LESS THAN THE ENTIRETY OF YOUR SERVICES SUCH THAT YOUR ACTUAL USAGE AT A LOCATION FALLS BELOW MINIMUM MONTHLY FEE (“MMF”) FOR THAT LOCATION, THEN YOU AGREE TO PAY AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE MMF FOR EVERY MONTH REMAINING IN THE THEN CURRENT TERM (“LIQUIDATED DAMAGES”).

You agree that in the event of termination by you, the actual damage to Windstream is difficult to ascertain, and that the early termination fee represents liquidated damages, not a penalty, and is a reasonable estimate of the actual reduction in the value of this Agreement that we will sustain.

d._Month-to-Month Agreements_.  If no length of time is identified on the Service Order or you were not otherwise required to commit to a term, then the term is month-to-month, and you or we may terminate at any time by providing notice at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of termination. You remain liable for payment of all outstanding charges for all Services you used and Equipment you purchased from us prior to termination. If you terminate Service prior to the last day of your billing cycle, then you will be charged for the full last month of Service with no proration or credit.

e._Bundled Services_.  Some plans may offer a discount, if you sign up for bundled Services, and may require a term commitment. If you sign up for bundled Services, then you agree to maintain the bundled Services for the applicable term. If you receive bundled Services, and you subsequently unbundle, terminate, or disconnect any of these Services, or we disconnect any of the Services, then we may adjust the rates for the remaining Service(s) to the then current price.

f._Change in Location_.  A change in your service address or location to which any Service is provided to you may constitute, at our sole discretion, termination of the Services or result in an increase in the prices you must pay for the Services.

g._Change to Another Carrier_.  We may deem a request by you to port your numbers as a request by you to terminate your Agreement. If you choose to port less than all your numbers, or you leave any Services connected, then we will continue to bill you for the numbers and/or Services still connected.

8. Termination by Us.
---------------------

Provisioning of the Service is subject to the availability of the requisite equipment and facilities. We may limit, interrupt, suspend, terminate, or refuse to provide a Service if:

* you do not honor any provision of this Agreement;
* you use a Service in an adverse manner that affects Windstream’s network or other customers, you have used a Service fraudulently or unlawfully or are suspected of doing so, or there occurs an event for which Windstream reasonably believes that the suspension or termination of Services is necessary to protect Windstream, its employees or Windstream’s other customers from an imminent and significant operational, physical, financial or security risk, in which case Windstream will provide advance notice if practicable;
* you modify your phone, or any software residing thereon, from the original manufacturer specifications, including for the purpose of accessing non-Windstream services;
* you use a Service in a manner that is excessive or unreasonable when compared to the predominant usage patterns of other customers, on a similar service plan, in your geographic area (and we may, also, implement charges or change you to the appropriate rate plan consistent with such use);
* you resell any Service;
* for any other reason set forth in the relevant tariffs and price lists or terms and conditions;
* you do not pay any amount due to us or billed by us on behalf of others, including disputed amounts that Windstream determines are valid charges on your bills and any deposits or advanced payments that Windstream may require;
* facilities or property associated with providing the Services have been condemned, or use has been prohibited by the government in any manner;
* you fail to acquire and maintain the right-of-way or property access necessary for installation or maintenance of Services;
* you are insolvent, have made an assignment for the benefit of credits, or you have filed or had filed against you a petition for bankruptcy;
* we determine in our sole discretion that facilities are not technically or economically feasible, including if copper or fiber facilities are no longer available to Windstream at reasonable rates or are not available for any reason, including, but not limited to, regulatory changes or retirement of copper plant pursuant to FCC rules;
