*   Like most large-scale websites, we have some rules which you need to stick to when you use Last.fm. These rules aren’t just the “blahblahblah-yawn-small print” – these are the legal terms of use and so we recommend you read them carefully so you know what you’ve agreed to.
*   As with all websites, Last.fm, its services and software will change over time, both in terms of the content displayed and the functionality offered. We reserve the right to make those changes, and to change these terms in line with them. Software made available for download by Last.fm remains the property of Last.fm, and we reserve the right to update and change that too.
*   Please don’t reproduce any part of the website or content without our permission.
*   A lot of information and content on Last.fm is provided by third parties – both users and other third parties – and the accuracy and reliability of that information is entirely the responsibility of those parties.
