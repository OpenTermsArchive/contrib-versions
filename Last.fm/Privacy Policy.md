INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
-----------------------

Paramount is a global company that may transfer your personal information to a country (including the United States) that does not provide the same level of protection for your personal information. Paramount may transfer your personal information to the [Paramount Skydance Family of Companies](https://privacy.paramount.com/en/controllers-list), carefully selected service providers, business partners, and other third parties for the purposes described in this policy.

Whenever we transfer your personal information within the Paramount Skydance Family of Companies and to our service providers, business partners, and other third parties, we look at the risks to your information and rely on safeguards, where applicable, to ensure your rights are protected. For instance, we have put in place standard contractual clauses approved under data protection laws in Argentina, the EEA, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom to facilitate transfers to the United States.

CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
------------------

The Paramount Services covered by this privacy policy are generally not intended for use by children. Instead, our child-directed Paramount Services, including our policies around parental consent, are covered by our [Children’s Privacy Policy](https://privacy.paramount.com/en/childrens). In channels available through our general audience Paramount Services, or in areas of those Paramount Services that are directed to children, we collect only a limited amount of personal information, as permitted by law. Specifically, we may collect IP addresses, device identifiers, certain unique ID numbers, and limited viewing information. We do not use (or allow our partners to use) this information, other than for the purposes of supporting our internal operations, such as to provide children with access to features and activities on the services, to customize content and improve our services, to serve contextual advertising, or limit how often a particular advertisement is seen.

RETENTION
---------

We will retain your personal information for the time period reasonably necessary to achieve the purposes described in this privacy policy, or any other notice provided at the time of collection unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by applicable law.

We determine how long to retain information based on the purposes for which it was collected, its sensitivity, our legal obligations, and the purposes set out in this privacy policy. For example, we retain your registration information for the duration of your relationship with us. Once our relationship ends, we retain certain records (including your email address and details about your transactions) for an additional period of time to comply with our legal obligations in certain jurisdictions and to prevent fraud. If you submit a request to exercise one of your privacy rights, we retain records of those requests so that we can comply with them (for example, so that we remember your request to opt out of marketing messages) and so that we can demonstrate that we have complied. In each case, we determine how long to retain information based on how long it is needed to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected, whether we need to retain it for an additional window to comply with record-keeping obligations or to defend against legal claims or prevent fraud.

COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES
---------------------------------------

We may automatically receive certain information about you and your device using browser- or device-based tracking technologies described below.

On our child-directed services, we do not use (or allow our partners to use) automatically-collected information, such as IP addresses, cookie identifiers, and other device identifiers, other than to support our internal operations, which include the following:

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION US STATES
--------------------------------

Depending on where you reside, there are additional disclosures and certain additional rights regarding your personal information, as described below. The rights available to you will depend on the laws in the state where you live.

### SHARING (FOR CROSS-CONTEXT BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING), SALE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION, AND PROCESSING FOR PURPOSES OF TARGETED ADVERTISING

Certain disclosures of information that we make to third parties or purposes for which we use information we receive from third parties constitute the “sale” of your personal information, “sharing” of your personal information (for “cross-context behavioral advertising” purposes), or “processing” of your personal information for purposes of “targeted advertising” under applicable laws. For instance, some of our brands disclose certain device identifiers and advertising identifiers associated with your mobile or connected device to advertising partners. Those partners use and share those identifiers to show you advertisements that are targeted to your interests on third-party sites and services. We also receive information from third parties, which we use to help inform which ads to show you on the Paramount Services.

Where a brand does this or otherwise “sells” your personal information, we will give you the opportunity to opt out by clicking the “Your Privacy Choices” link on the footer of the relevant website, or in the settings menu of the relevant mobile or online application, or other service.

The following types of personal information may be processed for purposes of targeted advertising, and may have been “shared” or “sold” in the 12-month period prior to the last modified date of the privacy policy:

* **Registration Information and Online Identifiers**: Names and aliases; email address; IP address; unique identifiers
* **Commercial information**: Information about transactions or content choices made on or in connection with the Paramount Services
* **Online Activities and Preferences**: Information related to your preferences, attitudes, online behaviors, demographics, product and ad choices, and preferences
* **Location data**: Information related to your location, including your IP address
* **Social Media Information**: Social media statuses and updates, pictures, and references to your online presence

Each category of personal information listed above is “shared” with or “sold” to the following third parties to help us target and deliver personalized ads to you on the Paramount Services and Third-Party Services as described in this policy:

* **Business partners** (e.g., marketing companies, sponsors working with us on co-branded promotions)
* **Advertisers and other advertising partners** (e.g., agencies, publishers, and advertising networks)
* **Social media companies**
* **Parties to a corporate transaction** (e.g., if we are involved in the purchase, sale, lease, or other acquisition of our systems containing personal information)

We do not have actual knowledge that we “sell” or “share” personal information of individuals under the age of 16.

**Do Not Track**. Our websites and apps are not designed to respond to “do not track” requests from browsers.

### DEIDENTIFIED INFORMATION

To the extent we process deidentified information, we will maintain and use the information in deidentified form and will not attempt to reidentify the information unless permitted by applicable law.

### SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION

In the U.S., there may be instances where we process information that is considered “sensitive personal information”. We use sensitive personal information only when permitted by applicable laws – specifically, to provide you with the Paramount Services, to perform analytics on the Paramount Services, to serve you targeted advertising, and to comply with our legal obligations.

### YOUR U.S. PRIVACY RIGHTS

In certain U.S. States, in addition to the rights described in the **Your Choices, Rights, and Controls** section of this Privacy Policy, you also have the following rights:

* **Opt out of Sale/Sharing/Targeted Advertising**. You have the right to opt out of the processing of your personal information for purposes of targeted advertising, and the sale or sharing (for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes) of your personal information. Note that if you submit an opt-out request, you will still see ads on our services, though they might be less relevant to you. These ads may be based on historical information or information “shared” or “sold” by other sources. Please note that, when you use these tools on our services, you may need to renew your choices each time you clear your cookies or use a new browser or device. You may also need to make this choice separately for some of our services. You also can update your browser settings to make certain choices about third-party cookies.
* **Non-discrimination**. We will not discriminate against you based on your exercise of any of the rights described above.
* **Appeal**. If you have any unresolved privacy concerns that we have not addressed satisfactorily after contacting us, you may have the right to appeal our decision by responding directly in your request or by opening a new request and selecting ‘General Privacy Request’ and indicating that you are appealing our response to your previous request.

In those states where it is applicable, you or your authorized agent may submit a request to exercise any of the above rights by visiting our [Privacy Rights Center](https://privacy.paramount.com/privacyrightscenter) or by calling us at (888) 841-3343. To opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information, or our processing of your personal information for purposes of targeted advertising, click on the Your Privacy Choices link in the footer of the relevant websites or in the settings menu of the relevant mobile or online applications. Note that your choice to opt out is device- or browser-specific and you will need to manage your preferences for each device or browser you use. You may also need to make this choice separately on different Paramount Services.

In those states where it is required, if you have enabled the Global Privacy Control signal, we will treat this as a request to opt out of “sales”, “sharing” and “targeted advertising” for device information. Note that we do not associate your browser or device information with your name, email address, and other direct identifiers. If you would like to opt out of the use of this information for “sales”, “sharing” and “targeted advertising”, please visit our Privacy Rights Center linked above. For more information about how to use the Global Privacy Control signal, please see [here](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/).
