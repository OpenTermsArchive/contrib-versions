INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
-----------------------

Paramount is a global company that may transfer your personal information to a country (including the United States) that does not provide the same level of protection for your personal information. Paramount may transfer your personal information to the [Paramount family of companies](https://privacy.paramount.com/en/controllers-list), carefully selected service providers, business partners, and other third parties for the purposes described in this policy.

Whenever we transfer your personal information, we look at the risks to your information and rely on safeguards like standard contractual clauses, where applicable, to ensure your rights are protected. If we share personal information with a third party, we will require them to protect your personal information appropriately.

CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
------------------

The services covered by this privacy policy are generally not intended for use by children. Instead, our child-directed services are covered by our [Children’s Privacy Policy](https://privacy.paramount.com/childrens). If channels available through our general audience services, or in areas of those services that are directed to children, we collect only a limited amount of personal information, as permitted by law. Specifically, we may collect IP addresses, device identifiers, certain unique ID numbers, and limited viewing information. We do not use (or allow our partners to use) this information, other than for the purposes of supporting our internal operations, such as to provide children with access to features and activities on the services, to customize content and improve our services, to serve contextual advertising, or limit how often a particular advertisement is seen. We do not allow interest-based advertising on portions of our services that are directed to children or where we know that the user is a child or teen under 16.

RETENTION
---------

We will retain your personal information for the time period reasonably necessary to achieve the purposes described in this privacy policy, or any other notice provided at the time of collection unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by applicable law, taking into account applicable statutes of limitation and our records retention requirements and policies.

COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES
---------------------------------------

We may automatically receive certain information about you and your device using browser- or device-based tracking technologies described below. These technologies allow us to ensure our services are functioning correctly, improve our services, provide and measure advertisements, and provide personalized content to you.

You can manage how these tracking technologies are used by adjusting your device or browser settings and, in some countries, by selecting your preferences in a consent management solution. In some cases, you can opt out of tracking by our analytics providers by visiting their opt-out pages directly.

### TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES AND PURPOSES

* **Cookies**: Cookies are small data files stored on your browser or device. They may be served by the entity that operates the website you are visiting (“first-party cookies”) or by other companies (“third-party cookies”).
    
* **Pixels**: Pixels are small images on a web page or in an email. Pixels collect information about your browser or device and can set cookies on your browser.
    
* **Local Storage**: Local storage allows data about your browser or device to be stored locally on your browser or device and includes HTML5 local storage and browser cache.
    
* **SDKs**: SDKs (also known as “software development kits”) are blocks of code, typically provided by our partners, that may be installed in our applications. SDKs may help us understand how you interact with our applications and may collect information about the device and network you use to access our applications, such as the advertising ID associated with your device or information about how you interact with our applications.
    

The purposes for which we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies generally fall into the following categories:

* **Strictly Necessary:** Examples include carrying out or facilitating the transmission of communications over a network, and technologies that are strictly necessary to provide an online service (e.g., our website or a service on our website).
    
* **Functional:** Examples include helping ensure our services function correctly, remembering your settings and preferences (such as your language preferences), helping to identify and prevent security risks, or helping us understand and improve our services.
    
* **Performance:** Examples include collecting information about how you interact with our services and personalizing content for you.
    
* **Targeting:** Examples include making advertising more relevant and meaningful to you. These may also include “social cookies,” which enable you to share content with your friends on social media platforms, such as Facebook or Twitter.
    

On our child-directed services, we do not use (or allow our partners to use) automatically-collected information, such as IP addresses, cookie identifiers, and other device identifiers, other than to support our internal operations, which include the following:

* Providing children with access to features and activities on those services.
    
* Customizing content and improve those services.
    
* Serve contextual advertising and limiting how often you or your child see a particular advertisement on those services.
    

### MANAGING COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES

### Consent management solution

Depending on where you live, you can manage your preferences via our consent management solution on the relevant mobile or online application. Please note that when you use these tools, you need to renew your choices each time you clear your cookies, use a new browser or device, or visit a different Paramount service.

### Browser controls

Although most browsers and devices accept cookies by default, their settings usually allow you to clear and decline cookies. Web browsers often store your preferences in a cookie. Blocking cookies may prevent the services from operating as expected and may also prevent storing your preferences and choices.

Below are links to the cookie opt-out pages of common web browsers. If your web browser is not listed here, you should review your web browser terms to learn more about your cookie choices.

### Interest-based advertising

We, our service providers, business partners, and other third parties may use interest-based advertising. This means that we may collect information about you on our services and on third-party services to help serve advertising relevant to your interests across your devices, browsers, and on and off our services. For more information on the choices that may be available to you to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising, please visit:

You can also opt out of interest-based advertising with some of the third-party partners we use, such as Google ([https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated)). Please note that if you opt out of interest-based advertising, some information will still be collected for other purposes, such as research, analytics, and internal operations. You will also continue to receive contextual advertisements, but they may be less relevant to your interests.

On many mobile devices, you can manage interest-based advertising through your device’s settings. These options can include resetting your device’s advertising ID or selecting “Limit Ad Tracking” (for iOS devices) or “Opt out of Ads Personalization” (for Android devices) in your device settings.

Connected devices (such as tablets, connected TVs, set top boxes, streaming devices, and gaming consoles) may also use an advertising ID or other methods to identify you or serve you interest-based advertising. In some cases, you can disable tracking by selecting options like “limit ad tracking” or disabling options like “interest-based advertising” in your connected device’s settings. These options will vary by device and we do not control the policies or practices of third parties providing these devices.

Please note that your choice to opt out is device- or browser-specific and you will need to manage your preferences for each device or browser you use. You may also need to make this choice separately on different Paramount services. For additional information on exercising your privacy rights, please see [“Your choices, rights, and controls”](#your-choices-rights-and-controls).

For additional information about the rights that may be available to you if you live in the United States, please see “[Additional Information: US States](#additional-information-us-states)”.

INFORMATION ABOUT THE SHARING (FOR CROSS-CONTEXT BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING) OR SALE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some information that we disclose to third parties may constitute the “sale” of your personal information or “sharing” of your personal information (for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes) under applicable laws. For instance, some of our brands disclose certain device identifiers and advertising identifiers associated with your mobile or internet-connected device to advertising partners. Those partners use and share those identifiers to show advertisements that are targeted to your interests.

Where a brand does this or otherwise “sells” your personal information, we will give you the opportunity to opt out by clicking the ‘Your Privacy Choices’ link on the footer of the relevant website, or in the settings menu of the relevant mobile or online application, or other service. If you submit an opt-out request, you will still see ads on our services, though they might be less relevant to you. These ads may be based on historical information or information “shared” or “sold” by other sources. Please note that, when you use these tools on our services, you may need to renew your choices each time you clear your cookies or use a new browser or device. You may also need to make this choice separately for some of our services. You also can update your browser settings to make certain choices about third-party cookies.

The following types of personal information may be “shared” with or “sold” to (and may have been “shared” with or “sold” to in the 12-month period prior to the last modified date of the privacy policy) advertising partners, analytics providers, and marketing partners:

* **Identifiers:** Names and aliases; email address; IP address; unique identifier.
    
* **Commercial information:** Information about transactions or content choices made on or in connection with our services.
    
* **Inferences drawn from your personal information:** Information related to your preferences, attitudes, online behaviors, demographics, and product and ad choices, and preferences.
    
* **Geolocation data:** Information related to your location, including your IP address.
    
* **Internet / electronic activity:** Information collected through cookies and web beacons; device attributes; customer preferences and attributes, such as likes, interests, social media statuses and updates, pictures, and references to your online presence.
    

We do not have actual knowledge that we “sell” or “share” personal information of individuals under the age of 16.

**Do Not Track**. Our websites and apps are not designed to respond to “do not track” requests from browsers.

**“Shine the Light” and “Eraser” Laws**. Residents of the State of California may request a list of all third parties to whom we have disclosed certain information during the preceding year for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes.

If you are a California resident under the age of 18 and a registered user of a service where this policy is posted, you may request removal of content or information you have publicly posted. Please be aware that such a request does not ensure complete removal from the internet of the content or information you posted, and there may be circumstances in which the law does not require or allow removal. For all requests under the “Shine the Light” or “Eraser” Law, please visit our [Privacy Rights Center](http://privacy.paramount.com/privacyrightscenter) and complete the form relevant to your relationship with Paramount and select ‘California’ as your state. We will only accept requests to exercise these rights through this mechanism.
