Google Chat acceptable use policy
=================================

**Last updated:** 11 September 2025

These policies apply to Google Chat ('Chat'). When applying these policies, we may make exceptions based on educational, documentary, scientific or artistic considerations, or where there are other substantial benefits to the users of the service. Make sure that you check back from time to time, as these policies may change. [Learn how to block users in Chat](https://support.google.com/chat/answer/9277792). Please also refer to [Google's Terms of Service](https://www.google.com/policies/terms/) for more information.

Child safety
------------

Do not create, upload or distribute content that exploits or abuses children. This includes all child sexual abuse material. To report content on a Google product that may exploit a child, click [Report abuse](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/2463296). If you find content elsewhere on the Internet, please contact [the appropriate agency in your country](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/148666).

More broadly, Google prohibits the use of our products to endanger children. This includes, but is not limited to, predatory behaviour towards children such as:

*   Child grooming: For example, befriending a child online to facilitate, either online or offline, sexual contact and/or exchanging sexual imagery with that child
*   Sextortion: For example, threatening or blackmailing a child by using real or alleged access to a child's intimate images
*   Sexualisation of a minor: For example, imagery that depicts, encourages or promotes the sexual abuse of children or the portrayal of children in a manner that could result in the sexual exploitation of children
*   Trafficking of a child: For example, advertising or soliciting a child for commercial sexual exploitation

If we become aware of such content, we will remove such content and take appropriate action, which may include reporting to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, limiting access to product features and disabling accounts. If you believe that a child is in danger of or has been subject to abuse, exploitation or trafficking, contact the police immediately. If you have already made a report to the police and still need help, or you have concerns a child is being or was being endangered on our products, you can [report the behaviour to Google](https://support.google.com/families/contact/report_child_grooming).

Dangerous and illegal activities
--------------------------------

Do not use Chat to engage in illegal activities, or to promote activities, goods, services or information that cause serious and immediate harm to people or animals. While we permit general information for educational, documentary, scientific or artistic purposes about this content, we draw the line when the content directly facilitates harm or encourages illegal activity. We will take appropriate action if we are notified of unlawful activities, which may include reporting you to the relevant authorities, removing access to some of our products or disabling your Google Account.

Deceptive practices, fraud and scams
------------------------------------

Do not deceive, mislead or confuse users for financial gain or personal harm. This includes providing instructions on, recruiting for or facilitating scams and fraud.

Harassment, bullying and threats

Bear in mind that online harassment is illegal in many places and can have serious offline consequences for both the harasser and the target. We may take appropriate action if we are notified of threats of harm or other dangerous situations, which may include reporting you to the relevant authorities, removing access to some of our products or disabling your Google Account.

Hate speech

Don't engage in hate speech. Hate speech is content that promotes or condones violence against or has the primary purpose of inciting hatred against an individual or group on the basis of their race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, age, nationality, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or any other characteristic that is associated with systemic discrimination or marginalisation.

Impersonation and misrepresentation of identity

Do not impersonate a person or organisation or misrepresent yourself. This includes impersonating any person or organisations that you don't represent; or providing misleading information about a user/site's identity, qualifications, ownership, purpose, products, services or business.

This also includes content or accounts misrepresenting or concealing their ownership or primary purpose, such as misrepresenting or intentionally concealing your country of origin or other material details about yourself when directing content about politics, social issues or matters of public concern to users in a country other than your own.

Malware and similar malicious content
-------------------------------------

Do not transmit malware or any content that harms or interferes with the operation of the networks, servers, end-user devices or other infrastructure. This includes the direct hosting, embedding or transmission of malware, viruses, destructive code or other harmful or unwanted software or similar content.

Personal and confidential information
-------------------------------------

Do not share or distribute other people's personal or confidential information without their authorisation. â€‹This includes the use of sensitive information, such as US Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, credit card numbers, images of signatures and personal health documents. In most cases where this information is broadly available elsewhere on the Internet or in public records, like national ID numbers listed on a government website, we generally don't take action.
