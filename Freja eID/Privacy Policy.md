**1.2** You have registered as a user of the Service according to the Terms of Use for the Service. This Privacy Policy constitutes an integral part of the Terms of Use.

**1.3** You should always feel secure when providing personal data to us. This Privacy Policy is designed to show you how your personal data is processed securely in accordance with applicable legislation.

**1.4** When the Service is used, several parties can be involved. This Privacy Policy only applies in relation to the processing performed by Freja eID Group in its capacity as data controller. Therefore, Freja eID Group recommends that you also read the privacy policies of the other parties who may be involved in the use of the Service, for example, the parties who provide the services on which you can use your Freja eID.

**1.5** In addition to the requirements set forth in the Terms of Use, you must also accept this Privacy Policy in order to use the Service. When we process your data based on your consent, you always have the right to withdraw your consent without this affecting your options to use the Service in other ways.

### 2\. Personal Data Controller and Data Protection Officer

**2.1** Freja eID Group is the data controller for Freja eID Group’s processing of your personal data, and is responsible for ensuring that the processing is performed in accordance with applicable legislation.

**2.2** To the extent that the Service relates to an employment ID or Organisation eID, the organisation is the personal data controller for the data they are responsible for about you in your role. For example, this can be in your role as an employee, customer or as member in an organisation. In these cases, Freja eID is the personal data processor.

**2.3** Freja eID Group has appointed Mr. Tony Buss as the Data Privacy Officer (“Data Privacy Officer”). The Data Privacy Officer’s duty is also to monitor that Freja eID Group processes personal data in accordance with applicable legislation. Contact information for the Data Protection Officer is gdpr@frejaeid.se. +46 8 5272 7984.

### 3\. How We Process Your Personal Data

**3.1** Freja eID Group will process your personal data for the following purposes and for the following legal reasons.

**3.2** You can withdraw your consent regarding Freja at any time, in accordance with point 1.5, by notifying Freja eID Group in written form.

**3.3** Freja eID Group shall not process your personal information for automated decision-making or profiling.

**3.4** In addition to accepting the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, you can choose to give consent for certain personal data processing as described below. The legal basis for us to process this data will be your explicit consent.

In other cases, where for example you are expected by an employer to use your Freja eID as a work tool, we will instead process your personal data as a personal data processor on behalf your employer, and the legal basis for processing will then be your employment contract with the employer. The legal basis for certain processing in the service is shown below.

If you start with only using Freja as an Organisation ID or employee ID and later start using Freja for other purposes, then Freja will be both a personal data processor and a personal data controller, depending on if you are using a service connected to your employer or a private service. For the private services, the legal basis applies as shown below.

**3.5** Freja is available at different trust levels (Basic, Added ID document and Plus). You will be able to see what trust level you are in the mobile application. If you try to access a service at a higher level than you have, you will need to upgrade to the corresponding level in order to access that service.

**Freja eID Basic**

For access to services that do not require your identity to be verified and only requires an email address.

**Freja eID with an added ID document and Freja eID+**

Some services require that your identity be verified when you use Freja to access their services or when you make electronic signatures with them.

In addition to the information processed for Freja Basic, the sections “Freja with an added ID document” and “Freja eID+” apply. Freja eID+ is issued get after you have done an extra validation of your identity through a physical ID check at an Freja eID agent, or have had your identity verified by using a biometric ID document during registration.

**3.6** Below you will find how we process personal data at different trust levels, from lowest (Basic) to highest (Plus). Information collected at a lower trust level is also processed at a higher trust level.

**3.7 Processing your ID photo**

The ID photo you take in when registering with Freja is used for strong verification of your identity and is compared with the portrait image on your ID document. The ID photo can also be used to validate your identity in situations where this can be considered to increase the security of the identification such as when you wish to reset your PIN in Freja or add an extra layer of security. This is done on your initiative and with your explicit consent each time. Your ID photo image can also be used if you want to reset Freja on a new device. The ID photo you took when registering may be shared with your express consent.

Your ID photo is also used in the digital ID-card of Freja and exposed to a controller when you show it to such a person. The opening of the ID-card is dependent on you entering your Freja PIN (or generate PIN via biometrics if you have this activated). From the ID-card the image along with other personal data (see table) can be shared to a controller via the QR-code. The ID-photo can also be shared to a controller via the Share your data feature from the home screen.

**3.8 Age and Handling of Minors’ Personal Data**

The service is available for individuals from the age of five. Parental consent is required for individuals under 13 years old.

Parents of children under five years old can use Freja for certain e-services to read and send the child’s passport information to, for example, a government authority.

**3.9 Country-Specific Information**

Freja can be used to create an e-ID from a large number of countries, and a current list of supported countries is [available here](https://org.frejaeid.com/en/an-e-id-for-foreign-citizens/).

The processing of personal data, as specified in section 3.6, is the same for all these countries, but there are local variations in how personal identity numbers are defined, and some countries do not have personal identity numbers at all. The data contained in passports may also vary between countries, and Freja reads the data available in the passport’s data fields. No such data is shared without the user’s explicit consent.

For users with a Swedish personal identity number or a verified coordination number, personal data is cross-checked against SPAR (the National Address Register).

For users obtaining Freja Plus with a driver’s license or an ID card issued by the Swedish Tax Agency, a physical ID verification is required at a store that acts as an agent for ATG (Aktiebolaget Trav och Galopp), which handles some of your personal data during the ID verification process.

### 4\. How Long Your Personal Data Is Stored

**4.1** Your personal data is stored as long as is needed to fulfil the objectives that require the data to be collected in accordance with this Privacy Policy and to comply with laws and regulatory requirements.
