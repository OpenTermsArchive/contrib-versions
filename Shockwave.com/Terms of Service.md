We take great care and pride in creating this Site. We are always on the lookout for technical glitches that effect how the Site works. When we find them on our end, we will fix them. Unfortunately, your home computer may cause some glitches that effect how you see our Site -- and that is beyond our control.

If you experience any unusual behavior, content or ads on the Site, it may be the result of Malware on your computer. Malware -- short for Malicious software -- is a term used to broadly classify a form of software which is installed in a computer system with malicious intentions, usually without the owner's knowledge or permission. Malware includes computer viruses, key loggers, malicious active content, rogue programs and dialers, among others. While we continuously work closely with our partners to ensure that everything on the Site is working properly, sometimes Malware programs on your personal computer may interfere with your experience on our Site and on other sites that you visit.

We suggest that you take some of the following actions which may help to clean your computer and which could prevent future installations of Malware.

*   Update your computer via Windows Update (found in the Tools menu in your Internet Explorer web browser).
*   Install a SpyWare Removal Tool such as [**Spybot Search and Destroy**](https://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html) or [**AdAware**](http://www.lavasoft.com/?domain=lavasoftusa.com) to clean your computer of Malware.
*   Install antivirus software, such as [**Norton anti-virus**](https://www.symantec.com/norton/products/index.jsp) or [**McAfee Virus-shield**](https://us.mcafee.com/).
*   Install [**Microsoft Defender**](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/defender/default.mspx) (for Windows computers).

Please note that we cannot be responsible for the effects of any third-party software including Malware on your computer system. Please make sure to carefully read the Help or Customer Support areas of any software download site.

If you do discover any Malware on your system, we also suggest you speak with a qualified computer technician. If, after taking the above actions, you are still experiencing any problems, please feel free to [**contact us**](https://www.shockwave.com/help/contact_us.jsp).

Trophies have no monetary value and can only be used to participate in activities within the Site. As a guest to the Site you do not own your account, activities, Tokens or Trophies; they are for you to only use and play with while on the Site. Except as permitted by the functionality of this Site, you can't sell Tokens or Trophies or give them to anyone, trade them for anything (including Tokens), or pretend you made them. This means that you cannot try to make money off the Tokens, Trophies, or virtual items in your account or even sell the time it took you to collect such items and Tokens. If we find someone selling Tokens, Trophies, or other virtual items, we will freeze every account controlled by that user and every account of the user who purchased such Tokens, Trophies or virtual items.

You acknowledge and agree that you are not permitted under any circumstances or for any reason to cheat or utilize third-party games or code in order to win at, or gain Tokens or Trophies from any game or activity on the Site.
