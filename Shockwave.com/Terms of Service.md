### Terms of Use Agreement

**THESE TERMS OF USE DESCRIBE YOUR RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES SO PLEASE READ THEM CAREFULLY**

This is the official Terms of Use Agreement ("Agreement") for Shockwave.com ("Shockwave", "Site," "we," "us," or "our"), an Internet website owned and operated by Addicting Games, Inc. ("AG"). This Agreement governs only the content, software, features, and activities related to this Site and does not cover websites for any other AG programming channel, or any subsidiaries or affiliates of AG (collectively, "Affiliates"), or any other company, unless specifically stated.

AG operates and controls the Site from its offices in New York, NY, in the United States of America. We make no representation that the Site is appropriate or available in other locations. Accordingly, those persons accessing the Site from other locations do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws.

Thus, no software from this Site may be downloaded, exported or re-exported (a) into (or to a national or resident of) Cuba, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Iran, Syria, or any other country to which the United States has embargoed goods; or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Deny Orders. By downloading any software, you represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of, any such country or on any such list.

These terms and conditions regarding your use of the Site constitute a legally binding agreement between you and AG. In this Agreement, the term "Site" includes all websites and web pages within the Site as well as any equivalent, mirror, replacement, substitute or backup websites and web pages that are associated with the Site and also includes all software and Applications (as defined in Section 10 of this Agreement) made available through the Site. Your use of the site constitutes your acknowledgement of, and agreement to, abide by the terms of this Agreement and any additional terms that govern certain products and services, such as subscription services and e-commerce services ("Services"), which will be presented in conjunction with those products and services ("Additional Terms"), including the Shockwave [**User Submission Agreement**](http://www.shockwave.com/about/submissionAgreement.jsp) (governing your submission of User Material (as such term is defined therein), the [**Virtual Currency Purchasing Agreement**](http://www.shockwave.com/about/virtualCurrencyAgreement.jsp) (governing purchases of/with Virtual Currencies), and/or any rules of participation ("Rules") presented with certain activities and services including, but not limited to, contests and sweepstakes, and award programs.

The Site's Additional Terms, the [**Privacy Policy**](http://www.shockwave.com/about/privacyPolicy.jsp) and/or the Rules, when applicable, are hereby incorporated into this Agreement by reference. To the extent a conflict exists between this Agreement and any applicable Additional Terms or Rules, the Additional Terms or Rules shall govern. This Agreement will remain in full force and effect as long as you are a user of the Site and in the event of termination of any membership, Service or feature, you will still be bound by your obligations under this Agreement, the [**Privacy Policy**](http://www.shockwave.com/about/privacyPolicy.jsp), any Additional Terms or Rules, including any indemnifications, warranties and limitations of liability.

The words "use" and/or "using" in this Agreement mean any time an individual (a "user"), directly or indirectly, with or without the aid of a machine or device, does or attempts to access, interact with, use, display, view, print or copy from the Site, transmit, receive or exchange data or communicate with the Site, or in any way utilizes, benefits, takes advantage of or interacts with any function, Service or feature of the Site, for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement does not cover your rights or responsibilities with respect to third party content or sites or any links that may direct your browser or your connection to third party sites or pages. This is the entire and exclusive Agreement between you and us regarding your use of the Site and it cannot be modified, except as specifically described below in Section 5.

**1\. REGISTRATION AND USE OF PASSWORD**

We may require each user to have a unique user name and password combination in order to use the Site and may also, from time to time, provide users with additional codes or passwords necessary to access and use certain features or functions of the Site. Please read our [**Privacy Policy**](http://www.shockwave.com/about/privacyPolicy.jsp), which describes the personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") we collect, use, disclose, manage and store. As part of the registration process, you will choose a user name and password (or we may assign an initial password which we will give you the option to change). For users that choose to access Shockwave UNLIMITED with prizes via an [**alternate means of entry**](http://www.shockwave.com/tokenCentral/rules.jsp#entryLink) (if any), we will assign a user name and password. Your user name and password are personal to you and you may not allow any others to use them under any circumstances. We are not liable for any harm caused or related to the theft or misappropriation of, disclosure, or your authorizing anyone else to use your user name or password. You agree to notify us immediately if you become aware of or believe there is or may have been any unauthorized use of your user name or password or any other need to deactivate your user name or password due to security concerns.

PASSWORDS ARE ISSUED ON A PERSONAL BASIS. ACCORDINGLY, ALL CONTENT OR INSTRUCTIONS TRANSMITTED BY OR RECEIVED FROM ANYONE PRESENTING YOUR PASSWORD ON THE SITE WILL BE DEEMED BINDING ON YOU. You agree that you are solely responsible and liable for all actions taken via your password, whether or not made with your knowledge or authority. You agree to guard your password carefully, with the full awareness that a failure to keep it secure will enable others to engage in transactions through the Site for which you will be legally responsible.

In consideration of your use of the Site (and/or software or Services purchased through the Site) you agree to provide true, accurate and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Site registration or ordering process, provided that in connection with registration, you do not need to, and should not, use your full or true name for your screen name or username. Additionally, you represent that you are of legal age to form a binding contract and you agree to update information provided in connection with registration or the ordering process in order to maintain its truth, accuracy and completeness.

If you provide information that we believe to be inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, or if you select a username that we in our sole discretion find offensive or inappropriate, we have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Site.

**2\. GAME DOWNLOAD PAYMENTS AND SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS AND CONSENT TO CREDIT CARD AUTHORIZATION**

All refund requests for purchased game downloads must be received within 48 hours from the time of purchase. Refund requests past 48 hours from time of purchase will not be honored.

You are responsible and liable for any fees, including attorney and collection fees, that the Site may incur in its efforts to collect any remaining balances from you. You also agree that you will be billed for and will pay any outstanding commitment remaining on your subscription or other purchase if you cancel or terminate the Service or any portion thereof.

If you do not bring them to our attention within 90 days, you agree that you waive your right to dispute such problems or discrepancies.

You may cancel a subscription Service at any time prior to the end of your subscription period. You will not receive any refund or partial refund for any charges already billed to your account.

You may [**contact us**](http://www.shockwave.com/help/contact_us.jsp) with questions regarding your subscription or if you wish to cancel. You understand and agree that cancellation of the Service is your sole right and remedy for any dispute with respect to the Site. This includes, but is not limited to, any dispute related to, or arising out of: (1) any term of this Agreement or our enforcement or application of this Agreement; (2) any policy or practice of the Site, including any [Privacy Policy](http://www.shockwave.com/about/privacyPolicy.jsp), or the Site's enforcement or application of these policies; (3) your ability to access and/or use any Service; (4) any Site software, application, feature, or content provided by or through the Site; or (5) the amount or type of fees, applicable taxes, billing methods, or any change to the fees, applicable taxes, or billing methods.

Please see Shockwave's subscription [**cancellation policy**](http://www.shockwave.com/help/cancelPolicy.jsp) for more information on the cancellation of subscription Services which is incorporated by reference to this Agreement.

**15\. ADS AND MALWARE**

We take great care and pride in creating this Site. We are always on the lookout for technical glitches that effect how the Site works. When we find them on our end, we will fix them. Unfortunately, your home computer may cause some glitches that effect how you see our Site -- and that is beyond our control.

If you experience any unusual behavior, content or ads on the Site, it may be the result of Malware on your computer. Malware -- short for MALicious softWARE -- is a term used to broadly classify a form of software which is installed in a computer system with malicious intentions, usually without the owner's knowledge or permission. Malware includes computer viruses, key loggers, malicious active content, rogue programs and dialers, among others. While we continuously work closely with our partners to ensure that everything on the Site is working properly, sometimes Malware programs on your personal computer may interfere with your experience on our Site and on other sites that you visit.

We suggest that you take some of the following actions which may help to clean your computer and which could prevent future installations of Malware.

*   Update your computer via Windows Update (found in the Tools menu in your Internet Explorer web browser).
*   Install a SpyWare Removal Tool such as [**Spybot Search and Destroy**](http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html) or [**AdAware**](http://www.lavasoft.com/?domain=lavasoftusa.com) to clean your computer of Malware.
*   Install antivirus software, such as [**Norton anti-virus**](http://www.symantec.com/norton/products/index.jsp) or [**McAfee Virus-shield**](http://us.mcafee.com/).
*   Install [**Microsoft Defender**](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/defender/default.mspx) (for Windows computers).

Please note that we cannot be responsible for the effects of any third-party software including Malware on your computer system. Please make sure to carefully read the Help or Customer Support areas of any software download site.

If you do discover any Malware on your system, we also suggest you speak with a qualified computer technician. If, after taking the above actions, you are still experiencing any problems, please feel free to [**contact us**](http://www.shockwave.com/help/contact_us.jsp).

**16\. TOKENS AND TROPHIES**

The Site may offer users points ("Tokens") for participating in certain Site activities such as achieving certain game scores, playing certain games, etc. The Site may also offer to users who have completed or excelled at specified Site activities or games trophies, virtual awards or achievement symbols ("Trophies"). Trophies have no monetary value and can only be used to participate in activities within the Site. As a guest to the Site you do not own your account, activities, Tokens or Trophies; they are for you to only use and play with while on the Site. Except as permitted by the functionality of this Site, you can't sell Tokens or Trophies or give them to anyone, trade them for anything (including Tokens), or pretend you made them. This means that you cannot try to make money off the Tokens, Trophies, or virtual items in your account or even sell the time it took you to collect such items and Tokens. If we find someone selling Tokens, Trophies, or other virtual items, we will freeze every account controlled by that user and every account of the user who purchased such Tokens, Trophies or virtual items.

You acknowledge and agree that you are not permitted under any circumstances or for any reason to cheat or utilize third-party games or code in order to win at, or gain Tokens or Trophies from any game or activity on the Site. You agree not to design, disseminate or use any third party programs designed to change the game play or Token or Trophy providing activities on the site including, but without limitations, programs such as autobuyers, flash game cheats, autofreshers, and snipers. Any use, dissemination or design of such programs is a breach of this Agreement and you will be responsible for any resulting damages to the Site. **You agree that if you disseminate, design or assist in the design of a third party program that changes the game play or activities on the Site thus affecting the accumulation of Tokens or Trophies, you will pay AG liquidated damages in the sum of Fifty Thousand Dollars for each such program. You agree that if you use such a program on the Site, you will pay AG liquidated damages in the sum of Five Hundred Dollars for each time you use a program.**
