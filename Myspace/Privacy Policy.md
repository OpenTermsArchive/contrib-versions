4.  Scope Of This Policy

This Policy describes generally how we collect, use, store and share information that we receive from users of Myspace Services ("**Users**"). This Policy applies both to individuals using such services that register with Myspace and create Myspace Accounts and their associated Profile(s) ("**Members**"), as well as individuals who use such Myspace Services without registering ("**Visitors**").

This Policy covers the activities of Myspace and our affiliates, Viant Technology LLC and Viant UK Ltd. (our "**Affiliates**") with respect to the collection, use, storage and disclosure of information through any of the Myspace Services that contain a link to this Policy. If you follow a link on the Myspace Services to a third party’s website, that third party’s privacy policy will govern its use of your information, and you should read the third party website’s privacy policy. However, when we transfer your Personal Information (defined below in Section 3.1) to third parties, we require the third party to agree to use your Personal Information only in ways that are consistent with this Policy.

Please note that this Policy does not limit Myspace's use or sharing of aggregated, de­identified or other anonymized information that does not constitute Personal Information). We may use and/or share such information in any manner not otherwise prohibited by this Policy or by applicable law, without notice or compensation to you, including freely disclosing for any legal purpose non­Personal Information to VIANT affiliates, advertisers, partners, content owners, and other third parties.

We will continue to evaluate and update this Policy as we rollout additional services for our Users, employ new technologies and otherwise adapt and improve along with the evolving online and digital world so we recommend that you check for changes regularly. We welcome your comments, as we strive to maintain a Policy that is both transparent and that improves the Myspace Services.

To the extent that we provide you notice on any of the Myspace Services of different or additional privacy policies or practices (_e.g._, at the point of our collection), those different or additional terms shall govern such data collection and use.

In addition, please review Myspace Services' Terms of Use, which governs your use of Myspace Services.

11.  The Information That We Collect
    1.  Information You Provide To Us
        
        **Personal Information That You Provide**
        
        We may ask you to provide us with certain information when you interact with the Myspace Services.
        
        Information that identifies you as a particular individual is referred to in this Policy as "**Personal Information**". This would include your full name, e-mail address, telephone number and street address.
        
        We collect Personal Information through the Myspace Services when you choose to provide us with such information, for example, when you register to become a Member. We may also collect Personal Information through a variety of other methods, including when you elect to contact us, submit Profile Content or otherwise interact with the Myspace Services. We may aggregate certain items of your Personal Information (such as your age) to create anonymized statistical information about our User base (which we refer to as "**Aggregated Information**."). Once aggregated, the information in question can no longer be re-attached to you, so it is no longer Personal Information.
        
        *   **Registration Information**
            
            Certain features of the Myspace Services are only accessible by Members who have registered with Myspace and created a Myspace account ("**Account**"). In order to do so, you must first complete a registration form that requests certain basic registration information from you, such as your full name, e-mail address, date of birth, and gender (collectively, "**Registration Information**").
            
        *   **Profile Content**
            
            When you sign up as a Member, you are required to create one or more Myspace profiles that are associated with your Account (each, a "**Profile**"). Myspace may allow you to populate your Profile with certain content chosen by you, and we may also associate additional content with your Profile based on your interactions with the Myspace Services, such as your video viewing and other related activities (collectively, "**Profile Content**"). Any Profile Content that Myspace allows you to submit must comply with the restrictions set forth in our Terms of Use at all times. Please note that your Profile Content may contain Registration Information.
            
            The information in your Profile Content is grouped into two main categories – Restricted Information and Public Information.
            
        
        "**Restricted Information**" refers to those portions of the Profile Content and Activity Notifications associated with your Profile to which you may elect to restrict public access by changing the Profile settings that Myspace may make available to you from time-to­time here ("**Profile Settings**") or by changing other functionality specific settings on the Myspace Services. These Profile Settings may permit you to create a "**Restricted Profile**" by choosing to enable certain (but not absolute) limitations on the availability of certain aspects of your Profile that are not required by Myspace to be Public Information (as described below), certain associated Profile Content, and some of the notifications that Myspace produces regarding your activities ("**Activity Notifications**"). Further, unless otherwise provided by Myspace, all of your Profile Content and Activity Notifications will still be available to the people whose Profiles you allow to connect to you.
        
        **"Public Information"** refers to the portion of your Profile Content that can always be viewed, accessed, and used by anyone with access to the Myspace Services (_e.g._, Myspace, other Users, search engines, advertisers, application developers, other third parties, etc.). Any Profile Content that does not otherwise constitute Restricted Information is considered Public Information for the purposes of this Policy. The following information is Public Information that cannot be changed to Restricted Information:
        
        *   Full Name
        *   Username
        *   Profile URL
        *   About Me (the portion of your Profile that provides a place to describe yourself)
        *   Profile Photo
        *   Profile Cover
        *   Stated Location
        *   Gender
        *   Age
        *   Myspace IDs
        
        **Public Information also includes:**
        
        *   Any additional Profile Content associated with a "**Public Profile**," which refers to any Profile for which a User has set the Profile's visibility status to "Public" in his or her Profile Settings, but subject to Mix privacy settings (as further defined below).
        *   Activity Notifications published on the Myspace Services from Public Profiles;
        *   Your status as a "Top Fan".
        *   Affinity Information (_e.g._, the relative magnitude of your affinity for Profiles and content). and
        *   The number of your connections in and connections out.
        
        Please note that the Myspace Services currently do not allow Users to restrict access to the items of Public Information described above, which can always be viewed, accessed, and used by anyone with access to the Myspace Services, including via third party search engines. If that is not acceptable to you, you should not use the Myspace Services.
        
        You should be aware that the default setting for Profiles of Members who indicate that they are 18 years of age or older is public (_i.e._, Public Profiles). The default setting for Profiles of Members who indicate that they are under 18 years of age is restricted (_i.e._, Restricted Profiles), other than for Artist Profiles (as defined in the Terms of Use) of Members who are under 18 years of age, which are public by default. Other than with respect to Artist Profiles, whose visibility status may not be changed, you may change the visibility status of your Profile from a Public Profile to a Restricted Profile at any time by visiting Profile Settings. Please note, however, that Activity Notifications that were created during the time that your Profile was a Public Profile shall remain public after any change to a Restricted Profile.
        
        Although access to Restricted Information will be limited as set forth above, it is important to note that if you share such information with others, they may copy that information or share it with others, including with the public. Myspace is not responsible for the actions of those with whom you choose to share your Restricted Information. For example, you may choose to use the Myspace Services to access content pages, which are those pages that, for example, represent an individual item of content such as video or audio, or a collection of content such as audio tracks (_e.g._, "Mixes"). When you decide to post content, comments, or other materials to another Member's Profile, a Content Page, or elsewhere on the Myspace Services, that information will be disclosed, and available to third parties consistent with the visibility settings for the relevant Profile or content, **even if those settings are inconsistent with your own Profile Settings**. Content Pages are generally publicly available, which means that posts that you make on those pages will likely be available to anyone. In addition, your video viewing or audio selections may be part of your Profile Content as well as any content pages that you view. Similarly, if you connect to a Public Profile, the fact that you have connected to that Public Profile will be available to anybody with access to the Myspace Services.
        
        The Profile Settings that Myspace makes available to Members, as well as their functionality, may change as the Myspace Services continue to evolve. We will provide reasonable advance notice of the changes in the Profile Settings section, or otherwise. Delays and errors in effecting Profile Setting preferences may occur and we do not represent that they will be immediate, complete, error-free, current, reliable or accurate. If you experience any problems with your Profile Settings, or have any questions or concerns regarding your Profile Settings, or you are interested in obtaining additional information regarding the settings options that may be available to you, please contact us at the Help Site.
        
        The Myspace Services may allow messaging between Members. More information about who can message whom is available here.
        
        More detailed information about Myspace's Profile Settings is available here.
        
        **Account ID And Profile ID**
        
        When you create an Account, Myspace assigns an "**Account ID**" to identify and organize information relating to your Account and a quot;**Profile ID**" for each Profile associated with an Account (collectively, your "**Myspace IDs**"). The Profile ID may allow Myspace to provide a unique internet URL for your Profile ("**Profile URL**"). As described above, Myspace IDs and/or Profile URLs always constitute Public Information and may therefore be viewed, accessed, and/or used by anyone with access to the Myspace Services. You cannot restrict access to Public Information through your Profile Settings, and you cannot make your Myspace IDs and Profile URLs Restricted Information.
        
    2.  Information We Collect Or Store As You Access And Use The Myspace Services
        
        In addition to the information that you choose to submit to us via the Myspace Services, we and our third-party service providers may also collect certain information about you automatically, including through the use of various technologies that passively store or collect certain information whenever you interact with the Myspace Services. This may include information about the nature of a User's interactions with the Myspace Services, such as his or her media consumption activities ("**Usage Information**"). Usage Information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies including cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, entity tags and other similar technologies whether now or later devised (collectively "**Web Technologies**"), some of which may be downloaded to the computer or other Device. The Usage Information that we collect may be non identifying or it may be associated with you, your Account, and your Profile(s). In the event we collect certain information about your interaction with the Myspace Services while you are a Visitor, Myspace may associate that information with your Account if you subsequently become a Member.
        
        Examples of the Usage Information we may collect include:
        
        *   your IP address or unique Device Identifiers;
        *   your Device functionality (_e.g._, browser type, operating system, hardware, mobile network information, _etc_.);
        *   the URL that referred you to the Myspace Services;
        *   the areas within the Myspace Services that you visit and your activities there, including remembering you and your preferences, which artists you are listening to, what videos you are viewing, or Profiles or content pages you choose to connect with, _etc_.;
        *   your Device location (including using GPS and longitude and latitude location information);
        *   your Device characteristics.
        *   certain other Device data (_e.g._, the time of day when the Device is used). and
        *   ranking information about you with respect to other Users or content pages that you interact with (_e.g._, Myspace may record the links to content pages that you post and rank your association with that content compared to other Users).
        
        Please note that certain Web Technologies may set, change, alter, or modify settings or configurations on your Device. Additionally, third parties may use Web Technologies with the Myspace Services. We do not control Web Technologies used by third parties and we are not responsible for them. For more information on the options that may be available to you for opting out of Web Technologies, see Section 5. You can also avoid the Web Technologies used on the Myspace Services by not interacting with the Myspace Services and uninstalling any mobile or other applications for which Myspace is the application publisher.

        Myspace may receive various types of information about you from our Affiliates and from other third parties, including Personal Information (including unique Device Identifiers), web usage information, and inferences drawn from that data.
        
        Myspace may also receive or collect certain information about you from third-party websites, platforms, or services in the event you choose to take advantage of various features that may allow you to integrate information on or to the Myspace Services.

        Myspace will treat any information received from third parties (including providers of Third-Party Linked Services) as set forth in this Policy. However, the information practices of third parties are not governed by this Policy. Myspace cannot control the treatment of your information by third parties and we are not responsible for their privacy practices, which may differ from those described in this Policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policies and terms of service of any such third parties prior to choosing to integrate and/or install them on your Account or disclosing information to them. If you have any questions regarding a third party's information practices, you must contact the relevant entity directly.
        
        If you visit any of our Affiliates’ websites or use services provided by our Affiliates that are not part of the Myspace Services, please be aware that our Affiliates’ privacy policies will apply to their use of your information.
        
    4.  Information You Provide About A Third Party
        
        You may have the opportunity to communicate with others from the Myspace Services, such as by sending an invitation to a friend. If you choose to take advantage of this functionality, we may ask you to provide us with certain information about the person with whom you wish to communicate (_e.g._, name, e-mail address, mobile number, etc.). Before you provide that information to us, you must be sure that your friend has given you permission to do that.

(ix) playing a song or watching a video. (x) adding a song to a mix. (xi) updating a Profile. and (xii) adding a cover photo. An example of an actual Activity Notification on the Myspace Services is the following: "John Doe listened to the song 'True Love Waits'." Activity Notifications may include Profile Content (_e.g._, your full name and Profile photo), and some may aggregate your activity with activity of third parties (_e.g._, "John Doe and Sally Smith connected to a photo.").
    
    **Myspace makes this feature public to everyone by default, and anyone can see these Activity Notifications.** Note that if your Profile is a Restricted Profile, the Profiles that you have allowed to connect to you will still see your Activity Notifications regarding your content consumption on Myspace. From time-to­time we may offer you with options, such as an option to opt out on a session basis (that is, just for a single time when you are using the Myspace Services), or a persistent basis (that is, for every time that you use the Myspace Services), from Activity Notifications related to your content consumption. For more information, please visit here. Session settings are intended to last only as long as your Myspace page is open in your browser. If you close your browser, the session­based setting will be reset to public, and your song and video play Activity Notifications will default to the visibility setting associated with your Profile's visibility. **You should always check the content consumption Activity Notification setting each time you use the Myspace Services, so that you are aware of and comfortable with your media consumption appearing as Activity Notifications.**
    
    We may use Usage Information (such as about your media consumption, connections to content pages or Profiles, and posts regarding content pages or Profiles), and your Profile Content, to rank affinity to other Profiles and content. This allows us to identify "**Top Fans**", and we may use your Public Information to display that you are a Top Fan of an artist, other Profile, or a piece of content. Top Fan status is Public Information – anyone may see your status as a Top Fan. We also may provide analytics tools to Artist Profiles that allow the owners of such Artist Profiles to see Public Information of Users who strongly engage with the Artist Profile or the content pages controlled by the Artist Profile (e.g., videos or songs or such Artist Profile), including Users that are not connected to the Artist Profile.
    
    **Unless otherwise noted, your consumption of media on the Myspace Services will be Public Information.**

    19.  To Deliver Social Advertising To You And Your Friends
    
    Many of the Myspace Services are free to Users because they are supported by advertising. We strive to make the advertising on the Myspace Services as relevant to you as possible. As a result, you may be served ads that are personalized based on, for example, your location, age, gender, content consumption, connections and other information, and we and third parties may use Web Technologies to deliver these ads. Additionally, we may share your Personal Information, Usage Information, Device Identifiers, and any other information that we receive or collect with third parties (including our Affiliates and our third­party advertising partners) in order to enable customization of the advertising displayed on the Myspace Services, other websites across the internet and other platforms, services and networks, including mobile and other connected Device platforms, and for other purposes not prohibited by this Policy. The parties with whom we may share your information may supplement your information with information they receive about you from others, in order to customize the advertisements they serve. They may also, in turn, share your information with others.
    
    If you do not wish for Myspace to use or share your information for purposes of personalized advertising, please click here to adjust your Myspace privacy settings.
    
    For additional information regarding the privacy practices of our third­party advertising partners, as well as the choices that they may make available to you, please click here.
    
    23.  How we protect your privacy when targeting ads to you
    
    When we or our affiliates use your personal data to deliver targeted advertising to you, we use ad delivery technologies that encrypt information that would otherwise identify you to prevent the third party advertiser from knowing who you are. The encryption technologies that we use convert data that identifies you (like a registered account name or e-mail address) into a string of characters that cannot be turned back into information that identifies you. So the third party that displays the ad to you will know that the ad is being displayed to someone with certain characteristics (_e.g._, a woman in her early twenties who likes to listen to Rihanna and go to music events) but the third party won’t have your name, e-mail address or any other information that would allow them to identify you specifically. We add information about the ads that have been shown to you and information about devices, purchasing or online behavior associated with a particular encryption-generated identifier to create a profile for that identifier. This profile helps us to better match ads to your interests and avoid showing you the same ads too many times. If you have a Myspace account, we store that profile until you delete your Myspace account or change your personalized advertising settings to turn off personalized advertising.
    
    25.  To Protect The Rights Of Myspace And Our Users, And To Comply With Legal Process
    
    To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Myspace may also disclose User information if we believe in good faith that doing so is necessary or appropriate to: (i) protect or defend the rights, safety or property of Myspace or third parties (including through the enforcement of this Policy, our Terms of Use, and other applicable agreements and policies). or (ii) comply with legal and regulatory obligations (_e.g._, pursuant to law enforcement inquiries, subpoenas, court orders or consent decrees). To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Myspace has complete discretion in electing to make or not make such disclosures, and to contest or not contest requests for such disclosures, all without notice to you. More information is available in our Law Enforcement Guidelines.
    
    27.  Business Transfers
    
    Myspace may disclose User information in the event we file for bankruptcy, or in connection with certain types of business transactions that result in corporate change. For example, if Myspace is or may be (or substantially all of its assets are or may be) acquired by a third party pursuant to an acquisition, merger, sale, reorganization, liquidation, or similar business transfer, we may disclose and transfer User information to the parties involved in the transaction (_e.g._, in connection with due diligence efforts or as a transferred asset).
    
    29.  Co-Branded Areas
    
    Certain areas of the Myspace Services may be provided to you in association with third parties ("**Co-Branded Areas**") such as sponsors, charities and political organizations and will generally require you to disclose Personal Information to them. Such Co-Branded Areas will identify the third party and indicate if they have a privacy policy that applies to their collection and use of you information. If you elect to register for products and/or services, communicate with such third parties or download their content or applications, at Co-Branded Areas, you may be providing your information to both us and the third party. Further, if you sign-in to a Co-Branded Area with a username and password obtained on the Myspace Services, your Personal Information may be disclosed to the identified third parties for that Co-Branded Area. We are not responsible for such third party's data collection or practices and you should look to such third-party privacy policies for more information.
    
    31.  Sweepstakes, Contests And Promotions
    
    We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (collectively, "**Promotions**") through the Myspace Services that may require registration. By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, allowing the sponsor of the Promotion to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing associated with the Promotion. If you choose to enter a Promotion, Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion, including, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by the Promotion's official rules, such as on a winners list.
