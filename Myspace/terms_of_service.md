Introduction
------------

Myspace LLC ("**Myspace**", "**we**", "**our**" or "**us**") operates Myspace®, a place where people come to connect, discover, and share. Showcasing artists and their work, Myspace gives people access to a massive digital music library. With roots in music and social, the platform is built to empower all artists—from musicians and designers to writers and photographers—helping them connect with audiences, collaborators, and partners to achieve their goals. Through an open design, compelling editorial features, and analytics-based recommendations, Myspace fosters a creative community of people who connect around mutual affinity and inspiration for the purpose of shaping, sharing, and discovering what’s next.

The services offered by Myspace include (i) those offered on any Myspace-branded URL, including [www.myspace.com](http://www.myspace.com) (the "**Myspace Website**"), (ii) Myspace music and video services, (iii) Myspace developer services, (iv) Myspace mobile services, (v) Myspace advertising services, and (vi) any other features, content, or applications offered or operated from time to time by Myspace in connection with Myspace’s business, including when Myspace is accessed via the internet, mobile device, television or other device (collectively, "**Myspace Services**"). The Myspace Services are hosted in the United States, and if you reside outside of the United States by using the Services you consent to the transfer of your personal data to the United States and elsewhere for all purposes identified in our Privacy Notice and/or Policy. **If you do not agree to this international transfer of data, then you must refrain from using the Myspace Services.** For more information, please see our [Privacy Notice](/pages/eeaprivacy) and [Privacy Policy](/pages/privacy).

This Agreement constitutes legally binding terms and applies to such use of the Myspace Services regardless of the type of device used to access them (“**Device**”) unless such services post a different terms of use or end user license agreement, in which case that agreement (“**Other Terms**”) shall instead govern. By accessing and/or using any of the Myspace Services, you agree to be bound by this Agreement (or if applicable, the Other Terms), whether you are a “Visitor” (which means that you simply browse the Myspace Services, including, without limitation, through a mobile or other wireless Device, or otherwise use the Myspace Services without being registered) or you are a “**Member**” (which means that you have registered with Myspace). The term “**User**” refers to a Visitor or a Member. You are authorized to use the Myspace Services (regardless of whether your access or use is intended) only if you agree to abide by all applicable laws, rules and regulations (“**Applicable Law**”) and the terms of this Agreement. In addition, in consideration for becoming a Member and/or making use of the Myspace Services, you must indicate your acceptance of this Agreement during the registration process. Thereafter, you may create your account (your “**Account**”), and its associated profile(s) (each a “**Profile**”) in accordance with the terms herein.

In some instances, both this Agreement and separate guidelines, rules, or terms of service or sale setting forth additional or different terms and/or conditions will apply to your use of the Myspace Services or to a service or product offered via the Myspace Services (in each such instance, and collectively, “**Additional Terms**”). To the extent there is a conflict between this Agreement and any Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control unless the Additional Terms expressly state otherwise.

If you do not agree to any change(s) after receiving a notice of such change(s), you shall stop using the Myspace Services. Otherwise, your continued use of Myspace Services constitutes your acceptance of such change(s). The Myspace Services currently only support the MP4 media file format. We are not responsible for the ongoing integrity, accessibility, or usability of any uploaded files so please back up any data you upload to the Myspace Website.
    
    You may terminate your Membership at any time, for any reason, by following the instructions in your Profile Settings (discussed further in [Section 9](#9)). Myspace may terminate the Myspace Services and/or your Membership at any time, for any or no reason, with or without prior notice or explanation, and without liability, except that you may have certain refund rights as provided in the next section.

    In addition, Myspace reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reassign or rename your username and/or Profile URL and to allow indexing of such URL by third party search engines. Myspace expressly reserves the right to remove your Profile or Content, in whole or in part, and/or deny, restrict, suspend, or terminate your access to all or any part of the Myspace Services, if Myspace determines, in its sole discretion, that you have violated this Agreement, are acting in a manner we deem inappropriate for the Myspace Services, or pose a threat to Myspace, its employees, business partners, Users and/or the public. Even after Membership is terminated, or you cease using the Myspace Services, some terms of your Agreement with Myspace will remain in effect, including, without limitation, Sections 5-23, except as may be mutually agreed (e.g., acceptance of Other Terms).

14.  Use by Members
    
    The Myspace Services are for the personal use of Members and Users and may only be used for direct commercial purposes if they are specifically endorsed or authorized by Myspace. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Myspace permits artists (e.g., musicians, actors, comedians, etc.) to create Profiles and post Content that promote the artist’s or artists’ professional endeavors or commercial activities (to the extent that they are not competitive with the Myspace Services) and any such use of the Myspace Services for such purposes is not considered a commercial use of the Myspace services in violation of this Agreement. Myspace reserves the right to remove commercial content in its sole discretion. Without limiting the generality of the commercial use restrictions, the unauthorized collection of usernames, user id numbers or similar designation, and/or email addresses of Members by electronic or other means, or employing third party promotional sites or software to promote Profiles for money, is prohibited. Commercial advertisements, endorsements, affiliate links, and other forms of unauthorized data collection or solicitation may be removed from Profiles without notice or explanation and may result in termination of Membership privileges.
    
    To maintain the Myspace Services in a manner we deem appropriate for our venue and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Myspace may, but will not have any obligation to, review, monitor, display, reject, refuse to post, store, maintain, accept or remove any Content (as further defined below) posted (including, without limitation, private Myspace messages, public comments, public group chat messages, private group chat messages or private instant messages (collectively, “Messages”)) by you, and Myspace may, in its sole discretion, delete, move, re-format, remove or refuse to post or otherwise make use of Content without notice or any liability to you or any third party in connection with our operation of Content venues in an appropriate manner. Without limitation, we may do so to address Content that comes to our attention that we believe is offensive, obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, violent, harassing, threatening, abusive, illegal or otherwise objectionable or inappropriate, or to enforce the rights of third parties or the Agreement or any applicable Additional Terms, including, without limitation, the Content restrictions set forth below in [Section 8](#8).
    

17.  Proprietary Rights in Content on Myspace
    1.  Myspace does not claim any ownership rights in the text, Messages, files, images, photos, video, sounds, musical works, sound recordings, works of authorship, applications, or any other materials (collectively, “Content”) that you transmit, submit, display or publish (“post”) on, through or in connection with the Myspace Services. After posting your Content on, through or in connection with the Myspace Services, you continue to retain any such rights that you may have in your Content, subject to the limited license granted herein. By posting any Content on, through or in connection with the Myspace Services, you hereby grant to Myspace a limited license to use, modify, delete from, add to, combine with other content, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, transmit, sell, distribute, and otherwise exploit such Content by all means and manners now or later known, including, without limitation, on, through or in connection with the Myspace Services to third party applications; widgets; websites; or mobile, desktop or other services which are linked with your Account at your election (collectively, “**Linked Services**”), including, without limitation, distributing part or all of the Myspace Services and any Content included therein, in any media formats and through any media channels. Content submitted by Users and authorized by the User to be distributed on Linked Services need not be maintained on the Myspace Services by us for any period of time, and Users will not have the right, once submitted, to access, archive, maintain or otherwise use such Content on the Myspace Services or elsewhere. The license you grant is perpetual; provided, however, that after you remove your Content from the Myspace Services, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to remove such specific deleted Content from further distribution on the Myspace Services, as soon as practicable but, please be aware that any distribution of your Content that may have occurred by you or other Users via Linked Services, or otherwise (e.g., posted on third party User’s Profiles, sent by you to other Users, contributed to a mashup of Content from multiple Users, etc.) may continue to be displayed, distributed and used. Further, deleted Content may persist in archival copies on Myspace servers for a reasonable period of time. You understand and agree that once Content is distributed to a Linked Service, or incorporated into other aspects of the Myspace Services (e.g., as part of a derivative work), Myspace is under no obligation to delete or ask other Users or a Linked Service to delete that Content; therefore, it may continue to appear and be used indefinitely.
        
    2.  The license you grant to Myspace is non-exclusive (meaning you are free to license your Content to anyone else in addition to Myspace), fully-paid and royalty-free (meaning that Myspace is not required to pay you or anyone else deriving rights from you for the use by Myspace of the Content that you post), sublicensable (so that Myspace is able to use its affiliates, subcontractors and other partners such as Internet content delivery networks and wireless carriers to provide the Myspace Services and, subject to good faith efforts to honor your [Profile Settings](/settings/profile), to third party search engines), and worldwide (because the Internet and the Myspace Services are global in reach). You also hereby grant to Myspace, and agree to grant to Myspace, the unconditional, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable, fully-paid and royalty free right to use, share and exploit your name, persona, and likeness, and your Profile information and information about your activities on the Myspace Services (including, without limitation, your activities in connection with our sponsors and advertisers), without any obligation or remuneration to you. However, from time to time we may offer you choices regarding how information about you is shared and we will make good faith efforts to honor your elections. For more information, see Profile Settings. Except as prohibited by law, you hereby waive, and you agree to waive, any moral rights (including attribution and integrity) that you may have in any Content. To the extent not waivable, you irrevocably agree not to exercise such rights (if any) in a manner that interferes with any exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You understand that you will not receive any fees, sums, consideration, or remuneration for any of the rights granted in this Section 6. If you are a minor, you represent and warrant that your parent or legal guardian has consented to you granting the rights as set forth in this Section 6, or that are provided in any Additional Terms.
        
    3.  Each time you submit any Content, you represent and warrant that you are at least the age of majority in the jurisdiction in which you reside or are the parent or legal guardian, or have all proper consents from the parent or legal guardian, of any minor (including yourself) who is depicted in or contributed to any Content you submit, and that, as to that Content: (i) you are the sole author and/or owner of the Content posted by you on, through or in connection with the Myspace Services, or otherwise have the lawful right to grant the license set forth in this Section 6 or that is provided in any Additional Terms, all without any Myspace obligation to obtain consent of any third party and without creating any obligation or liability of Myspace, (ii) the Content is accurate (other than as authorized in [Section 8](#8) or any Additional Terms); (iii) the posting of your Content on, through or in connection with the Myspace Services and/or Linked Services does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, intellectual property rights, contract rights or any other rights of any person or entity; and (iv) the Content will not violate this Agreement (including the prohibitions in [Section 8](#8) or any Additional Terms, or cause injury or harm to any person. You agree to pay all royalties, fees, and any other monies owing any person or entity by reason of the use of any Content posted by you on or through the Myspace Services and/or Linked Services.
        
    4.  Except as otherwise described in the applicable Myspace Services’ posted [Privacy Policy](/pages/privacy), or any Additional Terms, you agree that (a) your Content will be treated as non-confidential - regardless of whether you mark them “confidential,” “proprietary,” or the like - and will not be returned, and (b) Myspace does not assume any obligation of any kind to you or any third party with respect to your Content. Certain content related to classic Myspace accounts (messages, comments, blogs, games, posts, and customizable background art) is no longer available for retrieval or download. Audio files that were uploaded over three years ago and flash video files are also no longer available for retrieval or download. Upon Myspace’s request, you will furnish us with any documentation necessary to substantiate the rights to such Content and to verify your compliance with this Agreement and any applicable Additional Terms. You acknowledge that the internet, and the technology of Myspace and third parties used to enable it, may be subject to breaches of security and that you are aware that submissions of Content may not be secure, and you will consider this before submitting any Content.
        
    5.  In your communications with Myspace, please keep in mind that we do not seek any unsolicited ideas or materials for products or services, or even Myspace improvements to products or services, such as ideas, concepts, inventions, or designs for musical productions or equipment, books, scripts, screenplays, motion pictures, television shows, theatrical productions, or webisodes (collectively, “Unsolicited Ideas and Materials”). Any Unsolicited Ideas and Materials you post on or send to us (via the Myspace Services or otherwise) are deemed User Content and licensed to us as set forth in this Section 6. In addition, Myspace retains all of the rights held by members of the general public with regard to your Unsolicited Ideas and Materials. Myspace’s receipt of your Unsolicited Ideas and Materials is not an admission by Myspace of their novelty, priority, or originality, and it does not impair Myspace’s right to contest existing or future intellectual property rights relating to your Unsolicited Ideas and Materials.
        
    7.  The Myspace Services contain Content owned by Myspace (“**Myspace Content**”). Myspace Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and Myspace owns and retains all rights in the Myspace Content and the Myspace Services. Myspace hereby grants you a limited, revocable, nonsublicensable license to reproduce and display the Myspace Content (excluding any software code) solely for your personal use (and for the promotional uses permitted to artists hereunder) in connection with viewing the Myspace Website and using the Myspace Services, and in connection with standard search engine activity or use of a standard Internet browser (e.g., for making cache copies). From time to time, Myspace may make available to Users certain explicitly designated Myspace Content for Users use as part of User Content (defined below) (“**Myspace Licensed Elements**”), but only for such purposes as may be explicitly stated at the time that the Myspace Licensed Elements are made available on the Myspace Services; but we and our licensors and certain other third parties, as the case may be, retain ownership of such Myspace Licensed Elements. The foregoing limited license: (i) does not give you any ownership of, or any other intellectual property interest in, any Myspace Content, and (ii) may be immediately suspended or terminated for any reason, in Myspace’s sole discretion, and without advance notice or liability. In some instances, we may permit you to have greater access to and use of Myspace Content and/or Myspace Licensed Elements, subject to certain Additional Terms. You are only granted a limited license, and, as between you and Myspace, there is not a sale with respect to Myspace Content.
        
    8.  The Myspace Services contain Content of Users (“**User Content**”). Except as otherwise provided within this Agreement, or in any Additional Terms, you may not copy, download, communicate, make available, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, display, sell or otherwise use any User Content appearing on or through the Myspace Services.
        
    9.  The Myspace Services contain Content of third party licensors that are not Users (such licensors, “**Third Party Licensors**” and such content “**Third Party Content**”).

20.  Content Posted
    
    Please choose carefully the information that you post on, through or in connection with the Myspace Services and that you provide to other Users. Your Profile may not include any form of Prohibited Content, as outlined in [Section 8](#8) below. Despite this prohibition, information, materials, products or services provided by other Myspace Members (for instance, in their Profiles) or Linked Services may, in whole or in part, be unauthorized, impermissible or otherwise violate this Agreement, and Myspace assumes no responsibility or liability for this material. If you become aware of misuse of the Myspace Services by any person or Linked Service, please visit our [Help Site](/help) or, if available, click on the Profile, image, video, comment or other item to report the Content directly to our support team.
    
    1.  Myspace may reject, refuse to post or delete any Content that, in the sole judgment of Myspace, violates this Agreement, is inappropriate for the Myspace Services or which may be offensive, illegal or violates the rights of any person or entity, or harms or threatens the safety of any person or entity. However, we are not obligated to take any action not required by law. Myspace, may, but assumes no responsibility or obligation for reviewing or monitoring the Myspace Services for inappropriate Content or conduct. If at any time Myspace chooses, in its sole discretion, to review or monitor the Myspace Services, Myspace nonetheless assumes no responsibility for the Content, no obligation to modify or remove any inappropriate Content, and no responsibility for the conduct of the User submitting any such Content.
        
    2.  You are solely responsible for the Content that you post on, through or in connection with any of the Myspace Services and/or Linked Services, and any material or information that you transmit to other Members and for your interactions with other Users. Any breach by you of this [Section 7](#7) will be subject to the indemnification obligations set forth in [Section 19](#19) below. We reserve the right to request at any time proof of the permissions referred to above in a form acceptable to us. Failure to provide such proof may lead to, among other things, the Content in question being removed from the Myspace Services.
        
    4.  The Myspace Services are a community and inherently a social media experience. Subject to our good faith efforts to honor your election of certain options we may offer from time to time that may offer you certain choices regarding what is shared and with whom, your activities, Content and Content consumption (including videos and music) may be viewable by, or shared with, others on and off of the Myspace Services, including advertisers. You consent to this, and irrevocably grant us the sublicensable right to use and exploit your name, persona, likeness, pseudonym, Profile picture, information and Content, and to share it with others, without any obligation or remuneration to you. This may include, without limitation, associating you with commercial, sponsored or related content (such as a brand you like or the sponsors of an ad you click on). As examples, if you listen to a song by an artist, or become their fan, other Users may be told that and we may serve you ads for other artists or Content you might like. If you are not the age of majority where you reside, you represent and warrant that your parent or guardian has read this section and consented and agreed on your behalf.
        
        For more information on social ads, social media consumption activity notifications and other activity notifications, and your options regarding them, and on how to opt-out of certain third-party ad serving, see our [Privacy Policy](/pages/privacy) and [Video Privacy Policy](/pages/videoprivacy).

If you breach this Agreement and send or cause to send (directly or indirectly) unsolicited bulk Messages or other unauthorized commercial communications of any kind through the Myspace Services, you acknowledge that you will have caused substantial harm to Myspace, but that the amount of such harm would be extremely difficult to ascertain. _**To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, as a reasonable estimation of such harm, you agree to pay Myspace Fifty Dollars ($50) for each actual or intended recipient of such unsolicited Message or other unauthorized commercial communication you send through the Myspace Services;**_

24.  Profiles and Profile Settings
    
    Myspace may allow you to create multiple Profiles associated with your Account on certain aspects of, or all of the Myspace Services. Examples of such Profiles are “Real Name Profiles”, “Alias Profiles”, “Parody Profiles”, “Role Playing Profiles”, “Fan Profiles”, “Artist Profiles”, or other Profiles that Myspace may authorize from time to time. We may offer you, from time to time, the ability to choose how you share or make your Profile, or aspects of it, available to others by means of “**Profile Settings**”, which functionality may change as the Myspace Services evolve. Myspace currently makes all Profiles of Members aged 18 and older public by default. Profiles of Members whose ages are 13 to 17 are currently “restricted” by default, as further detailed in the [Privacy Policy](/pages/privacy). You may adjust the public or restricted status of your Profile in your Profile Settings. We will make good faith efforts to honor Profile Settings, but are not responsible for errors and reserve the right to change the way Settings and preferences work from time to time, so visit your Profile Settings regularly to ensure that the reflect your preferences and to see how we may have added or changed how you can exercise choice. For more information on how to use Profile Settings, and how they are intended to work, click [here](/settings/profile). You may not use any Profile for purpose of impersonation, deception or confusion.
    
    1.  **Real Name Profiles**. You may create a Profile in which your activities on the Myspace Services are associated with your real name (each, a “**Real Name Profile**”), and you agree and acknowledge that any risk associated with such Real Name Profiles are borne solely by you.
    2.  **Alias Profiles**. An Alias Profile allows you to create an alternate public-facing profile as an alternative to a Real Name Profile, which publicly displays your real name in association with your Profile and activities on the Myspace Services. For example, you might decide that in an Alias Profile, your username or full name for that Profile is a nickname or other made up name.
    3.  **Parody, Role Playing and Fan Profiles**. Myspace may allow you to create profiles for the purpose of parody, role playing, or being a fan (collectively, Parody, Role Playing and Fan Profiles are known as “**Non-Standard Profiles**”). You are allowed to create Non-Standard Profiles, but you must indicate in the Non-Standard Profile that Non-Standard Profile will be used for the Non-Standard Profile purposes, by including a statement of this fact in the about section of your Profile (e.g., “This is a parody Profile.”, or similar language). You must also ensure that the full name that you choose for the Non-Standard Profile includes some indication that the Non-Standard Profile is being used in a parody, role-playing, fan or other manner than as a true and veritable Account of an actual living person. For example, if you want to create a Non-Standard Profile for the purpose of (i) role playing, you should add “-roleplay” to the end of the desired full name; (ii) fanning, you should add “-fan” to the end of the desired full name; (iii) parody or farce, you should add “-fake”, “-parody”, or “-joke” to the end of the desired full name. You must not use a Non-Standard Profile for purposes of impersonation, deception or confusion.
    4.  **Artist Profiles**. Myspace may allow you to create a Profile specifically designed for artists (each an “**Artist Profile**”), for example, musicians, comedians, or other artists. Myspace may provide Artist Profiles with features and functionality not available to other Profile types, and you must not use an Artist Profile if you are not legitimately an artist.
    5.  **Suspension or Termination**. Myspace may suspend or terminate Profiles, and/or the Membership of Accounts associated with them, in the event they do not comply with this Agreement, or for any other or no reason. Individuals and artists that are Members may set up profiles, subject to certain rules. From time to time we may offer certain functionality to allow you to express privacy, communication and other preferences, which we will make a good faith effort to honor.

27.  Protecting Copyrights and Other Intellectual Property
    
    Myspace respects the intellectual property of others, and requires that our Users and Members do the same. You may not upload, embed, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available any Content that infringes any copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, privacy, publicity or other proprietary rights of any person or entity. It is Myspace’s policy to terminate, in appropriate circumstances, the Membership of repeat or substantial infringers. If you believe your work has been copied and posted on or through the Myspace Services in a way that constitutes copyright and/or trademark infringement, please see the [Copyright Infringement Notice Form](/legal/claims/notice) and the [Trademark Infringement Notice Form](/legal/claims/notice?isTrademark=true) where you may notify Myspace of your complaint. More information about copyright and trademark can be found [here](//help.myspace.com/hc/en-us/articles/201992384-Copyright-Trademark).
    

30.  Linking
    1.  **Linked Services.**
        1.  Linked Services created by third party developers may be available on, through or in connection with the Myspace Services. Linked Services include applications, websites, desktop, wireless, mobile and other services available from third parties which can be installed onto your Profile, or elsewhere on the Myspace Services, shared with other Users on the Myspace Services, otherwise accessed via the Myspace Services, or which may link to your Profile from outside of the Myspace Services. Linked Services may use your Profile information, friends and/or other Profile Content on the Linked Service and share activity events between Myspace and the Linked Service (depending on the features the Linked Service chooses to make available). We may offer you certain ability to control what is initially shared with Linked Services through your Profile Settings, or permission options otherwise made available to you (e.g., when downloading, accessing or activating Linked Services), and we will use good faith efforts to honor those choices.
            
        2.  Third parties that offer Linked Services may also provide you with certain options and choices, but keep in mind that when you engage with a Linked Service, you are interacting with a third party, not with Myspace. Myspace does not control the third party, and cannot dictate its actions. If you choose to use a Linked Service, the Linked Service may collect, store, use and share your data in accordance with the terms of service and privacy policy of and your privacy settings (if any) on such Linked Service (not Myspace’s privacy settings or privacy policy). In addition, the third party providing the Linked Service may use other parties to provide portions of the application or service to you, such as technology, development or payment services. Myspace may have limited control or no control at all over the content, operations, policies, terms, or other elements of Linked Service, and Myspace does not assume any obligation to review any Linked Service. Myspace does not endorse, approve, or sponsor any Linked Service, or any third-party content, advertising, information, materials, products, services, or other items. Myspace is not responsible for the quality or delivery of the products or services offered, accessed, obtained by or advertised at such Linked Services and makes no warranties, express or implied, as to the Linked Services or the providers of such Linked Services (including, but not limited to, the privacy practices thereof). Myspace encourages you not to provide any personally identifiable information to any Linked Service unless you know and are comfortable with the third party with whom you are interacting. Finally, Myspace will under no circumstances be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental or special loss or other damages, whether arising from negligence, breach of contract, defamation, infringement of copyright or other intellectual property rights, caused by the exhibition, distribution or exploitation of any information or content contained within Linked Services. Any activities you engage in with any of the same, including but not limited to the provision of Content or data to them, are subject to the privacy and other policies, terms and conditions of use, and rules issued by the operator of the Linked Service so we encourage you to review them carefully.
            
    2.  Hyperlinks to Myspace. We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-assignable, personal, and non-transferable license to create hyperlinks to the Myspace Services, so long as: (a) the links only incorporate text, and do not use any trademarked logos or graphics that are owned by or licensed to Myspace, without Myspace’s prior authorization, (b) the links and the content on your website do not suggest any affiliation with Myspace or cause any other confusion, and (c) the links and the content on your website do not portray Myspace or its products or services in a false, misleading, derogatory, or otherwise offensive matter, and do not contain content that is unlawful, offensive, obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, violent, threatening, harassing, or abusive, or that violate any right of any third party or are otherwise objectionable to Myspace. Myspace reserves the right to suspend or prohibit linking to the Myspace Services for any reason, in its sole discretion, without advance notice or any liability of any kind to you or any third party.
        
    3.  Ads, Affiliate Programs, and Links. Myspace may participate in various advertising and/or affiliate marketing programs. These programs are designed to provide a means for companies like Myspace to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to other websites that sell products or services. Myspace may generate revenue from these other websites when you either click these links or purchase products and/or services from these links on those other websites.
        

33.  Member Disputes
    
    You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Users, third party developers and any other parties with whom you interact through the Myspace Services and/or Linked Services so use caution when dealing with others. Myspace reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with these disputes.

Effective May 25, 2018, we will not serve interest based advertising to EEA residents in connection with the Myspace Services.

48.  Arbitration and No Class Relief
    
    Certain portions of this Section 17 are deemed to be a “written agreement to arbitrate” pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act and apply to all Users of the Myspace Services where the mandatory laws in their country of residence permit such arbitration. You and Myspace agree that we intend that this Section 17 satisfies the “writing” requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act. Where arbitration is not permitted by the mandatory laws in your country of residence, the provisions of Section 17 shall apply to all relevant disputes between you and Myspace. This Section 17 can only be changed or terminated upon mutual agreement.
    
    1.  **Disputes**. Any controversy, allegation, or claim between you and Myspace arising out of or relating to the Myspace Services, the Myspace Content, the Content, this Agreement, or any Additional Terms, whether heretofore or hereafter arising are “Disputes”. References to "Myspace” include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all beneficiaries of the Myspace Services.
        
        1.  **First - Try to Resolve**. If you or Myspace becomes aware of a Dispute, then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it. Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us. But if no such information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no obligation under this Section 17.1.1. Your notice to us must be sent to: Myspace LLC, 8391 Beverly Blvd., #349, Los Angeles, CA 90048, Attn: Business & Legal Affairs. For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, Myspace and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Dispute, though nothing will require either you or Myspace to resolve the Dispute on terms with respect to which you and Myspace, in each of our sole discretion, are not comfortable.
            
        3.  **Arbitration of Most Disputes**. If we cannot resolve a Dispute as set forth in Section 17.1.1 within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice, then either you or we may submit the Dispute to formal arbitration in accordance with this Section 17.1, unless it is an Excluded Dispute, which shall be handled in accordance with Section 17.2.
            
        4.  **Arbitrator**. Upon expiration of the applicable sixty (60)-day period and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, a Dispute will be resolved solely by binding arbitration in accordance with the then-current JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures of JAMS, Inc. (“**JAMS**”). JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information are available, as follows:
            
            **JAMS: 949.224.1810**
            
            [http://www.jamsadr.com](http://www.jamsadr.com)
            
        5.  **Nature, Limitations, and Location of Alternative Dispute Resolution**. In arbitration, as with a court, the arbitrator must honor the terms of this Agreement (and any Additional Terms) and can award the prevailing party damages and other relief (including attorneys’ fees). However, WITH ARBITRATION: (A) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, (B) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (C) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED. All parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing. If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in the “metropolitan statistical area” (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) where you are a resident at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration. You and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator’s fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules; but, if applicable arbitration rules or laws require Myspace to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section 17 to be enforceable, then Myspace will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration. Discovery will be permitted pursuant to the applicable arbitration rules. The arbitrator’s decision must consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the Dispute, and must provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and any award (if any) is based. Judgment on the arbitration decision and award (if any) may be entered in or by any court that has jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to Section 9 of the Federal Arbitration Act.
            
        6.  **No Class Action Matters**. Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be consolidated with any other arbitrations or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party, with the exception of representative claims solely for injunctive relief brought under California unfair competition law. If any provision of this arbitration provision is deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision shall be severable from the remainder of this paragraph, which shall remain fully enforceable. AGREEMENT TO THESE TERMS CONSTITUTES AN AGREEMENT TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM FOR ALLEGED DAMAGES ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND A WAIVER OF THE ABILITY TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM IN A CLASS ACTION.
            
        7.  **Limited Time to File Claims**. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR WE WANT TO ASSERT A DISPUTE (BUT NOT A EXCLUDED DISPUTE) AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR WE MUST COMMENCE IT (BY DELIVERY OF WRITTEN NOTICE AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 17.1.1 WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER DISCOVERY OF THE DISPUTE ARISES -- OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.
            
    2.  Excluded Disputes. The following disputes constitute “Excluded Disputes” hereunder: (i) any Dispute regarding any of Myspace’s actual or alleged intellectual property rights, (ii) Disputes, to the extent that the laws of the State of California authorize may be brought in small claims court, and (iii) legal action taken by Myspace to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with, any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) relating to the Myspace Services, any Content, your User Content and/or Myspace’s intellectual property rights (including such Myspace may claim that may be in dispute), Myspace’s operations, and/or Myspace’s products or services (collectively, “Injunctive Relief”).
        
        1.  **First - Try to Resolve**. If (x) any Excluded Dispute arises, and (y) excluding Excluded Disputes involving Injunctive Relief, you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Excluded Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it. Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us. But if no such information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no obligation under this Section 17.2.1. Your notice to us must be sent to: Myspace LLC, 8391 Beverly Blvd., #349, Los Angeles, CA 90048, Attn: Business & Legal Affairs. For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, Myspace and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Excluded Dispute, though nothing will require either you or Myspace to resolve the Excluded Dispute on terms with respect to which you and Myspace, in each of our sole discretion, are not comfortable.
            
        2.  If we cannot resolve authorized Excluded Dispute as set forth in Section 17.2.1 within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice, then either you or we may submit the Excluded Dispute to formal arbitration pursuant to Section 17.1 only if you and Myspace consent, in a writing signed by you and an officer or business and legal affairs representative of Myspace, to have that Excluded Dispute subject to arbitration. In such a case (and only in such a case), that Excluded Dispute will be deemed a “Dispute” and shall be governed by Section 17.1. In the absence of such agreement, Section 17.1 shall not apply to Excluded Disputes, and Sections 17.3 and 17.4 shall apply.
            
        3.  **Injunctive Relief**. With respect to Excluded Disputes involving Injunctive Relief, Section 17.3 and 17.4 apply, and Myspace may institute such Excluded Disputes as authorized therein immediately.
            
    4.  **Jurisdiction**. Except to the extent that arbitration is required in Section 17.1 or authorized in Section 17.2, and except as to the enforcement of any arbitration decision or award, any action or proceeding relating to any Dispute or Excluded Dispute may only be instituted in state or federal court in Los Angeles County, California. Accordingly, you and Myspace consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts for such matters.
        
    6.  **Governing Law**. This Agreement and any Additional Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with, and any Dispute and Excluded Dispute will be resolved in accordance with, the laws of the California, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions.
