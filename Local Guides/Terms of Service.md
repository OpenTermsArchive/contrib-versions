Local Guides Terms and Conditions
=================================

Local Guides are contributors who share ratings, reviews, photos, edits and other factual updates to places on Google Maps. As a Local Guide, you agree to be bound by the following: (1) the Google Terms of Service (the 'Universal Terms'); and; (2) the additional terms and conditions set forth below (the 'Additional Terms'). You should read each of these two documents, as together they form a binding agreement between you and Google LLC regarding your participation as a Local Guide in the Local Guides programme (the 'Programme') and your use of Google’s products and services. Collectively, the Universal Terms, the Code of Conduct and the Additional Terms are referred to as the 'Terms'.

Who is qualified to be a Local Guide?
-------------------------------------

Maps users who have a valid Google account and meet the [age requirements for their country](https://maps.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409) are considered to be a Local Guide and receive points and levels.

Google Workspace for Education accounts that are under 18 years of age, organisations, brands, businesses and accounts that are banned for policy violations may not receive Local Guide points and levels. You’re not allowed to bundle services for hire with your Local Guide membership.

Local Guides contributions and levels
-------------------------------------

As a Local Guide, you will be placed into a level based on how much local content you contribute on Google, including how many high-quality contributions you've shared on Google since creating your Google account. Level requirements and descriptions are subject to change, at Google’s sole discretion.

Contributions are considered 'High Quality' when they adhere to the guidelines described [in our Help Centre](https://maps.google.com/local-guides/answer/7358351) or as otherwise provided by Google. When you reach Level 4, Google highlights your Local Guides status with a Local Guide badge or icon on your profile or contributions. From time to time, Google may elect, at its sole discretion, to feature you and your content in other channels related to Google and its affiliates or partners.

Some Local Guides may receive invitations to attend special events held by Google ('Events'). At some Events, you may be permitted to bring a guest (as indicated by Google). Event invitations are limited to only Local Guides and (if applicable) their guest(s) who meet the legal drinking age in the Event city. You must share these terms with your guest prior to bringing your guest to an Event.

Events, perks and early access rules are subject to change at any time and without advance notice.

#### Limited or no perks

Some participants may be ineligible for some or all perks, including persons who are:

*   Residents of US embargoed countries;
*   Ordinary residents in US embargoed countries;
*   Otherwise prohibited by applicable export controls and sanctions programmes; and
*   Government officials, including (1) government employees; (2) candidates for public office; and (3) employees of government-owned or government-controlled companies, public international organisations and political parties.

Appropriate conduct and participation
-------------------------------------

As a Local Guide, you must comply with the Universal Terms. By way of example, and not as a limitation, you agree that when using Google’s products or services, you will not:

*   Defame, abuse, harass, stalk, threaten or otherwise violate the legal rights (including the rights of privacy and publicity) of others;
*   Solicit, collect or require the personal information of others;
*   Upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available any unlawful, inappropriate, defamatory or obscene content or message;
*   Trespass, or in any manner attempt to gain or gain access to any property or location where you do not have a right or permission to be;
*   Upload, post or otherwise make available commercial messages or advertisements, pyramid schemes or other disruptive notices;
*   Impersonate another person or entity;
*   Promote or provide instructional information about illegal activities;
*   Promote physical harm or injury against any group or individual;
*   Transmit any viruses, worms, defects, Trojan horses or any items of a destructive nature; or
*   Submit fake, falsified, misleading or inappropriate reviews, edits or removals.

Local Guides must comply with any rules or regulations, as well as applicable laws, while attending an Event.

Local Guides must abide by [Google's anti-harassment policy](https://www.google.com/events/policy/anti-harassmentpolicy.html) both as part of the Programme and at Events. Local Guides will be held accountable for the actions of any guests that they invite to Events and may have their feature access restricted, based on the actions or behaviour of their guests.

Contributions to Google Maps count towards a single Google account and cannot be transferred between owned accounts.

You must not at any time represent yourself in any way as a Google employee or a representative of Google or its products or services.

The Local Guides logo is a Google brand identity and is reserved for official use only. Do not use the Local Guides logo, pin or any other Google imagery in any of your online or offline materials without expressed written permission.

Local Guides Connect content policy
-----------------------------------

Local Guides Connect (collectively referred to as “Connect”) is a platform that enables people from diverse backgrounds to start conversations, share experiences, provide feedback and plan online/offline activities. In order to participate on Connect as a Local Guide, you must be at least 18 years of age. Our policies play an important role in maintaining a positive experience for Local Guides on Connect (collectively referred to as the “Services”). Please follow these policies as you:

*   Use Connect to interact with Local Guides from around the world

*   Use Connect to plan or participate in offline activities/meet-ups such as photo walks, food crawls, geo walks, map editing sessions, etc.
*   Gain access to all/selected boards where privileged information may be shared

We depend heavily upon Local Guides to let us know about content that may violate our policies. After we’re notified of a potential policy violation, we may review the content and take action, including restricting access to the content, removing the content and limiting or terminating the Local Guides’ access and eligibility to contribute to Connect and/or Google products or services. We may make exceptions to these policies based on artistic, educational or documentary considerations, or when there are other substantial benefits to the public from not taking action.

We occasionally modify these policies, so check back here for any updates. These policies apply generally to the content that you post on Connect. Beyond the policies listed below, several products and features may have additional policies and terms. To know additional policies and terms, go to the links below.
