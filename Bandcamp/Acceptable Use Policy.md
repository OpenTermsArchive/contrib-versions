#### **Actions we can take to ensure our website is safe for all users:**

When we consider that a breach of this Acceptable Use Policy has occurred, we may take such action as we deem appropriate.  

We respect freedom of expression, but we also need to ensure that our website is a safe place for all users. All decisions will be made with these principles in mind. We do not use algorithmic tools in making these decisions. All such decisions are made by a team of humans.   

Failure to comply with this Acceptable Use Policy constitutes a material breach of our [User Terms](https://bandcamp.com/terms_of_use) upon which you are permitted to use our site and may result in our taking all or any of the following actions:

*   Immediate, temporary, or permanent withdrawal of your right to use our site.
*   Immediate, temporary, or permanent removal of any Content uploaded by you to our site.
*   Issue of a warning to you.
*   Legal proceedings against you for reimbursement of all costs on an indemnity basis (including, but not limited to, reasonable administrative and legal costs) resulting from the breach.
*   Further legal action against you.
*   Disclosure of such information to law enforcement authorities as we reasonably feel is necessary or as required by law.

If we decide to remove/disable your Content or disable your Bandcamp account, we will provide you with a Statement of Reasons which will explain on what basis we have decided to take that action.  Equally, if we decide not to remove/disable Content despite having received a complaint, we will provide to any affected user (the reporter), a Statement of Reasons to explain on what basis we have decided to take that action.

If we decide that it is appropriate to suspend or prohibit your access to the Site because (a) you are frequently providing what we consider to be manifestly illegal Content, or (b) you are submitting manifestly unfounded takedown notices or complaints, we may restrict your access to the Site as we consider appropriate. 

The actions we may take are not limited to those described above, and we may take any other action we reasonably deem appropriate to protect the other users of the Site and that comply with the law.  To the extent that we can, we exclude our liability for all action we may take in response to breaches of this Acceptable Use Policy.

#### **Actions you can take:**

*   **If you identify any Content that you think contravenes this Acceptable Use Policy,** you can submit a “Take Down Request” through our website by selecting “report” on the posters page or contacting [terms@bandcamp.com](mailto:terms@bandcamp.com). Any report must provide the URL of the offending materials and which policy you believe it violates. A team of humans will review your Take Down Request (no decisions like this are automated), and we will remove the Content if we agree that it is in breach of our Acceptable Use Policy or is in any way unlawful. We will then send to you and anyone else affected by the Take Down Request a Statement of Reasons which will explain why we have made the decision we have made. 
*   **If we have removed or disabled your Content or we have suspended or prohibited your account and you do not think that was the right decision, or you submitted a Take Down Request, and we decided that the content is not in breach of our Acceptable Use Policy, and if you are an EU citizen,** within 6 months of our decision, you can email us at [terms@bandcamp.com](https://terms-escalation@bandcamp.com/) and explain why you think that we are wrong. Your email will then be reviewed by a member of our legal team, and they will aim to reply to you as soon as possible, but in any event, within 8 weeks. They may agree with you and reinstate/remove the Content, or if they think that the Content is still in breach of our Acceptable Use Policy or is otherwise unlawful, they may explain that our decision remains in place. 
*   **If you still do not agree with our decision, and if you are an EU citizen, you may email us at** **[terms](mailto:terms@bandcamp.com)[\-escalation](https://terms-escalation@bandcamp.com/)[@bandcamp.com](mailto:terms@bandcamp.com)** **for attention of senior management. A member of our senior management team will review the decision, and they will aim to reply to you as soon as possible, but in any event, within 8 weeks. They may agree with you and reinstate/remove the Content, or if they think that the Content is still in breach of our Acceptable Use Policy or is otherwise unlawful, they may explain that our decision remains in place.** 
*   **If you do not agree with this further response, and if you are an EU citizen, you can choose to refer the matter to an out-of-court dispute settlement body. We are currently waiting for a list of out-of-court dispute settlement bodies in the European Union to be certified. We will update this website when more information becomes available.** Bandcamp will work with any appointed out-of-court body where required by law to do so. We are not bound by any decisions made by these out-of-court bodies. 
*   **If you do not wish to use the out-of-court dispute settlement body or you have tried that approach,** you also have the option to pursue any claim you may have in court. If you have legal questions or wish to examine legal options that may be available to you, you may want to consult with your own legal counsel.
