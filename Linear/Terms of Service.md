All subscriptions will be for the period described on the applicable Order (“**Subscription Period**”). Use of and access to the Service is permitted only by individuals authorized by Customer and for Customer’s own internal business purposes and not for the benefit of any third party (“**Users**”).

Linear will use commercially reasonable efforts under the circumstances of such suspension to (x) provide Customer with notice and an opportunity to remedy such violation or threat prior to any such suspension; (y) limit the suspension to only accounts involved in the activities in question; and (z) remove the suspension as quickly as practicable after the circumstances leading to the suspension have been resolved.

2.3. API Access Restrictions. As part of provision of its Service, Linear may provide Customer with access to one or more application program interfaces (“**API(s)**”). Linear may, in its sole discretion, set and enforce limits on Customer’s use of the API and Customer agrees to adhere to such limits. Linear may also suspend Customer’s access to the API or cease providing the API at any time.

3\. **Third-Party Applications**. The Service may work together with third party products, services or applications that are not owned or controlled by Linear, (e.g., Github) (“**Third-Party Applications**”) and Customer, at its sole option, may choose to use such Third-Party Applications. If necessary for the Service and the Third-Party Application to work together, Customer will provide its login information to Linear for the sole purpose of Linear providing the Service to Customer and Customer represents and warrants that Customer has the right to provide such login information without breach by Customer of any of the terms and conditions that govern Customer’s use of the applicable Third-Party Application.

Linear will have no liability or other obligation of any kind arising out of or related to any third-party applications, including arising from Customer’s use or inability to use Third-Party Applications.** 

**4\. Payment Obligations.**

4.1. Fees. Customer will pay for access to and use of the Service as set forth on the applicable Order (“**Fees**”). All Fees will be paid in the currency stated in the applicable Order or, if no currency is specified, U.S. dollars. Payment obligations are non-cancelable and, except as expressly stated in this Agreement, non-refundable. Linear may modify its Fees or introduce new fees in its sole discretion. Customer always has the right to choose not to renew its subscription if it does not agree with any new or revised Fees.

4.2. Payment. Linear, either directly or through its third-party payment processor (“**Payment Processor**”) will charge Customer for the Fees via credit card or ACH payment, pursuant to the credit card or ACH payment information provided by Customer to Linear. Linear will have the right to charge Customer’s credit card or ACH payment method for any services provided to Customer by Linear under the Order, including recurring Fees. It is Customer’s sole responsibility to provide Linear with current and up to date credit card or ACH information; failure to provide such information may result in suspension of Customer’s access to the Services. Linear will also have the right to set-off any Fees due from Customer to Linear. If Customer pays the Fees through a Payment Processor such payment processing will be subject to the terms, conditions, and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to this Agreement. Linear is not responsible for any error by, or other acts or omissions of, the Payment Processor. Linear reserves the right to correct any errors or mistakes that the Payment Processor makes even if Linear has already requested or received payment. **If authorized by Customer through acceptance of an Order, recurring charges (e.g. monthly billing) will be charged to Customer’s payment instrument without further authorization from Customer, until Customer terminates this Agreement in accordance with its terms or changes its payment method in Customer’s account in the Service.**

4.3. Taxes. Fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction whatsoever (collectively, “**Taxes**”). Customer is responsible for paying all Taxes associated with its purchases hereunder. If Linear has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which Customer is responsible under this section, Linear will invoice Customer and Customer will pay that amount unless Customer provides Linear with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority in advance. For clarity, Linear is solely responsible for taxes assessable against it based on its income, property, and employees.

4.4. Failure to Pay. If Customer fails to pay any Fees when due, Linear may suspend Customer’s access to the Service pending payment of such overdue amounts. Customer also authorizes Linear to make multiple re-attempts at charging the Customer’s payment instrument if an initial charge attempt is unsuccessful, without any specific limit on the number of retries. If Customer believes that Linear has billed Customer incorrectly, Customer must contact Linear no later than sixty (60) days after the closing date on the first billing statement in which the error or problem appeared, to receive an adjustment or credit. Once Linear receives notice of a disputed invoice, Linear will review such notice and provide Customer with a written decision regarding the dispute, including documentary support for such decision. If Linear reasonably determines that the amounts billed are, in fact, due, Customer will pay such amounts (if it has not done so already) within ten (10) days of Linear notifying Customer in writing of such decision.

**5\. Term and Termination.**

5.1. Agreement Term and Renewals. Subscriptions to access and use the Service commence on the start date stated on the applicable Order(“**Subscription Start Date**”) and continue for the duration of the Subscription Period. Customer may choose not to renew its Subscription Period by notifying Linear at billing@linear.app (provided that Linear confirms such cancellation in writing) or by modifying its subscription through Customer’s account within the Service. This Agreement will become effective on the first day of the Subscription Period and remain effective for the duration of the Subscription Period stated on the Order along with any renewals of the Subscription Period and any period that Customer is using the Service even if such use is not under a paid Order (“Term”). If the parties terminate this Agreement, it will automatically terminate all Orders. If Customer cancels or does not renew its paid subscription to the Service, Customer’s subscription will be accessible but will automatically be downgraded to a version of the Service with diminished features and functionality that Linear offers to unpaid subscribers (“Free Version”). If Customer or Linear terminates this Agreement or Customer deletes its workspace within the Service, Customer will not have access to the Free Version.

Either party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the other party if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and such breach is not cured within thirty (30) days after the breaching party’s receipt of such notice. Linear may terminate Customer’s access to the Free Version at any time upon notice to Customer.

5.3. Effect of Termination. If Customer terminates this Agreement because of Linear’s uncured breach, Linear will refund any unused, prepaid Fees for the remainder of the then-current Subscription Period. If Linear terminates this Agreement because of Customer’s uncured breach, Customer will pay any unpaid Fees covering the remainder of the then-current Subscription Period after the effective date of termination, if any. In no event will any termination relieve Customer of the obligation to pay any Fees payable to Linear for the period prior to the effective date of termination. Upon any termination of this Agreement, all rights and licenses granted by Linear hereunder will immediately terminate; Customer will no longer have the right to access or use the Service. Within thirty (30) days of termination of this Agreement for cause, upon Customer’s request following termination, or if Customer deletes its workspace within the Service, Linear will delete Customer’s User Information, including passwords and all related information, files, and User Submissions, unless Customer requests an earlier deletion in writing. If Customer is using the Free Version, Linear will retain User Submissions and User Information to facilitate such use. Linear may delete all User Submissions or User Information if Customer maintains an account in the Free Version but such account is not usedfor a period of one (1) year or more.

5.4. Survival. Sections titled “Linear’s Ownership”, “Third-Party Applications”, “Payment Obligations”, “Term and Termination”, “Warranty Disclaimer”, “Limitation of Liability”, “Confidentiality”, “Data” and “General Terms” will survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.
