==========================================================

(a) How do I deactivate my account?
-----------------------------------

If you are a registered user of the Services, you can deactivate your membership at any time by going to the Settings control when you are logged in and choosing the “deactivate profile” link. By deactivating your account, it will no longer be visible to other users of the Services, but we will save your profile information in case you change your mind later and want to reactivate your account. Many members deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and in doing so expect us to maintain their information until they return to the Services. You should, therefore, be able to restore your account and the whole of your profile within 12 months of deactivating it, but we cannot guarantee that this will always be the case.

(b) How do I actually terminate my account, not just deactivate it?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Should you choose to leave the Services, rather than deactivate your account, you may do so by selecting the “I want to leave ASKfm” tab on the [Contact Us](http://support.ask.fm/) page. Once received, we will process your request to leave as soon as practicable. Once processed, your profile data will be removed from the Services and your questions to friends will be converted to anonymous questions (in other words, questions you have asked will remain visible but will appear to be from an anonymous user). You will be able to reactivate your account by logging back in for a period of 30 days after your request to leave the Services is processed. At the end of that period, your account will be deleted and all “likes” which you have added to questions will be removed. We will delete your data as soon as reasonably practicable, but in certain cases, limited types of data, including log files and backups, may take up to 90 days to be fully deleted.

Warning: After you have deactivated your account or left the Services, questions may still appear on the Services, but will be anonymized and no longer associated with you directly (in other words, a question you asked on your friend’s profile will still be visible, but will not include your username). Please note also that even after you remove information from your profile or deactivate your account, copies of such content may still be visible and/or accessed on the Internet to the extent such information has been previously shared with others, or to the extent such information has been shared with, indexed by or cached by search engines. Similarly, if you have given third-party applications or websites (e.g., social networks) access to your personal information, they may keep that information. We cannot control this, nor do we accept any responsibility or liability for this.

(c) Can you suspend or terminate my account if you want to?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Yes, we can. We may suspend or terminate a user’s access to the Services or a member’s account for any reason, including if we believe a user has violated these TOU. We also reserve the right to at any time block users from accessing and using the Services by using IP blockers or other technological solutions we deem appropriate. If we have grounds to terminate your access to the Services due to a violation of these TOU (including your breach of the Rules of Conduct), we reserve the right to terminate your access to the Services without notice. Otherwise, we will provide you with reasonable notice, if your access to the Services and/or your profile is going to be suspended or terminated.

(d) What are the effects of termination?
----------------------------------------

Upon termination or expiration of your rights to use the Services or any portion thereof, you authorize us to delete any files, programs, data and messages associated with your account for the Services, or applicable portion thereof, without notice to you.

9E. How do you handle Copyright Claims? 
----------------------------------------

It is our policy to respond to clear notices of alleged copyright or other IP rights infringement, and in appropriate circumstances and at our discretion, to disable and/or terminate the accounts of users who may infringe or repeatedly infringe the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of ASKfm and/or others.

(a) Notice for Claims of Intellectual Property Violations and Agent for Notice.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This process is for copyright and intellectual property matters only and is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to ASKfm as straightforward as possible, while also providing ASKfm with the necessary information for notice verification. If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement or that your intellectual property rights have been otherwise violated, please provide ASKfm’s Copyright Agent with a written communication containing the following information in English (your “Notice”):

Note: If you are asserting infringement of an intellectual property right other than copyright, you should specify the intellectual property right at issue.

1\. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;

2\. A detailed description sufficient to identify the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed, or if multiple works have been infringed, a representative list of such works on the ASKfm site;

3\. A description of the material that you claim is infringing and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate this material on the ASKfm site (as part of this information, you must provide us with the specific URL where the material is located);

4\. Information sufficient for ASKfm to contact you, including your username (if applicable), address, telephone number, and/or email address;

5\. A statement by you that you have a good-faith belief that the disputed use of the material is not authorized by the copyright or intellectual property owner, its agents, or the law;

6\. A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury (if you are located in the US) or made truthfully (if you are located elsewhere) that the information in this notice is accurate and that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner for the material or that you are authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual property owner’s behalf.

(b) What happens to my copyright claim notice?
----------------------------------------------

In some circumstances, in order to notify the subscriber, account holder or host who provided the allegedly infringing content to which ASKfm has disabled access (or intends to disable access), ASKfm may forward a copy of your notification including your name and contact information to the subscriber or account holder. The individual may choose to file a counter-notification explaining why the content does not infringe an IP right following receipt of our notice. We may also, in our sole discretion, post a notice or a copy of your complaint on our site. By providing us with a complaint, you are consenting to your complaint being forwarded to the subscriber, account holder or host who provided the allegedly infringing content, and/or to our posting a notice or copy of your complaint on our site.

(c) What if I change my mind or make a false copyright claim?
-------------------------------------------------------------

After submitting a copyright or other IP right, infringement notification, you may realize that you misidentified content or you might otherwise change your mind. ASKfm will honour retractions of copyright or other IP claims from the party who originally submitted them. It is important that you do not make false claims. Submitting a claim of copyright or other IP right infringement is a serious matter with legal consequences. Before you report a claim of copyright or other IP right infringement to us, you may wish to reach out to the individual posting the content. You may be able to resolve the issue simply by bringing it to their attention without contacting us at all. If you are unsure whether the content you are reporting is infringing your legal rights, you may wish to seek legal guidance. Keep in mind that submitting intentionally misleading reports of infringement may be punishable under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in the United States or similar laws in other countries.

(d) Who is the ASKfm copyright agent for DMCA purposes?
