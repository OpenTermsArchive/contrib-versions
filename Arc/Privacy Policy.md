Overview

A Letter to all Arc Users,

Welcome to privacy at the Browser Company. To us, privacy means a web browser that the people we know and love can feel safe using. It means you don't have to worry that your data is being misused, misappropriated, or bought and sold in ways you're not aware of. It means we're not now, not ever, in the business of profiting from your data.

We care about your privacy and want to be upfront about how we treat your personal data: what we do collect, why we collect it, where it all goes, and for how long. So we wrote this privacy policy to explain it to you in the clearest, simplest way we know how.

In addition to this privacy policy, please read our [Terms of Service](https://start.arc.net/terms-of-use) which also applies to your use of the product. It's also where you can find any terms not directly defined in this policy.

One more reminder before you get started. We care about your privacy, but unfortunately, not everyone on the internet does. Just because we don't collect a particular piece of information doesn't mean websites you visit or services you use won't try to. We do offer settings and tools to help you limit the information collected by other websites—read the section "Additional Ways to Enhance Privacy Online" below for more.

You can print a copy of this Privacy Policy by clicking here. if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or suggestions, give us a shout at [\[email protected\]](https://arc.net/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). We're all ears!

What personal data do we collect?
---------------------------------

Before we get into the details, we want you to know that "Personal Data" includes any information that identifies or relates to a particular individual (often referred to "personal information," "personally identifiable information" or "PII"). Data that is de-identified or anonymized (in other words, it can't identify you) is NOT considered Personal Data. The Personal Data we collect about you will vary depending on your relationship with us.

  

### When you visit our websites, [arc.net](https://arc.net/) or [thebrowser.company](https://thebrowser.company/)

We do NOT use advertising or similar tracking technologies on our website. To measure site traffic, we sought out a privacy-first service provider. Our provider uses IP addresses to maintain unique visitor counts and the geographic distribution of the site traffic. However, they're contractually obligated not to collect any other Personal Data or sell your Personal Data.

  

### When you reach out directly or otherwise choose to give us feedback or other information

For instance, when you submit a bug report or request support, we'll collect the information you share with us to help solve your problem. Specifically, if you submit a bug report, we'll automatically collect the names of browser extensions you have installed in case they're responsible for the issue you're reporting.

  

### When you purchase products such as merchandise, stickers, or the Arc Manual

You will have to provide certain payment information such as your payment card number (we can only access the last 4 digits) and billing address, phone number and email. This information is predominantly processed by our payment processor, Stripe, Inc. ("Stripe").

  

### When you sign up for an Arc account and use our Browser

We will collect certain profile or contact information, such as your name and email address, IP/device data such as your IP address (and related, general, location data), and the type of device and operating system used to access our Services. We may also collect certain product usage data, such as how often you use various product features. Additionally, additional data or processing may apply to specific Browser products or features, as described below:

*   **Easels.** Easels allow you to create content, including text, images, and links. When you create an Easel, it's automatically stored so that you can access it on other devices. We do not use or access your Easels for anything other than displaying your content to you. If you decide to share an Easel publicly, it will be viewable by anyone with the link.
*   **Boosts.** Boosts are a feature of Arc that lets you customize your web interface including changing the colors, fonts, and even removing entire sections from sites. Similarly to Easels, Boosts are automatically stored with our Service Provider so that you can access them on other devices.
*   **Sharing features.** For some features of Arc, like Easels and Folders, you can optionally create arc.net links that allow you to share those objects with others. If you choose to opt in to share an object, data about that object (for example, the title of the folder and the URLs it contains) is automatically stored with our Service Provider, and the content will be viewable by anyone with the link. When someone opens this link, we collect anonymous statistics about their usage.
*   **Sidebar sync.** If you choose to sync your sidebar via Arc Sync, data about your sidebar items will be encrypted and sent to our cloud provider. This data is end-to-end encrypted, and no one except you can view it. [Learn more here](https://resources.arc.net/hc/en-us/articles/20272860828823-Arc-Sync). You can switch from iCloud to Arc Sync, or turn syncing off, in the desktop app in Settings.
*   **Third-party connections.** Some features of the Browser rely on third-party APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for their functionality. In these instances, the Browser directly connects you with the third party. If you choose to use these features, the third party may receive certain data as detailed below. This data never passes through our servers, and we have no way of knowing its contents.
    *   **Website translation:** If you choose to use the website translation feature, the text to be translated will be sent to the Google Translate API.
    *   **Search suggestions:** When you type search queries or URLs, the Browser fetches search suggestions from your default search engine. Search suggestions are on by default when you install the Browser. In the desktop app, you can change your default search engine or turn off search suggestions in Preferences > General. In the mobile app, the default search engine is Google and cannot be changed at this time.
    *   **Google Calendar and Outlook Previews:** Previews allow you to glance at top sites without leaving your current tab. If you choose to connect your Google account to the Google Calendar Preview or Microsoft account to an Outlook preview, you will be prompted to sign in and grant certain permissions to Arc. If you allow access, Arc will read and display this information in the Preview. We do not store any of this information on our servers or use it for any other purpose. You can read more about your Google Calendar data in the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes).

  

### When you use certain Arc Max features

When you use certain Arc Max features certain personal data will be sent to either or both of our service providers, OpenAI and Anthropic, relevant to the particular feature:

*   **Tidy Tab/Tidy Tab Titles:** When enabled, tabs you pin will be renamed to help keep you organized throughout the day and pressing the broom icon will organize your tabs into groups. These features involve the sharing of your name of tab title, tab URL to be shared.
*   **Tidy Downloads:** When enabled, files you download will be renamed to help keep you organized throughout the day. This involves the sharing of the name of tab title, filename of downloaded file.
*   **5-Second Previews:** When enabled, hovering over a URL will provide a summary of the webpage. This requires sharing the contents of that webpage.
*   **ChatGPT in the Command Bar:** When enabled, asking a question in the command bar via ChatGPT site search will open an answer in ChatGPT. This involves sharing the content of the command bar.
*   **Ask on Page:** When enabled, asking a question about a webpage will provide an answer based on the content of that page. This involves sharing the content of the relevant webpage and webpage URL.
*   **Instant Links:** When enabled, the top search results will be instantly opened. This involves the sharing the content of the command.

  

### When you use Browse for Me

Browse for Me provides AI-generated summaries of webpages related to your search query. To provide this feature, content of the command bar, and content search results are shared with our service provider, OpenAI.

How we collect personal data
----------------------------

We collect your personal data from you either directly when you provide to us (such as when you create an account), from our service providers (such as OpenAI or Anthropic if you are using certain AI-powered features), or automatically when you use our Services (such as information regarding the device on which you're accessing our Services).

Our purposes for processing personal data
-----------------------------------------

We process your personal data to provide you with the Services. This could include:

*   Creating and managing your account or other user profiles.
*   Processing orders or other transactions; billing.
*   Providing you with the Services or information you request.
*   Meeting or fulfilling the reason you provided the information to us.
*   Providing support and assistance for the Services.
*   Communicating with you in connection with our Services.

In addition, we may also process your personal data in relation to the following legal purposes:

*   meet certain legal requirements and enforcing legal terms
*   fulfilling our legal obligations under applicable law, regulation, court order or other legal process,
*   preventing, detecting and investigating security incidents and potentially illegal or prohibited activities;
*   protecting the rights, property or safety of you, us, or another party;
*   enforcing any agreements with you; and
*   responding to claims that any posting or other content violates third-party rights; and resolving disputes.

We will not collect additional categories of personal data or use the personal data we collected for materially different, unrelated or incompatible purposes without providing you notice or obtaining your consent.

How we may disclose your personal data
--------------------------------------

We will only disclose your personal data to the following parties:

*   **Service Providers,** These trusted partners help us provide Arc and support our business, such as
    *   Hosting, technology and communication providers.
    *   Analytics providers that help us analyze usage of our Services.
    *   Security and fraud prevention consultants.
    *   Support and customer service vendors. OpenAI and/or Anthropic, if you are using our AI-powered features.
*   **Parties You Authorize, Access or Authenticate**
    *   Third parties you access through the Services.
    *   Other users or individuals you share information with.

However, we may need to provide your Personal Data to third parties under certain circumstances, including:

*   If required to fulfil the legal purposes described in the section above,
*   If we undergo a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or other transaction in which that third party assumes control of our business (in whole or in part).

Data that is not personal data
------------------------------

We may create aggregated, de-identified, or anonymized data from the personal data we collect. We would do so by removing information that makes the data personally identifiable to a particular user. We may use such aggregated, de-identified, or anonymized data and disclose it with third parties for our lawful business purposes, including to analyze, build, and improve our Services and promote our business, provided that we will not disclose such data in a manner that could identify you.

How we store and protect your personal data
-------------------------------------------

We keep personal data for as long as necessary to provide our Services, to perform our business, or commercial purposes for collecting your personal data. When deciding how long to retain specific types of data, we consider who the data came from, whether we need it, why we collected the personal data, and how sensitive it is. We may keep personal data for longer, if needed to meet with legal obligations, resolve disputes, collect fees owed, or as otherwise allowed or required by applicable law. We may also retain information in an anonymous, de-identified, or aggregated form where that information would not identify you personally.

For example:

*   We retain your profile information and credentials for as long as you have an account with us.
*   We retain your IP/device data for as long as we need it to ensure that our systems are working appropriately, effectively and efficiently.

As an important reminder, Arc's data practices may not extend to the websites you visit when using our browser, which we can't control. We do offer settings and tools to help you limit the information collected by websites you visit. You can change your default search engine and settings for search suggestions by going to Arc > Preferences > General > Privacy Preferences to control cookies and change other privacy and security settings. In the General preferences window, you can also change your default search engine and turn search suggestions on and off. Another way to protect your personal data is to practice password hygiene around your credentials such as by avoiding repetitive patterns, duplicating passwords, and rotating passwords on a regular basis.

Children's data
---------------

As noted in our [Terms of Service](https://start.arc.net/terms-of-use), we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal data about children under 16 years of age; if you are a child under the age of 16, please do not attempt to register for or otherwise use the services or send us any personal data. if we learn we have collected personal data from a child under 16 years of age, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. if you believe that a child under 16 years of age may have provided personal data to us, please contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://arc.net/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).
