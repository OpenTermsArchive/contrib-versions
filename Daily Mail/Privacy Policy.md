#### Personalisation / identifying your interests / audience segmentation / audience conversion / ecommerce activities

We use your information, including your UID, to provide you with a greater personalised experience when you visit or use one of our sites or apps, and for insight and marketing purposes.

We make assumptions and draw inferences about your interests based on the kind of articles and content you click on or read.

We use this information to segment our audiences into groups with attributes. This helps us show you more relevant content/adverts and helps our advertisers target more effectively.

Our partner, Piano, assists us in understanding user journeys (e.g. which pages our users are visiting the most, which pages lead to the greatest audience conversion, etc.), user session length on our website/app, testing the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns, and optimising our website/app based on audience data. Please see Piano’s [Privacy Policy](https://piano.io/privacy-policy/) and [GDPR](https://piano.io/gdpr/) policy.

Please note you have the right to object to profiling for marketing purposes at any time. If you wish to opt-out of having your personal information profiled for personalisation purposes, you can do so via the Cookie Settings.

##### Legal basis for this processing activity: Consent (if requested) or legitimate interests

#### Cookie Matching

Where you have given consent, we check to see if you have a cookie ID when you visit one of our properties. We are then able to compare the cookie ID we have to see if we know who you are. See Section 14 on Cookies for more information.

##### Legal basis for this processing activity: Consent

#### Data matching and lookalike audience building

We allow partners to reach audiences on our platforms via data matching where they have appropriate permissions. We use your UID (together with other associated personal data such as email address) to carry out such data matching. This is conducted at an aggregate level or an individual level, depending on how targeted our partners want to reach audiences on our platforms. Your UID is stored with an independent third party data management platform (DMP) who will match UIDs with the data from advertisers with whom we partner. This matching is based on common identifiers (such as email address). This matching is completed using a data clean room where neither we nor the advertiser will have access to each other’s data.

The data overlap between our audiences and these partners is useful to understand if an advertising campaign would be effective.

As part of the matching process, we segment audiences based on predefined attributes. These audiences may be similar to our partners’ existing audiences and are therefore called “lookalike audiences”. For example, a female fashion brand may want to reach “women interested in fashion”. This helps them find the right audiences and we are able to show you more relevant advertising.

You may amend your settings in order to avoid UID matching taking place in the future by contacting us (see Section 17 below) or by adjusting your account settings.

##### Legal basis for this processing activity: Consent (if requested) or legitimate interests

#### Tailored advertising

We use advertising to fund some of our websites and apps. Some advertising is ‘contextual’ meaning it is shown due to the particular webpage you are presently viewing. Other advertising, known as “online behavioural advertising” is shown to you based upon your likely interests, which are inferred from your browsing history. This information is collected through the use of cookies and similar technologies or your UID. For more information on controlling your tailored advertising preferences, please see Section 14 on Cookies below.

Sometimes we allow advertisers to show advertisements directly on our website and apps, which are tailored to you based upon information they have obtained, such as your browsing history on their own websites.

Other times we shall arrange for our customers to be shown advertisements on our own or other websites or apps. These advertisements are tailored to you with information we have obtained from your browsing on our websites and apps via cookies.

Where we arrange for our customers to be shown advertisements, we use technological and contractual mechanisms to protect your cookie data and to ensure that your browsing data used for advertising is not used by advertisers or other website owners for other purposes, such as linking online behavioural advertising data with your contact details, unless you have provided the advertiser or other website with your express permission to do this.

When you are shown an advertisement, our advertising systems do not know who you are or your contact details (such as your name, email address or postal address).

Your IP address may also be used, in connection with our legitimate interests to tailor the advertising we arrange to be shown.

We may also target advertising on social media sites to specifically include customers who have registered for our products and services.

##### Legal basis for this processing activity: Consent (if requested) or legitimate interests

#### Location based services and advertising

Where we provide services that utilise your device’s location, such as local weather or news, your location will be determined either from a lookup of your IP address in a “GeoIP” database which lists information provided by your ISP (usually your closest town or borough).

Sometimes we can collect the precise location directly from the device (such as through GPS or Wi-Fi on mobile devices) but only where you have granted permission for us to access this location information via your device settings. We use such information to provide you with a more tailored, relevant experiences when using our websites/apps.

##### Legal basis for this processing activity: Consent (if requested) or legitimate interests

#### Ad blocker detection

We collect information from your device to detect whether you’re using an ad blocker. This is to determine if we are able to show you advertising. As an advertising funded publisher, we rely on the ability to show you advertising.

##### Legal basis for this processing activity: Legitimate interests

#### Surveys and market research

We collect information via online survey units (Pulse Poll) and via our online research community of our readers (Matters Community) to help us better understand our readers and how they engage with the advertising they are shown. We collect this information when you voluntarily contribute or we invite you to contribute to any of our surveys, polls or forum discussions on our websites or online research community, for example when we ask you questions about your behaviour or response to adverts seen. We will also use your responses to our surveys, polls or forum discussions to send you targeted advertising, where we have your permission to do so.

#### What are cookies and how do they work?

Cookies are small files that are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Your browser sends these cookies back to the website every time you visit the site again, so it can recognise you. This allows websites to tailor what you see on the screen.

#### Do you use other technologies which are similar to cookies?

Yes, we use the following:

* **Web beacons:** Our websites, apps and emails often contain small invisible images known as “**web beacons**” or “**tracking pixels**”. These are used in a way similar to cookies to:
    * understand when a particular part of a webpage, email or app is viewed;
    * understand how successful an article or an email marketing campaign has been; and
    * verify any clicks through to links or advertisements contained in emails.
* **Tracking URLs:** These are web links that allows us to measure when a link is clicked on. They help us measure the effectiveness of campaigns and advertising and the popularity of articles that are read.
* **Device identifiers:** We use device identifiers on mobile devices in the same way as cookies are used on web browsers. A device identifier is a unique number on your device which allow us to remember your device.

We use these similar technologies on websites, emails and apps, for the same purposes and in much the same way as we use cookies on websites. We shall use “**cookies**” and “**websites**” below as shorthand for “cookies and similar technologies” on “websites, emails and in apps”.

#### What do you use cookies for?

Cookies and other online tracking technologies are an important part of the internet. They make using websites much smoother and affect lots of the useful features of websites.

#### Cookies that are needed to provide the service you have asked for (Essential / Strictly Necessary)

Some cookies are essential so you can move around our websites and use their features. Without the use of these cookies parts of our websites would not function. For example:

These cookies collect information about your choices and preferences, and allow us to remember things like:

* if you have filled in a survey, so you’re not asked to do it again; and
* showing “related article” links that are relevant to the page you are looking at.

#### Cookies used to understand how people use our products and services (Analytics)

We use analytics cookies to gather information about what pages, links and sections of our apps are popular and which ones do not get used so much to help us keep our sites relevant and up to date. They are also useful to be able to identify trends of how people navigate our sites so we can identify improvements to make to the customer journey.

We may combine information collected by analytics cookies with other information that you provide to us. For instance, if you have registered for an account with us, we may combine your contact details other information you provide us with the browsing history from your device collected by analytics cookies (including data collected from before you registered and when you are signed-out).

We may also use this combined information to improve our products and services. For instance, we may analyse this information in aggregate to improve our advertising systems.

* know how many advertisements we serve, how many times these are clicked or hovered over with a mouse cursor, how many advertisements we show to a given user and how many customer actions these generate;
* understand which customers reach a sale or other action page on an advertiser’s site. This allows us to monitor how many sales or actions we achieve for an advertising client, and therefore, how effective our advertising is; and
* protect our advertisers’ brands, we often use a technology that scans the page to ascertain that it is safe from profane, sensitive and potentially brand-negative topics, before serving an ad there. This process is called “**ad verification**”.

**Ad-blockers:** We and our advertisers may use information from within our webpages to determine whether you have an ad-blocker enabled. This information may be stored or associated with your device (including through the use of cookies) to re-insert advertisements on our websites and to understand how our customers use ad-blockers.
