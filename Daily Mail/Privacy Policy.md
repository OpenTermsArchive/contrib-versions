For further information, please see the next section (“**Personalisation / identifying your interests / audience segmentation / audience conversion / ecommerce activities**”).

This may include communications by email, post, telephone, SMS or app notifications about our products and services, events and special offers.

##### Legal basis for processing this data: Consent (if requested) or legitimate interests

#### Personalisation / identifying your interests / audience segmentation / audience conversion / ecommerce activities

We use your information, including your UID and Usage Data, as described below, to provide you with a greater personalised experience when you visit or use one of our sites or apps, and for insight and marketing purposes.

We make assumptions and draw inferences about attributes and your interests based on the kind of articles and content you click on or read. We may also assess your level of engagement with our articles and content.

We use this information to divide (or “segment”) our users and customers into groups that are likely to share certain attributes or interests (these groups are also known as “audiences”). This helps us show you more relevant content/adverts and helps our advertisers target more effectively. It also helps to assist us in our marketing efforts by ensuring that our marketing communications are sent to those people who are most likely to engage with our content.

Our partner, Piano, assists us in understanding user journeys (e.g. which pages our users are visiting the most, which pages lead to the greatest audience conversion, etc.), user session length on our website/app, testing the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns, and optimising our website/app based on audience data. Please see Piano’s [Privacy Policy](https://piano.io/privacy-policy/) and [GDPR](https://piano.io/gdpr/) policy.

Please note you have the right to object to profiling for marketing purposes at any time. If you wish to opt-out of having your personal information profiled for personalisation purposes, you can do so via the [Privacy Settings](#).

##### Legal basis for this processing activity: Consent (if requested) or legitimate interests

#### Cookie Matching

Where you have given consent, we check to see if you have a cookie ID when you visit one of our properties. We are then able to compare the cookie ID we have to see if we know who you are. See Section 15 on Cookies for more information.

##### Legal basis for this processing activity: Consent

#### Data matching and lookalike audience building

We allow partners to reach audiences on our platforms via data matching where they have appropriate permissions. We use your UID (together with other associated personal data such as email address) to carry out such data matching. This is conducted at an aggregate level or an individual level, depending on how targeted our partners want to reach audiences on our platforms. Your UID is stored with an independent third party data management platform (DMP) who will match UIDs with the data from advertisers with whom we partner. This matching is based on common identifiers (such as email address). This matching is completed using a data clean room where neither we nor the advertiser will have access to each other’s data.

The data overlap between our audiences and these partners is useful to understand if an advertising campaign would be effective.

As part of the matching process, we segment audiences based on predefined attributes. These audiences may be similar to our partners’ existing audiences and are therefore called “lookalike audiences”. For example, a female fashion brand may want to reach “women interested in fashion”. This helps them find the right audiences and we are able to show you more relevant advertising.

You may amend your settings in order to avoid UID matching taking place in the future by contacting us (see Section 18 below) or by adjusting your account settings.

##### Legal basis for this processing activity: Consent (if requested) or legitimate interests

#### Tailored advertising

We use advertising to fund some of our websites and apps. Some advertising is ‘contextual’ meaning it is shown due to the particular webpage you are presently viewing. Other advertising, known as “online behavioural advertising” is shown to you based upon your likely interests, which are inferred from your browsing history. This information is collected through the use of cookies and similar technologies or your UID. For more information on controlling your tailored advertising preferences, please see Section 15 on Cookies below.

Sometimes we allow advertisers to show advertisements directly on our website and apps, which are tailored to you based upon information they have obtained, such as your browsing history on their own websites.

Other times we shall arrange for our customers to be shown advertisements on our own or other websites or apps. These advertisements are tailored to you with information we have obtained from your browsing on our websites and apps via cookies.

Where we arrange for our customers to be shown advertisements, we use technological and contractual mechanisms to protect your cookie data and to ensure that your browsing data used for advertising is not used by advertisers or other website owners for other purposes, such as linking online behavioural advertising data with your contact details, unless you have provided the advertiser or other website with your express permission to do this.

When you are shown an advertisement, our advertising systems do not know who you are or your contact details (such as your name, email address or postal address).

Your IP address may also be used, in connection with our legitimate interests to tailor the advertising we arrange to be shown.

We may also target advertising on social media sites to specifically include customers who have registered for our products and services.

##### Legal basis for this processing activity: Consent (if requested) or legitimate interests

#### Location based services and advertising

Where we provide services that utilise your device’s location, such as local weather or news, your location will be determined either from a lookup of your IP address in a “GeoIP” database which lists information provided by your ISP (usually your closest town or borough).

Sometimes we can collect the precise location directly from the device (such as through GPS or Wi-Fi on mobile devices) but only where you have granted permission for us to access this location information via your device settings. We use such information to provide you with a more tailored, relevant experiences when using our websites/apps.

Where you have granted permission to access your device’s location and consented to us to use your data for advertising purposes, this location information may be used to tailor the advertising you receive, including showing you certain advertisements when you are in the vicinity of a particular location.

We may use certain information (such as the websites that you visit and advertisements you see or click on and emails you interact with) to help us, advertisers and other promotional partners measure the effectiveness and distributions of their advertisements and promotions as well as the effectiveness of our own services and communications.

##### Legal basis for this processing activity: Consent (if requested) or legitimate interests

#### Ad blocker detection

We collect information from your device to detect whether you’re using an ad blocker. This is to determine if we are able to show you advertising. As an advertising funded publisher, we rely on the ability to show you advertising.

##### Legal basis for this processing activity: Legitimate interests

#### Surveys and market research

We collect information via online survey units (Pulse Poll) and via our online research community of our readers (Matters Community) to help us better understand our readers and how they engage with the advertising they are shown. We collect this information when you voluntarily contribute or we invite you to contribute to any of our surveys, polls or forum discussions on our websites or online research community, for example when we ask you questions about your behaviour or response to adverts seen. We will also use your responses to our surveys, polls or forum discussions to send you targeted advertising, where we have your permission to do so. How we use data relating to our online survey units is covered by this Policy. For more information about how we use data relating to our online research community, please see our separate [Matters Community Privacy Policy](https://matterscommunity.co.uk/p/privacy).

### 6\. If you fail to provide your personal data
