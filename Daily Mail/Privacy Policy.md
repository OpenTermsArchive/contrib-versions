during the 12 months preceding the request.

Upon receipt of a valid and verifiable request from you, we will disclose to you both the categories and specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you, the categories of sources from which the personal information is collected, the business or commercial purpose for collecting that personal information, the categories of third parties which whom we share that information. 

You have a right to receive the above twice per year. If we provide the information electronically, it will be in a in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily useable format that allows you to transmit the information to another entity without hindrance from us. 

• request that we delete any personal information that we have collected from you unless retention of that information is permitted under applicable law

You can opt-out of the sale of your personal information by opening our [California Privacy Settings](javascript:(window.__cmp||window.__uspapi).a.push(['openSettings'])) tool and clicking on the “Do Not Sell my Info” button. This will opt-you out of cookie placement and the collection of your data by online advertising service providers.

Alternatively, you can make your request through the technical support option on our [Contact Us](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/contactus/index.html) page.

In order to process your deletion and/or access request, we are required by law to collect certain information about you to verify your identity.

We shall not discriminate against you because you have exercised your rights under the CCPA.

10. Data retention and account deletion
---------------------------------------

 We store your data for no longer than necessary in relation to the purpose under which such data was collected. This is determined on a case by case basis and depends on things such as the nature of the data provided, why it was collected, the legal basis we rely upon to process the data, and our relevant legal or operation retention requirements. For example, if you request to delete your account, we still have to retain some data for fraud prevention purposes and financial auditing.

Please note that we evaluate deletion requests against our processing for the purposes of journalism, which includes original content and accompanying comments. When we receive a request to delete your personal data from our organisation, we are prepared to anonymise your comments by removing your email address and alias from your public account profile. In doing so, your comments are disassociated with your public account profile and therefore you are no longer publicly identified as the author of your comments. However, we keep your data because we may receive claims for libel and or/defamation in relation to user comments.
