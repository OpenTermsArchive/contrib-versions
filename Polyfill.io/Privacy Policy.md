We collect and use personal information in different ways for the Site and the Service. This Privacy Policy sets out details of these different ways in which we collect and use information.

**The Service:** What information do we collect from the Service?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Service is a hosted instance of software known as Polyfill Service. Polyfill Service provides snippets of code, called “polyfills”, that allows websites to provide a consistent experience across different browsers. When you load a web page which uses Polyfill Service, your browser will download any polyfills required in order to present the web page successfully in your browser.

In order to provide the polyfills, the Service receives certain technical information from your browser including:

* browser details;
* connection details, such as your IP address, which can identify your approximate location and/or name of your ISP;
* the URL of the web page which has made the request to the Service.

We use the above information to determine which polyfills are required by your browser. We do not retain this information.

We may retain the following information:

* obfuscated IP addresses, this is an IP address with the last 3 digits removed or masked in order to anonymise it;
* the domain of the web page which has made the request to the Service;
* the user agent string for your browser;
* the set of polyfills that were requested by the web page;
* the URL and HTTP method used to access the service.

The information we retain cannot identify you. We retain it in order to identify which websites are using the Service and whether any websites are abusing the Service.
