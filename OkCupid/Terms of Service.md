3\. CONTENT
-----------

**_It is important that you understand your rights and responsibilities with regard to the content on our Services, including any content you provide or post. You are expressly prohibited from posting inappropriate content._**

While using our Services, you will have access to: (i) content that you upload or provide while using our Services (“Your Content”); (ii) content that other users upload or provide while using our Services (“Member Content”); and (iii) content that OkCupid provides on and through our Services (“Our Content”). In this agreement, “content” includes, without limitation, all text, images, video, audio, or other material on our Services, including information on users’ profiles and in direct messages between users.

### 3a. YOUR CONTENT

**_You are responsible for Your Content. Don’t share anything that you wouldn’t want others to see, that would violate this Agreement, or that may expose you or us to legal liability._**

You are solely responsible and liable for Your Content, and, therefore, you agree to indemnify, defend, release, and hold us harmless from any claims made in connection with Your Content.

You may not display any personal contact or banking information, whether in relation to you or any other person (for example, names, home addresses or postcodes, telephone numbers, email addresses, URLs, credit/debit card or other banking details). If you choose to reveal any personal information about yourself to other users, you do so at your own risk. We encourage you to use caution in disclosing any personal information online.

Your individual profile will be visible to other people around the world, so be sure that you are comfortable sharing Your Content before you post. You acknowledge and agree that Your Content may be viewed by other users, and, notwithstanding these Terms, other users may share Your Content with third parties. By uploading Your Content, you represent and warrant to us that you have all necessary rights and licenses to do so and automatically grant us a license to use Your Content as provided under Section 7 below.

You understand and agree that we may monitor or review Your Content, and we have the right to remove, delete, edit, limit, or block or prevent access to any of Your Content at any time in our sole discretion. Furthermore, you understand agree that we have no obligation to display or review Your Content.

### 3b. MEMBER CONTENT

**_While you will have access to Member Content, it is not yours and you may not copy or use Member Content for any purpose except as contemplated by these Terms._**

Other users will also share content on our Services. Member Content belongs to the user who posted the content and is stored on our servers and displayed at the direction of that user.

You do not have any rights in relation to Member Content, and you may only use Member Content to the extent that your use is consistent with our Services’ purpose of allowing use to communicate with and meet one another. You may not copy the Member Content or use Member Content for commercial purposes, to spam, to harass, or to make unlawful threats. We reserve the right to terminate your account if you misuse Member Content.

### 3c. OUR CONTENT

**_OkCupid owns all other content on our Services._**

Any other text, content, graphics, user interfaces, trademarks, logos, sounds, artwork, images, and other intellectual property appearing on our Services is owned, controlled or licensed by us and protected by copyright, trademark and other intellectual property law rights.

By using our Services, you agree that we may use your personal data in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://okcupid.com/legal/privacy).

6\. RIGHTS YOU ARE GRANTED BY OKCUPID
-------------------------------------

**_OkCupid grants you the right to use and enjoy our Services, subject to these Terms._**

For as long as you comply with these Terms, OkCupid grants you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, revocable, and non-sublicensable license to access and use our Services for purposes as intended by OkCupid and permitted by these Terms and applicable laws.

7\. RIGHTS YOU GRANT OKCUPID
----------------------------

**_You own all of the content you provide to OkCupid, but you also grant us the right to use Your Content as provided in this Agreement._**

By creating an account, you grant to OkCupid a worldwide, perpetual, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free right and license to host, store, use, copy, display, reproduce, adapt, edit, publish, translate, modify, and distribute Your Content, including any information you authorize us to access from Facebook or other third-party source (if applicable), in whole or in part, and in any format or medium currently known or developed in the future. OkCupid’s license to Your Content shall be non-exclusive, except that OkCupid’s license shall be exclusive with respect to derivative works created through use of our Services. For example, OkCupid would have an exclusive license to screenshots of our Services that include Your Content.

In addition, so that OkCupid can prevent the use of Your Content outside of our Services, you authorize OkCupid to act on your behalf with respect to infringing uses of Your Content taken from our Services by other users or third parties. This expressly includes the authority, but not the obligation, to send notices pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3) (i.e., DMCA Takedown Notices) on your behalf if Your Content is taken and used by third parties outside of our Services. OkCupid is not obligated to take any action with regard to use of Your Content by other users or third parties. OkCupid’s license to Your Content is subject to your rights under applicable law (for example, laws regarding personal data protection to the extent the content contains personal information as defined by those laws).

In consideration for OkCupid allowing you to use our Services, you agree that we, our affiliates, and our third-party partners may place advertising on our Services. By submitting suggestions or feedback to OkCupid regarding our Services, you agree that OkCupid may use and share such feedback for any purpose without compensating you.

You agree that OkCupid may access, preserve, and disclose your account information, including Your Content, if required to do so by law or upon a good faith belief that such access, preservation, or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with legal process; (ii) enforce these Terms; (iii) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; (iv) respond to your requests for customer service; or (v) protect the rights, property or personal safety of the Company or any other person.

8\. PURCHASES AND AUTOMATICALLY RENEWING SUBSCRIPTIONS
------------------------------------------------------

**_You will have the opportunity to purchase products and services from OkCupid. If you purchase a subscription, it will automatically renew—and you will be charged—until you cancel._**

OkCupid may offer products and services for purchase through iTunes, Google Play or other external services authorized by OkCupid (each, an “External Service,” and any purchases made thereon, an “External Service Purchase”). OkCupid may also offer products and services for purchase via credit card or other payment processors on the Website or inside the App (“Internal Purchases”). If you purchase a subscription, it will automatically renew until you cancel, in accordance with the terms disclosed to you at the time of purchase, as further described below. If you cancel your subscription, you will continue to have access to your subscription benefits until the end of your subscription period, at which point it will expire.

Because our Services may be utilized without a subscription, canceling your subscription does not remove your profile from our Services. If you wish to fully terminate your membership, you must terminate your membership as set forth in Section 9.

### 8a. EXTERNAL SERVICE PURCHASES AND SUBSCRIPTIONS

**_External Service Purchases, including subscriptions, may be processed through the External Service, in which case those purchases must be managed through your External Service Account. Subscriptions automatically renew until you cancel._**

When making a purchase on the Service, you may have the option to pay through an External Service, such as with your Apple ID or Google account (“your External Service Account”), and your External Service Account will be charged for the purchase in accordance with the terms disclosed to you at the time of purchase and the general terms applicable to your External Service Account. Some External Services may charge you sales tax, depending on where you live, which may change from time to time.

If your External Service Purchase includes an automatically renewing subscription, your External Service Account will continue to be periodically charged for the subscription until you cancel. After your initial subscription commitment period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, the subscription will automatically continue for the price and time period you agreed to when subscribing.

**To cancel a subscription**: If you do not want your subscription to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, you must log in to your External Service Account and follow instructions to manage or cancel your subscription, even if you have otherwise deleted your account with us or if you have deleted the App from your device. For example, if you subscribed using your Apple ID, cancellation is handled by Apple, not OkCupid. To cancel a purchase made with your Apple ID, go to Settings > iTunes & App Stores > \[click on your Apple ID\] > View Apple ID > Subscriptions, then find your OkCupid subscription and follow the instructions to cancel. You can also request assistance at [https://getsupport.apple.com](https://getsupport.apple.com/). Similarly, if you subscribed on Google Play, cancellation is handled by Google. To cancel a purchase made through Google Play, launch the Google Play app on your mobile device and go to Menu > My Apps > Subscriptions, then find your OkCupid subscription and follow the instructions to cancel. You can also request assistance at [https://play.google.com](https://play.google.com/). If you cancel a subscription, you may continue to use the cancelled service until the end of your then-current subscription term. The subscription will not be renewed when your then-current term expires.

If you initiate a chargeback or otherwise reverse a payment made with your External Service Account, OkCupid may terminate your account immediately in its sole discretion, on the basis that you have determined that you do not want a OkCupid subscription. In the event that your chargeback or other payment reversal is overturned, please contact [Customer Care](mailto:support@okcupid.com). OkCupid will retain all funds charged to your External Service Account until you cancel your subscription through your External Service Account. Certain users may be entitled to request a refund. See Section 8d below for more information.

### 8b. INTERNAL PURCHASES AND SUBSCRIPTIONS

**_Internal Purchases, including subscriptions, are processed using the Payment Method you provide on the Website or App. Subscriptions automatically renew until you cancel._**

If you make an Internal Purchase, you agree to pay the prices displayed to you for the Services you’ve selected as well as any sales or similar taxes that may be imposed on your payments (and as may change from time to time), and you authorize OkCupid to charge the payment method you provide (your “Payment Method”). OkCupid may correct any billing errors or mistakes even if we have already requested or received payment. If you initiate a chargeback or otherwise reverse a payment made with your Payment Method, OkCupid may terminate your account immediately in its sole discretion, on the basis that you have determined that you do not want a OkCupid subscription. In the event that your chargeback or other payment reversal is overturned, please contact [Customer Care](mailto:support@okcupid.com).

If your Internal Purchase includes an automatically renewing subscription, your Payment Method will continue to be periodically charged for the subscription until you cancel. After your initial subscription commitment period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically continue for the price and time period you agreed to when subscribing, until you cancel.

To cancel a subscription, you can (1) log in to the Website and go to the Settings page, and then click on “Subscriptions”, and follow the instructions to downgrade; or (2) open the Android App and go to the Settings page, then click on Purchases and follow the instructions to downgrade. If you cancel a subscription, you may continue to use the cancelled service until the end of your then-current subscription term. The subscription will not be renewed when your then-current term expires.

You may edit your Payment Method information by using the Settings tool. If a payment is not successfully processed, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated. This may result in a change to your payment billing dates.

In addition, you authorize us to obtain updated or replacement expiration dates and card numbers for your credit or debit card as provided by your credit or debit card issuer. The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer, or other provider of your chosen Payment Method. Certain users may be entitled to request a refund. See Section 8d below for more information.

### 8c. VIRTUAL ITEMS

**_Virtual items are non-refundable and subject to certain conditions._**

From time to time, you may have the opportunity purchase a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to use or access special limited-use features such as “Boost” (“Virtual Item(s)”) from OkCupid. You may only purchase Virtual Items from us or our authorized partners through our Services. Virtual Items represent a limited license right governed by this Agreement, and, except as otherwise prohibited by applicable law, no title or ownership in or to Virtual Items is being transferred or assigned to you. This Agreement should not be construed as a sale of any rights in Virtual Items.

Any Virtual Item balance shown in your account does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of your license. Virtual Items do not incur fees for non-use; however, the license granted to you in Virtual Items will terminate in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, on the earlier of when OkCupid ceases providing our Services, or your account is otherwise closed or terminated.

OkCupid, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to charge fees for the right to access or use Virtual Items and/or may distribute Virtual Items with or without charge. OkCupid may manage, regulate, control, modify, or eliminate Virtual Items at any time, including taking actions that may impact the perceived value or purchase price, if applicable, of any Virtual Items. OkCupid shall have no liability to you or any third party in the event that OkCupid exercises any such rights. The transfer of Virtual Items is prohibited, and you shall not sell, redeem, or otherwise transfer Virtual Items to any person or entity. Virtual Items may only be redeemed through our Services.

ALL PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS OF VIRTUAL ITEMS MADE THROUGH OUR SERVICES ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OKCUPID IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY.

### 8d. REFUNDS

**_Generally, all purchases are nonrefundable. Special terms apply in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, and the EU or European Economic Area._**

Generally, all purchases are final and nonrefundable, and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods, except if the laws applicable in your jurisdiction provide for refunds.

**For subscribers residing in the EU or European Economic Area**:

In accordance with local law, you are entitled to a full refund during the 14 days after the subscription begins. Please note that this 14-day period commences when the subscription starts.

**For subscribers residing in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin**:

**Your Right to Cancel—You may cancel your subscription, without penalty or obligation, at any time prior to midnight of the third business day following the date you subscribed.** In the event that you die before the end of your subscription period, your estate shall be entitled to a refund of that portion of any payment you had made for your subscription which is allocable to the period after your death. In the event that you become disabled (such that you are unable to use our Services) before the end of your subscription period, you shall be entitled to a refund of that portion of any payment you had made for your subscription which is allocable to the period after your disability by providing the company notice in the same manner as you request a refund as described below.

Purchases of Virtual Items are FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE.

If any of the above apply to you and you subscribed using your Apple ID, your refund requests are handled by Apple, not OkCupid. To request a refund, please contact your External Service directly; for example using your Apple device, go to Settings > iTunes & App Stores > \[click on your Apple ID\] > View Apple ID > Purchase History. Find the transaction and select “Report a Problem.” You can also request a refund at [https://getsupport.apple.com](https://getsupport.apple.com/). For any other purchase, please contact OkCupid Customer Service with your order number (see your confirmation email) by mailing or delivering a signed and dated notice which states that you, the buyer, are canceling this agreement, or words of similar effect. Please also include the email address or telephone number associated with your account along with your order number. This notice shall be sent to: OkCupid, Attn: Cancellations, P.O. Box 25472, Dallas, Texas 75225, USA (California and Ohio users may also email us by clicking here or send a facsimile to 214-853-4309).

9\. ACCOUNT TERMINATION
-----------------------

**_If you no longer wish to use our Services, or if we terminate your account for any reason, here’s what you need to know._**

You can delete your account at any time by logging into the Website or App, going to “Settings”, and following the instructions to disable or delete your account. **However, you will need to cancel / manage any External Service Purchases through your External Service Account (e.g., iTunes, Google Play) to avoid additional billing.**

OkCupid reserves the right to investigate and, if appropriate, suspend or terminate your account without a refund if you have violated these Terms, misused our Services, or behaved in a way that OkCupid regards as inappropriate or unlawful, on or off our Services. We reserve the right to make use of any personal, technological, legal, or other means available to enforce the Terms, at any time without liability and without the obligation to give you prior notice, including, but not limited to, preventing you from accessing the Services.

If your account is terminated by you or by OkCupid for any reason, these Terms continue and remain enforceable between you and OkCupid, and you will not be entitled to any refund for purchases made. Your information will be maintained and deleted in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://okcupid.com/legal/privacy).

OkCupid may also provide non-commercial links or references to third parties within its content. OkCupid is not responsible for the availability (or lack of availability) of any external websites or resources or their content.

**_OkCupid’s liability is limited to the maximum extent by applicable law._**

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL OKCUPID, ITS AFFILIATES, EMPLOYEES, LICENSORS, OR SERVICE PROVIDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM: (I) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES, (II) THE CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES ON, THROUGH, OR FOLLOWING USE OF THE SERVICES; OR (III) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR CONTENT, EVEN IF OKCUPID HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 14 SHALL APPLY EVEN IF YOUR REMEDIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FAIL WITH RESPECT TO THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

15\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
-----------------------

**_In the unlikely event that we have a legal dispute, here is what you need to know._**

If you are dissatisfied with our Services for any reason, please contact OkCupid Customer Service first so that we can try to resolve your concerns without the need of outside assistance. If you choose to pursue a claim against OkCupid, these terms will apply.

### 15a. ARBITRATION, CLASS-ACTION WAIVER, AND JURY WAIVER

**_If you pursue a legal claim against OkCupid, you agree to arbitration (with limited exceptions)._**

Except for users residing within the EU or European Economic Area, and where prohibited by law:

1.  The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any alleged breach thereof) or our Services shall be BINDING ARBITRATION administered by JAMS under the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures, except as modified by our [Arbitration Procedures](https://www.okcupid.com/legal/arbitration). The one exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that either party has the right to bring an individual claim against the other in a small-claims court of competent jurisdiction, or, if filed in arbitration, the responding party may request that the dispute proceed in small claims court if the party’s claim is within the jurisdiction of the small claims court. If the responding party requests to proceed in small claims court before the appointment of the arbitrator, the arbitration shall be administratively closed, and if requested after the appointment of the arbitrator, the arbitrator shall determine if the dispute should be decided in arbitration or if the arbitration should be administratively closed and decided in small claims court. Whether you choose arbitration or small-claims court, you may not under any circumstances commence or maintain against the Company any class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding.
    
2.  By using our Services in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration agreement. In doing so, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend any claims between you and the Company (except for matters that may be taken to small-claims court). YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY, and the arbitrator shall determine all issues regarding the arbitrability of the dispute. You are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator. The arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. For details on the arbitration process, see our [Arbitration Procedures](https://www.okcupid.com/legal/arbitration).
    
3.  Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that this arbitration agreement is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against the Company (except for small-claims court actions) may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located in Dallas County, Texas. You hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes.
    
4.  The online dispute settlement platform of the European Commission is available under [http://ec.europa.eu/odr](http://ec.europa.eu/odr). OkCupid does not take part in dispute settlement procedures in front of a consumer arbitration entity for users residing in the EU or European Economic Area.
    

### 15b. GOVERNING LAW

**_Texas law and the Federal Arbitration Act will apply if there is a dispute (except in the EU and where prohibited by law)._**

Except for users residing in the EU or European Economic Area or elsewhere where our arbitration agreement is prohibited by law, the laws of Texas, U.S.A., excluding Texas’s conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement or our Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Arbitration Agreement in Section 15a above shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. For the avoidance of doubt, the choice of Texas governing law shall not supersede any mandatory consumer protection legislation in such jurisdictions.

### 15c. VENUE

**_Any claims that are not submitted to arbitration for any reason must be litigated in Dallas County, Texas (except for claims brought in small claims court, and in the EU or where prohibited by law)._**

Except for users residing in the EU or European Economic Area, who may bring claims in their country of residence in accordance with applicable law, and except for claims that may be properly brought in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction in the county or other jurisdiction in which you reside or in Dallas County, Texas, all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement, to our Services, or to your relationship with OkCupid that for whatever reason are not submitted to arbitration will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Dallas County, Texas, U.S.A. You and OkCupid consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of courts in the State of Texas and waive any claim that such courts constitute an inconvenient forum.

16\. INDEMNITY BY YOU
---------------------

**_You agree to indemnify OkCupid if a claim is made against OkCupid due to your actions._**

You agree, to the extent permitted under applicable law, to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless OkCupid, our affiliates, and their and our respective officers, directors, agents, and employees from and against any and all complaints, demands, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, and expenses, including attorney’s fees, due to, arising out of, or relating in any way to your access to or use of our Services, Your Content, Your conduct toward other users, or your breach of this Agreement.

If any provision of these Terms is held invalid, illegal, or otherwise unenforceable, the remainder of the Terms shall continue in full force and effect. The failure of the Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. You agree that your OkCupid account is non-transferable and all of your rights to your account and its content terminate upon your death, unless otherwise provided by law. Any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by us without restriction.
