Visible values your business and is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy sets forth our policies and practices for the collection, use and sharing of your information. Visible is a member of the Verizon family of companies.

### I. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION

We, and service providers acting on our behalf, collect information when you visit our websites, use our apps, contact us, and when you subscribe to and use our wireless service.

**We collect information you provide directly to us.** This includes personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, postal address, a username and password, payment information, and communications you send to us.

**We collect information when you use our service.** This includes information about the calls you make and receive, text messages you send and receive, when you visit our websites or use our app, and wireless network and device information, including location, Internet protocol (IP) address and connection speed, mobile telephone number, device and advertising identifiers, browser type, and operating system. Some Visible devices include Verizon-provided system applications that collect information about network and device conditions, which is used to secure and improve our network and services.

**We also collect information when you visit our sites and use our apps, including through cookies and similar technology.** This includes your IP address, mobile number, device and advertising identifiers; browser and platform type, operating system, connection speed and other attributes; pages that you visit before and after visiting our sites; the date and time of your visit; information about the links you click and pages you view within the sites and screen records.

We, and service providers acting on our behalf, automatically collect information about your use of our sites or apps using cookies, pixels, web beacons, scripts, and other similar technologies. We use this information to analyze visitor activity on our site to understand website traffic patterns and engagement, administer our sites, measure advertising effectiveness, to gather demographic information about our customer base as a whole, and for other business purposes.

We and our partners also use these tools to collect and store information about our users. You can control the use of cookies using browser controls, but if you choose to disable cookies, you may limit your use of certain features or functions on our websites or services.

We also allow advertising companies to collect information about your activity on our websites and in our app, for example through cookies, mobile ad identifiers, pixels, web beacons and social network plugins, to help us provide more relevant Visible advertisements on our website and on others’ sites and apps. These ads may be tailored for you based on your activity on Visible sites and combined with your activities on other websites and in apps where these advertising companies are present. These advertising companies may also use information they collect for others’ advertising purposes. The use of information collected about your visits over time and across different websites, apps and devices is known as “cross-contextual interest-based advertising.”

Visible websites may also include social network or other third-party plug-ins, widgets, or other similar technology that may provide information to associated social networks or third parties even if you do not click on or otherwise interact with the plug-ins and widgets.

**We collect info when you contact us.** When you contact us or we contact you, we may monitor or record that communication for quality assurance, training and security purposes.

**We collect information about you from others.** We may obtain information about you from other sources, including from companies that collect consumer information such as demographic and interest data. In addition, if you access third-party services, such as Facebook, Google, or Twitter, from our sites or apps, to log into our sites or apps, or to share information about your experience, we may collect information from these third-party services.

### IV. INFORMATION SECURITY AND RETENTION

We use reasonable measures to help protect information from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. You should understand that no data storage system or transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure.

Our policies require that we retain records for as long they are needed to provide you service or for legal, tax, audit, investigative, and/or security purposes and then securely delete or destroy them.
