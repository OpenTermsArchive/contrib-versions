--------------------------------

Visible values your business and is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy sets forth our policies and practices for the collection, use and sharing of your information. Visible is a member of the Verizon family of companies.

### I. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION

We collect information when you visit our websites, use our apps, contact us, and when you subscribe to and use our wireless service.

**We collect information you provide directly to us.** This includes personal information (such as your name, email address, phone number, postal address, Social Security number, and date of birth), a username and password, payment information, and communications you send to us.

**We collect information when you use our service.** This includes information about the calls you make and receive, text messages you send and receive, websites you visit, mobile applications you use, and wireless network and device information, including location, Internet protocol (IP) address and connection speed, mobile telephone number, device and advertising identifiers, browser type, and operating system. Some Visible devices include Verizon-provided system applications that collect information about network and device conditions, which is used to secure and improve our network and services.

**We also collect information when you visit our sites and use our apps, including through cookies and similar technology.** This includes your IP address, mobile number, device and advertising identifiers; browser and platform type, operating system, connection speed and other attributes; pages that you visit before and after visiting our sites; the date and time of your visit; information about the links you click and pages you view within the sites and screen records.

We may use cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies to automatically collect this information. Cookies are small bits of information that are stored by your computer’s web browser. Pixel tags are very small images or small pieces of data embedded in images, also known as “web beacons” or “clear GIFs,” that can recognize cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, a description of the page where the pixel tag is placed, and similar information from your computer or device. By using our websites and applications, you consent to our use of cookies and similar technologies.

We also allow advertising companies to collect information about your activity on our websites and in our app, for example through cookies, mobile ad identifiers, pixels, web beacons and social network plugins, to help us provide more relevant Visible advertisements on our website and on others’ sites and apps. The use of information collected about your visits over time and across different websites, apps and devices is known as “interest-based advertising.” Please see Section V below for more information with regard to the use of your information for these purposes.

**We collect info when you contact us.** When you contact us or we contact you, we may monitor or record that communication for quality assurance, training and security purposes.

**We collect information about you from others.** We may obtain information about you from other sources, including from companies that collect consumer information such as demographic and interest data. In addition, if you access third-party services, such as Facebook, Google, or Twitter, from our sites or apps, to log into our sites or apps, or to share information about your experience, we may collect information from these third-party services.

### II. USE OF INFORMATION

We use the information we collect to deliver service, to market to you, and for other business purposes, including to:

*   Fulfill your requests for products, services, information and customer support;
*   Determine products and services that may interest you and market them to you, including on Visible sites and apps and on others’ sites, services, apps and devices as described in Section V below;

*   For any other purposes disclosed to you at the time we collect your information or with your consent.

### III. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION

We share information about you with vendors and partners who do work on our behalf and for other business purposes. We may also share certain information about you with affiliates for marketing.

*   **Authorized service providers and partners.** We share your information with service providers and partners that help us with a variety of things, including development and delivery of our sites, apps and service. This includes services provided by others to help us with analytics, including [Google Analytics](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites), which may include storing and accessing cookies and other information on your computer or wireless device.
*   **Business transfers.** We may share your information in connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as a merger, consolidation, asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.
*   **Legal purposes.** We may disclose information (1) to respond to subpoenas, court orders, legal process, law enforcement requests, legal claims or government inquiries and in emergencies such as those involving the danger of death or serious injury to any person; (2) to advance, protect or defend the rights, interests, property, safety, and security of Visible, our affiliates, users, or the public; (3) to identify, protect against, and address unauthorized or unlawful use of our sites, apps or service, or our network; and (4) to outside auditors and regulators.
*   **Collections.** We may disclose information to collection agencies to obtain payment for Visible-billed products and services.

*   **With your consent.** We may share information for any other purposes disclosed to you at the time we collect the information or pursuant to your consent.

If you access third-party services, such as Facebook, Google, or Twitter, through our sites or apps, to log in or to share information about your experience with others, these third-party services may be able to collect information about you and they may notify your connections on the third-party services about your use of the site or app, in accordance with their own privacy policies.

### IV. SECURITY

We use reasonable measures to help protect information from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. You should understand that no data storage system or transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure.

### V. COOKIES, SOCIAL MEDIA PLUGINS AND OTHER WEBSITE AND APP TOOLS

You may see Visible ads on others’ sites, services, apps and devices, as well as on Visible sites and apps. These ads may be tailored for you based on information that we or companies acting on our behalf collect on Visible sites and apps as well as other sites and apps where these advertising entities also are present.

To accomplish this type of advertising, advertising entities place and access cookies and similar technologies on browsers you use and access advertising identifiers from your mobile device operating systems. Information about your activities on the websites and in the apps where the entities are present can be combined and used to determine whether you fall into an audience advertisers wish to reach.

Advertising that is customized based on information about your visits over time and across different websites, apps and devices is known as “interest-based” advertising. In accordance with the [Digital Advertising Alliance](https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/) self-regulatory principles, we require that advertising companies disclose when they are using interest-based advertising techniques to deliver interest-based ads on our sites and apps as well as when they deliver Visible ads on other sites. We also require them to offer you an ability to [opt out](https://optout.aboutads.info/) of this use of your information. You can visit the industry-wide [Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out page](https://optout.aboutads.info/) to learn more and opt out. Additionally, you will see an icon ![](/images/add-choices.jpg?t=0024bf63581498e264df4a3278f6a82c) in or around online advertisements placed using interest-based advertising techniques. You can click on the icon to learn more and opt out. You can also opt out of the use of your device identifiers for interest-based advertising by selecting “Limit Ad Tracking” or “Opt out of Interest-Based Ads” in your device Settings.

Visible websites may include social network or other third-party plug-ins and widgets that may provide information to their associated social networks or third parties even if you do not click on or otherwise interact with the plug-ins and widgets.

### VI. YOUR CHOICES

You have choices about certain ways we use and share information about you.

**Marketing.** You have choices about receiving marketing from Visible. If you would like to be removed from Visible’s email marketing list, you can opt-out by following the unsubscribe instructions, usually found at the bottom of the emails.

**Website information used for interest based advertising** You have a choice about whether certain information collected on websites, including Visible sites, is used to customize advertisements you see on the internet. Click on this icon ![](/images/add-choices.jpg?t=0024bf63581498e264df4a3278f6a82c) in or around an advertisement and follow the instructions for opting out. Similarly, settings on your mobile devices let you limit the collection and use of information from your device for advertising purposes. You can also set up cookie controls through many browser settings. Because each web browser is different, please consult the instructions provided by your web browser (typically in the “help” section). If you choose to refuse, disable, or delete these technologies, some of the functionality of our apps or sites may no longer be available to you.

**Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms.** Some web browsers transmit "do-not-track" signals to websites. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. We currently do not take action in response to these signals.

### VII. INTERNATIONAL USERS

Our sites, apps and service are designed for and targeted to U.S. audiences and are governed by and operated in accordance with the laws of the U.S. We make no representation that our apps, sites or service are operated in accordance with the laws or regulations of any other nation. By using our apps, sites or service and providing us with information, you understand and agree that your information may be transferred to and stored on servers located outside your resident jurisdiction and, to the extent you are a resident of a country other than the United States, that you consent to the transfer of such data to the United States for processing by us in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### VIII. CHANGES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY
