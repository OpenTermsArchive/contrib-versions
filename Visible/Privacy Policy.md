In addition, if you access third-party services, such as Facebook, Google, or Twitter, from our sites or apps, to log into our sites or apps, or to share information about your experience, we may collect information from these third-party services.

### IV. INFORMATION SECURITY AND RETENTION

We use reasonable measures to help protect information from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. You should understand that no data storage system or transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure.

Our policies require that we retain records for as long they are needed to provide you service or for legal, tax, audit, investigative, and/or security purposes and then securely delete or destroy them.

### V. COOKIES, SOCIAL MEDIA PLUGINS AND OTHER WEBSITE AND APP TOOLS

You may see Visible ads on others’ sites, services, apps and devices, as well as on Visible sites and apps. These ads may be tailored for you based on information that we or companies acting on our behalf collect on Visible sites and apps as well as other sites and apps where these advertising entities also are present.

To accomplish this type of advertising, advertising entities place and access cookies and similar technologies on browsers you use and access advertising identifiers from your mobile device operating systems. Information about your activities on the websites and in the apps where the entities are present can be combined and used to determine whether you fall into an audience advertisers wish to reach.

Visible websites may also include social network or other third-party plug-ins, widgets, or other similar technology that may provide information to associated social networks or third parties even if you do not click on or otherwise interact with the plug-ins and widgets. Visible and our service providers may also analyze visitor activity on our site to understand website traffic patterns and engagement, measure advertising effectiveness, and for other business purposes.
