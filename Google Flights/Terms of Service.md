Google Flight Search Booking
----------------------------

Welcome to Google Flight Search!

The use of booking on Google Flight Search is subject to these terms, in addition to Google's [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms). If you’re based in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, Google Flight Search is provided by Google Ireland Limited (“**Google**”), a company incorporated and operating under the laws of Ireland (Registered Number: 368047), and located at Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. If you're based in any other country or region, Google Flight Search is made available to you by Google LLC located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States, and with tax number 372000041 (“**Google**”).

### Booking through Google Flight Search

On Google’s Flight Search website, you can make a booking request for some airlines’ flights. By completing the required fields of the booking request screen on Google Flight Search, and submitting the booking request by clicking on the "Book" button, you will make a binding booking request to the respective airline or online travel agent and enter into an agreement with and authorize Google to pass your booking request information through to the airline and/or the online travel agent identified on the booking request screen.

Google acts as an intermediary only, and we cannot control whether your booking request is accepted by the airline and/or the online travel agent.

Prior to completing and submitting your booking request, you should carefully check all of the information that you have entered. You will be given an opportunity to review and correct the information that you have entered prior to completing and submitting sending your booking request.

All tickets issued by airlines for bookings made through Google Flight Search are electronic tickets (e-tickets). All bookings are stored in the global distribution system of the airline and/or online travel agent, and the airline and/or online travel agent will send you the corresponding reference and e-ticket number directly along with the booking confirmation email.

Google’s contractual obligation is limited to passing your booking request through to the respective airline and/or online travel agent, and we will not provide any other booking-related services. Specifically, Google is under no obligation to provide the transportation service in question. Google is not a party to the contract between you and the airline and/or online travel agent that you book with through Google Flight Search.

### Information about you

Google's [privacy policies](https://policies.google.com/privacy) explain how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when using Google Flight Search. Google will need to provide your personal information, such as your traveller and payment details, to airlines and/or online travel agents for the purposes of processing your flight booking. Airlines and/or online travel agents will use this information in accordance with their privacy policies.

### Airline’s Terms and Conditions

Any flight that you book through Google Flight Search is governed by the terms and conditions of the airline that you book your flight with, including its conditions of carriage and any other terms that you may view in the course of the booking process using the hyperlinks on Google Flight Search (“**Airline Terms and Conditions**”). Google is not responsible for the content of the Airline’s Terms and Conditions. The Airline's Terms and Conditions may contain provisions on passengers’ transportation and baggage (including dangerous goods), cancellations, rebooking or refunds, payment, delays, annulments and denied boarding, liability, as well as additional booking and fare rules. It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself and comply with the Airline's Terms and Conditions. Additionally, online travel agents may impose their own terms and conditions – such as additional fees for change/refund requests – that supplement the Airline's Terms and Conditions.

### Flight documents

The respective airlines’ rules regarding the documents that you must show to prove your right of carriage may vary and can be found in the Airline's Terms and Conditions. It is your responsibility to be in possession of all necessary and valid travel documents for your journey, as well as any necessary identification documentation.

### Cancellations and changes

Cancellations and changes to any flights that you book through Google Flight Search are subject to the Airline's Terms and Conditions. Many airlines reserve the right to make schedule changes and cancel confirmed bookings, and supplemental terms and conditions of online travel agents may also apply. Google is not responsible for such schedule changes or cancellations, and we do not have any control over them. Please contact the airline or online travel agent if you have any questions or would like to cancel or make changes to your booking.

### Carriage and check-in

Please note that the Airline's Terms and Conditions contain specific terms of carriage, such as check-in closing times, which must be observed, failing which the airline may refuse carriage.

### Baggage

Please also observe the provisions on the carriage of baggage contained in the Airline's Terms and Conditions, as airlines may impose extra fees for carry-on, checked, oversized or excess baggage that is not included in the payment of the total price of the booking made through Google Flight Search.

### Means of payment

As part of the booking process, you will be asked to pay using your Google Payments Account. If you do not have a Google Payments Account, you can pay using a credit or debit card. You must agree to the payment terms as specified in the Google Payments [Terms of Service](https://payments.google.com/termsOfService?type%3DBuyer%26gl%3DCA). If you do not have a Google Payments Account, you can set one up by going to this [link](https://payments.google.com/), where you can also find more information about Google Payments. The Google Payments Terms of Service apply whenever you want to pay for a booking. Please ensure that you read those terms carefully before making any purchase. The Google Payments [Privacy Notice](https://payments.google.com/files/privacy.html) explains how your personal data is treated and your privacy protected when you pay for a booking

### Add-on Fees

Airlines may charge for additional services such as airport check-in, preferred seating, in-flight entertainment (if available), food, drink and snacks, etc. Any charges for these additional services are not included in the price of your flight ticket as displayed on Google Flight Search unless explicitly provided otherwise, and must be arranged with and paid to the airline directly.
