*   Specific pieces of information collected about you.

The CCPA also requires that if you request access to your information, we provide you with responsive materials in a readily usable format that allows you to transmit your information from one entity to another without hindrance.

**Deletion of Your Personal Information**

The CCPA generally permits you to request that we and our direct service providers delete your personal information. However, we are not required to delete your personal information for any of the following reasons:

*   if we need your information to complete the transaction for which it was collected;
*   to comply with a legal obligation;
*   to comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 seq.), as amended;
*   to detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities;
*   to identify and repair errors that impair existing and intended functionality; or
*   to make other internal and lawful uses of your information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.

Once we receive and confirm your request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your information from our records, unless an exception applies.

**Opt Out of the Sale of Your Information**

Under the CCPA, you may opt out of the sale of your personal information to third parties. To help you exercise this right, a Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) “CA Do Not Sell My Info” link is available on our homepage. Clicking on the link will [allow you to opt out](https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/press-release/digital-advertising-alliance-announces-ccpa-tools-ad-industry) of the sale of your personal information, including its use for interest-based advertising, across all companies participating in the DAA’s mechanism.

**Nondiscrimination**

We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless allowed by the CCPA, we will not:

*   Deny you services;
*   Charge you different prices or rates for services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties;
*   Provide you a different level or quality of services; or
*   Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for services or a different level or quality of services.

#### Who May Exercise Your CCPA Rights

Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.

#### Verifying Consumer Requests

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. 

A verifiable consumer request must: (i) provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are in fact the California resident about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative; and (ii) describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request. 

#### Response Timing, Format, and Fees

We will respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt or as permitted by law. If we require more time (up to ninety (90) days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing (including email). 

Any disclosures we provide will only cover the twelve (12)-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. 

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive or manifestly unfounded. If we reasonably determine that the request requires a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and give you a cost estimate in writing before completing your request.

#### How to Submit Requests

Submit your requests to the information listed in Section 7 (Contact Information) above. 

#### Shine The Light Law

Separate from the CCPA, California Civil Code Section 1798.83, as amended, also known as the “Shine The Light” law gives California residents the right to request and obtain what personal information we share with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes. We do not disclose your personal information to third parties for such third parties to directly market their services to you. If you have any questions about our Shine The Light Law practices, please contact us as outlined in Section 7 (Contact Information) above.

#### Do Not Track

California law requires us to tell you know how we respond to web browser Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals. DNT allows users a way to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers.

#### NEVADA RESIDENT PRIVACY RIGHTS

[Nevada law (SB 220)](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/80th2019/Bill/6365/Text), as amended, requires website operators to give Nevada residents a way to opt out of the sale of certain information that a website operator may collect about them. We do not sell your personal information to third parties as defined Nevada law, and will not do so in the future without giving you notice and an opportunity to opt-out of such sale as required by law. If you have any questions regarding our compliance with Nevada data privacy law, please contact us listed above in Section 7 (Contact Information).

#### EUROPEAN RESIDENT PRIVACY RIGHTS

This section applies to European Residents only. A “European Resident” is a resident of a country in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or Switzerland. 

European Union (“EU”) data protection rules, also known as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), describe different situations when a company like ours is allowed to collect or reuse your personal information. 

Our legal basis for collecting and using your information depends on the specific information concerned and the context in which we collect it. We collect your personal information only with your consent or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. We may also have legal obligations to collect your information or may otherwise need your information to protect your vital interests or those of another person. If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement, we will notify you of the legal requirement and the information we require. If we collect and use your information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), our legitimate interest will usually involve operating and improving this Site, communicating with you, marketing purposes, or detecting or preventing fraud. For more information about GDPR, please visit the [EU’s “Data protection and online privacy” page](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/consumers/internet-telecoms/data-protection-online-privacy/index_en.htm). If you have any questions about our compliance with GDPR, please contact us as outlined above in Section 7 (Contact Information).

#### INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS

If you reside in the European Union, your personal information may be processed outside of EEA.  We take all necessary steps to ensure that your information is adequately protected and processed in accordance with this Policy, using the [European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/eu-us-data-transfers_en) – European Commission-approved contracts that offer personal information the same protection as under European law.
