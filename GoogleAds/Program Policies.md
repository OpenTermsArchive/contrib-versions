Google Ads policies
===================

Welcome to the Google Advertising Policies Center.

We want to support a healthy digital advertising ecosystemâ€”one that is trustworthy and transparent, and works for users, advertisers, and publishers. The purpose of this website is to help you build Google Ads campaigns that align with our advertising policies listed below. These policies are designed not only to abide by laws but to ensure a safe and positive experience for our users. This means that our policies prohibit some content that we believe to be harmful to users and the overall advertising ecosystem.

We use a combination of automated and human evaluation to ensure Google Ads comply with these policies. However, if you observe any ads that may violate our policies, please report those ads [here](https://support.google.com/google-ads/contact/vio_other_aw_policy).

Our advertising policies cover four broad areas:

Restricted content and features
-------------------------------

The policies below cover content that is sometimes legally or culturally sensitive. Online advertising can be a powerful way to reach customers, but in sensitive areas, we also work hard to avoid showing these ads when and where they might be inappropriate.

For that reason, we allow the promotion of the content below, but on a limited basis. These promotions may not show to every user in every location, and advertisers may need to meet additional requirements before their ads are eligible to run. Note that not all ad products, features, or networks are able to support this restricted content. Further details can be found in the Policy Center.

### [Adult content](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6023699)

> Ads should respect user preferences and comply with legal regulations, so we donâ€™t allow certain kinds of adult content in ads and destinations. Some kinds of adult-oriented ads and destinations are allowed if they comply with the policies below and donâ€™t target minors, but they will only show in limited scenarios based on user search queries, user age, and local laws where the ad is being served.

About our policies
------------------

Google Ads enables businesses of all sizes, from around the world, to promote a wide variety of products, services, applications, and websites on Google and across our network. We want to help you reach existing and potential customers and audiences. However, to help create a safe and positive experience for users, we listen to their feedback and concerns about the types of ads they see. We also regularly review changes in online trends and practices, industry norms, and regulations. And finally, in crafting our policies, we also think about our values and culture as a company, as well as operational, technical, and business considerations. As a result, we have created a set of policies that apply to all promotions on the Google Network.

Google requires that advertisers comply with all [applicable laws and regulations](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6023676) and the Google policies described above. It's important that you familiarize yourself with and keep up to date on these requirements for the places where your business operates, as well as any other places your ads are showing. When we find content that violates these requirements, we may block it from appearing, and in cases of repeated or egregious violations, we may stop you from advertising with us.
