### **A.** **INTRODUCTION**

This Privacy Notice (the “**Privacy Notice**”) explains how we and third parties obtain certain information about you when you use or interact with a U.S. website, mobile or other digital app, print subscription, digital subscription product, or other digital service (each a “**Hearst Service**”). The Hearst Services are provided by the Hearst affiliated network of media companies, including Television stations, Newspapers, and Magazines (collectively “**Hearst**,” “**we**,” “**our**,” or “**us**”). You can learn more about the brands and businesses that make up the Hearst affiliated network of media companies [here](https://hearst.com/affiliated-media-companies).  

This Privacy Notice describes the privacy practices of the Hearst affiliated network of media companies and does not cover the practices of other companies, including those that may advertise or sponsor content, products or services on the Hearst Services.

Depending on the specific Hearst Service you interact with, our practices with respect to personal information may vary; certain Hearst Services may have additional notices, which should be read in conjunction with this Privacy Notice. Please note that some of the media companies within the Hearst affiliated network provide other offerings that are subject to different privacy notices. This Privacy Notice does not apply to Hearst offerings that have a different privacy notice. 

Applicable privacy laws contain certain exemptions that apply when personal information is processed for journalistic purposes. As a publisher, Hearst processes personal information for such journalistic purposes, including to develop and publish our content. Because of these exemptions, privacy laws do not apply to some of the ways in which Hearst processes personal information. This Privacy Notice does not cover personal information processed in the context of our journalistic activities. 

### **B.** **WHAT INFORMATION WE OBTAIN**

When you use a Hearst Service, we may obtain various types of information related to you and your use of the Hearst Service. This may include information that directly identifies you such as your name, address, or contact information (this type of information may be called “**personal information**,” “**personal data**,” or “**personally identifiable information**”). We, our service providers, and third parties may aggregate or anonymize information that we collect in connection with your use of the Hearst Services; this information is not “personal information,” “personal data,” or “personally identifiable information.” Certain pieces of information we obtain (for example, account login, payment card information, race, precise geolocation, or ethnicity) may be considered “**sensitive**” under privacy laws. The information we obtain generally consists of information (1) you give us about yourself, (2) you give us about others, (3) automatically collected about your interactions with the Hearst Services and our content or ads on third-party websites, apps or other media, and (4) we get from other sources.

#### **1.** **Information you give us**

We may ask you to provide information about yourself when you use the Hearst Services. For example, to sign up for one of our newsletters or news alerts, you will need to give us an email address. You may not be able to use certain features if you choose not to submit the requested information.

The information you give us may include details such as:

*   Contact information (e.g., name, mailing address, email address or phone number).
*   Demographic, interests and household information (e.g., age, gender or education).
*   Payment information for subscriptions or purchases made through the Hearst Services (e.g., payment card number, expiration date and billing information).

Please note that we may transcribe and retain your inquiries and responses when you interact with AI chatbots that are part of the Hearst Services, which may be shared with others and used for training AI models. Please do not provide information in a chat session with these features that you do not want retained and used for these purposes.
*   Information you provide when you choose to participate in surveys, polls, sweepstakes, contests or promotions (including information about your participation in activities that may generate loyalty or rewards points).
*   Location information, which may include precise location information when you permit the Hearst Services to access device location. To prevent the collection of precise location information, please refer to instructions provided by your mobile service provider or device manufacturer.
*   Other information you may allow us to access through your device’s permissions settings, such as your contacts or address book.
*   Transactional and activity information (e.g., requests, searches or orders).

#### **2\. Information you give us about others**

You may give us information about other people, such as the name and email of a friend or contact with whom you want to share an article, the name and address of a gift subscription recipient, or if you participate in a survey or research initiative. Do not give us information about others unless you are authorized or have their consent to do so. We will use their information for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice.

#### **3.** **Information automatically collected**

The Hearst Services automatically log certain information about visits to the Hearst Services, such as the number and frequency of visitors, technical information about browsers and devices used to access the Hearst Services, and information about crashes or other technical issues. We and our service providers may collect data from your browser or device (including connected apps and devices) for analytics and measurement purposes. In addition, we and third parties may automatically collect certain information through automated means about your activities over time across the Hearst Services as well as across third-party websites, apps or other media. The tools that collect this information vary depending on the Hearst Services and include technologies such as cookies, web beacons, tags, scripts, pixels, and software development kits (“SDKs”). These technologies may be included in our web pages, mobile or other digital apps, emails, and other digital content. The tools may assign or collect unique cookie IDs or other identifiers associated with your browser or device. The tools may collect information while you are using our Hearst Services or while they are running in the background of your device.

The information automatically collected may include:

*   Information about your computer, device, browser and operating system (e.g., type, model, or version).
*   Internet protocol (IP) address, which may be used to derive your general geographic area (e.g., city and country).
*   Device identifiers (e.g., mobile advertising IDs) or unique identifiers (e.g., based on hashed contact information).
*   Information about your interactions with the Hearst Services, including browsing and search activities and clickstream data that reflect the content (including advertising) and website features you have accessed, clicked on, viewed, watched, or otherwise interacted with.
*   Information about how you accessed the Hearst Services, including details about websites or apps visited immediately before or after accessing a Hearst Service.
*   Demographic, interests and household information.
*   Information about your interactions with email messages and other communications, such as whether you opened or forwarded the email or clicked on links contained in or attachments to the email.

#### **4.** **Information we obtain from other sources**

We receive information about you from other sources and it may be combined with other information about you. For example, we may obtain data from:

*   Operators of third-party websites or apps, content distribution channels and platforms (e.g., Roku, Amazon Fire TV), voice-activated assistants (e.g., Amazon Alexa, Google Home) or other devices and technologies when you interact with our content, products, services or ads available on those channels and platforms. The information we receive may include information about the content you view or access as well as your demographic information and information about your interests.
*   Third-party data suppliers such as data aggregators, data resellers, identity resolution providers, public databases and business partners. Some of these third-party data suppliers may be considered “data brokers” under applicable laws. They may provide us with demographic information, identifiers, hashed emails, information about your purchases, and other information that helps us learn about you and other users of the Hearst Services. 
*   Authentication service partners. Certain Hearst Services allow you to log in through third-party authentication services, such as Facebook, Google, Apple, or Microsoft. When you use one of these partners to log in to the Hearst Services, they share certain information with us including name and email address. 
*   Social Media Platforms and similar services (“Social Media Platforms”). When you engage with our content or ads on Social Media Platforms, or interact with features on the Hearst Services that contain content or features provided by Social Media Platforms (e.g., login or sign in features or tools that allow you to share our content with others on Social Media Platforms), we may obtain information from Social Media Platforms, including your username, user ID, demographic information and other information, subject to the settings and privacy practices of the relevant Social Media Platform. We may obtain this information directly from the Social Media Platform or through plug-ins, integrations or applications. Please keep in mind that the operators of the Social Media Platforms may also gather information about your use of the Hearst Services and their features and tools.
*   Business partners, including advertisers, joint marketing partners, co-sponsors, and others. 

### **C. HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE OBTAIN**

If you make a purchase or place an order through or in connection with a Hearst Service (including for paid content), we use your payment card information (e.g., your card number and expiration date) for limited purposes such as to process your transaction (including recurring payments, if applicable), to provide you with the requested products or services and for the purposes described under the section “To protect our rights or the rights of others” below.

With respect to information other than your payment card information, we use that information:

**1\. To provide you with the Hearst Services**. This includes:

*   Processing your requests regarding the Hearst Services and our subscriptions, products or services, or your participation in a survey, sweepstakes, contest, promotion, event or similar initiative.
*   Providing customer assistance or technical support. 
*   Personalizing content, features, and ads, and enhancing the quality and your overall experience with the Hearst Services. We may retain user preferences to personalize your experience with the Hearst Services and content recommendations based on your reading habits, preferences, interests, and location, including to highlight content you may be interested in and de-emphasize content you may have already read. 
*   Presenting content and features in the most effective manner for the browser or device you use to access the Hearst Services.
*   Maintaining, operating, improving and developing the Hearst Services and related content, features, products or services, including developing new products and features based on users’ interactions with the Hearst Services.
*   Learning about users of the Hearst Services and analyzing how you and others interact with and respond to the Hearst Services, including by measuring and optimizing usage, reliability and performance, conducting market research, analyzing trends, and supporting our operations (e.g., for accounting, auditing, financial, legal or other purposes).
*   Authenticating the account(s) being used to log in to the Hearst Services. 

We may leverage AI, machine learning and algorithmic tools in connection with any of the above to provide you with the Hearst Services.

**2\. To communicate with you**. This includes:

*   Sending you informational messages about the Hearst Services (e.g., to confirm your subscription or notify you of changes to a Hearst Service).
*   Delivering marketing or promotional communications, including offers or promotions about our or third parties’ products, services or other initiatives.
*   Responding to your questions or addressing your requests.
*   Communicating with you about surveys, sweepstakes, contests, promotions or events.

**3\. For advertising and marketing purposes, including targeted advertising.** This includes:

*   Developing, personalizing, managing and conducting advertising and marketing campaigns, promotions and offers, including about our content, products and services or third parties’ products, services and other initiatives, whether on the Hearst Services or elsewhere. 
*   Targeted advertising (also known as online behavioral advertising) is advertising based on your interests in topics and content based on your activities over time on the Hearst Services and online services operated by third parties, as well as information from other sources, including information collected offline or sourced from third-party data suppliers, as further described in section B.4 Information we obtain from other sources. Targeted ads may consist of text ads, images, animations or videos and may be displayed to you based on various factors, including the context of the website or app in which they appear (e.g., sport or travel section), information you provided to the operator of the website or app (e.g., when you created an account), your activities on the website or app (e.g., pages viewed, searches performed or ads clicked), and information such as your demographic, interests and household information.
    *    On the Hearst Services and on third-party websites, apps or other media, we, our service providers and third parties may use automated means to (a) collect information for targeted advertising purposes or (b) serve you targeted ads. These automated means vary depending on the Hearst Services and include technologies such as cookies, web beacons, tags, scripts, pixels, and SDKs. These technologies may use unique identifiers associated with your browser or device to support targeted advertising.  
        We may use and/or combine online and offline information we obtain about you, including your personal information, for targeted advertising purposes and other advertising and marketing initiatives. This may include, as applicable: 
        *   Targeting ads by using identity resolution partners that enable targeted advertising by matching or augmenting information we collect about you. 
        *   Hashing information, including your personal information (such as an email address), and disclosing it. 
        *   Aggregating the information we obtain to create audiences that are most likely to respond to ads based on demographic, interests or household information. 
    *   Targeted ads may be displayed to you by third parties, such as ad networks or exchanges.
    *   There are steps you can take to limit the collection of your information for targeted advertising purposes. These steps vary for the web and mobile app environments and are browser and device specific. To learn more about targeted advertising and opt-out choices, see [https://youradchoices.com/control](https://youradchoices.com/control) and in the section DAA Industry Opt-Out. In addition, for connected devices such as smart TVs or streaming devices, please review the device’s settings and select the option that allows you to disable automatic content recognition or ad tracking.
    *   In serving targeted ads, we adhere to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising developed by the Digital Advertising Alliance.
*   Cross-device linking. If you access the Hearst Services from multiple browsers or devices, we, our service providers, identity resolution partners, data suppliers, and third parties may try to establish connections among and link the different browsers and devices you use to access the Hearst Services and our content or ads published elsewhere. This helps us provide you with a seamless experience across the browsers and devices you use and serve you with more relevant content and ads on the Hearst Services or elsewhere (e.g., so that we don’t show you the same article twice or to show you personalized or preferred content and ads on the different devices you may use). See [section Website (Browser) Opt-Outs](https://www.hearst.com/-/us-magazines-privacy-notice#_BROWSER_OPT_OUT) for steps you can take to limit browser and mobile app tracking for targeted advertising purposes.
*   Analyzing and measuring the performance, effectiveness and reach of our advertising (including targeted ads) and marketing efforts on the Hearst Services and elsewhere. 

**4\. To protect our rights or the rights of others**. This includes:

*   Detecting, preventing and responding to fraud or potentially illegal activities, misuse of the Hearst Services, intellectual property infringement or other violations of law, this Privacy Notice, the applicable Hearst Service’s Terms of Use or other Hearst policies.
*   Maintaining, monitoring and enhancing the overall brand safety and information security and integrity of the Hearst Services
*   Performing audits, assessments and testing or troubleshooting activities.
*   Backing up our systems (including for disaster recovery purposes) 
*   Complying with and enforcing applicable industry and legal requirements (including legal process such as court orders, warrants or subpoenas) and fulfilling contractual obligations.

We limit the use of this information to what is reasonably necessary to provide the Hearst Services to you and for purposes permitted by applicable law (e.g., to ensure security and integrity). If you refuse to provide such information, it may affect the delivery of the Hearst Services or make us unable to provide services to you. In addition, if you have participated in journalistic or editorial surveys, polls, or similar initiatives in connection with the Hearst Services, you may have chosen to provide us with some “sensitive” information as part of your input (e.g., race or ethnic origin). Note that certain jurisdictions may provide individuals with the right to opt-in, opt-out, or limit the use and disclosure of “sensitive” personal information; however, personal information that we process to provide you with the requested Hearst Services or for journalistic purposes are not subject to this limitation/consent revocation right.

#### **Additional Opt-Out Methods**

In addition to the rights afforded throughout this Privacy Notice and through the privacy rights form available at [accessprivacy.hearstmags.com](mailto:accessprivacy.hearstmags.com), and the “Your Privacy Choices (Opt Out of Sale/Targeted Ads)” button in the footer of the Hearst website you have interacted with, there are industry frameworks and settings made available to you by device manufacturers that enable you to adjust your preferences with respect to the data collected about you and the ads that you may see. The section below provides more information about these settings.

**DAA Industry** **Opt-Out**

Some of the ads you see on the Hearst Services are targeted ads (this is also known as online behavioral advertising) described in section [C. 3 For advertising and marketing purposes, including targeted advertising](https://www.hearst.com/-/us-magazines-privacy-notice#_INTEREST_BASED). We describe below steps you can take to limit tracking of your activities and the delivery of targeted ads in browsers and mobile or other digital apps you use to access the Hearst Services. Please keep in mind that if you opt out of targeted ads, you will still see ads, but these ads will not be based on your inferred interests. In addition, if you take the steps described below, some automated means may still be used to collect information about your interactions with the Hearst Services for the other purposes described in this Privacy Notice (e.g., to remember user preferences or enable specific functionality).

The technologies used to deliver ads on websites and mobile or other digital apps differ. Please also remember that opt- outs are browser and device-specific.

**Website (Browser) Opt-Out**

1.  **Disabling Cookies.** Most browsers accept cookies by default. You may be able to change the settings to have your browser refuse certain cookies or notify you before accepting cookies.

**Mobile App Opt-Out**

1.  **Device Settings.** To limit targeted advertising on your mobile device, you can review and adjust the settings provided by your device manufacturer, such as [guidance published for iOS](https://support.apple.com/en-lamr/HT202074) or [guidance published for Android](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads?hl=en).

Please keep in mind that as the mobile environment continues to evolve, additional opt-out mechanisms or privacy settings may become available to you. We encourage you to review the information on opt-outs and settings that device manufacturers, technology companies and industry associations make available to you.

**Smart TVs, Streaming & Other Connected Devices**

For connected devices, such as smart TVs or streaming devices, please review the device’s settings and select the option that allows you to disable automatic content recognition or ad tracking. Typically, to opt out, such devices require you to select options like “limit ad tracking” or to disable options such as “targeted advertising,” “interactive TV,” or “smart interactivity.” These settings vary by device type.

**Additional Choices**

1.  **User account**. If you have created an account on a Hearst Service, you may be able to review some of your information for that account by logging in and updating your information or user preferences.
2.  **Device Settings**. For relevant Hearst Services, you may be able to review and adjust your preferences by updating the settings on your device (e.g., permitting us to collect precise location information).

For example, you can select the relevant app from “Notifications” (for iOS devices) or “App notifications” (for Android devices) and turn off alerts accordingly.

**Do Not Track/Global Privacy Control**

Hearst does not currently take steps to respond to browser “Do Not Track” signals as no uniform standard to respond to such signals has been developed at this time. We do, however, respond to the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) to the extent required by applicable law, and allow eligible individuals to convey opt-out preferences when we detect the signal. You can learn more about the GPC on the Global Privacy Control website.

Under California law, a Program may be considered a “financial incentive.” Personal information you provide to us in connection with a Program may be used as set out in this Privacy Notice, including for marketing and targeted advertising purposes. 

When you participate in a Program, you agree to any terms that apply to that Program. Although your information collected in connection with the Program, when aggregated with information collected about others, may be of value to us, we are not aware of and so do not determine the value of that information at the individual level. You may elect to revoke your participation in a Program (e.g., by opting out of emails or deleting your account with us).
