This Privacy Notice describes the privacy practices of Hearst only and does not cover the practices of other companies, including those that may advertise or sponsor content, products or services on the Digital Services.

### **B.** **WHAT INFORMATION WE OBTAIN**

When you use a Digital Service, we may obtain various types of information related to you and your use of the Digital Service. This may include information that directly identifies you such as your name, address, or contact information (this type of information may be called “personal information” or “personally identifiable information”). The information we obtain generally consists of information (1) you give us about yourself, (2) you give us about others, (3) automatically collected about your interactions with the Digital Services and our content or ads on third-party websites, apps or other media, and (4) we get from other sources.

#### **1.** **Information you give us**

We may ask you to provide information about yourself when you use the Digital Services. For example, to subscribe to one of our newsletters, you will need to give us an email address. You may not be able to use certain features if you choose not to submit the requested information.

The information you give us may include details such as:

*   Contact information (e.g., name, mailing address, email address or phone number).
*   Demographic, interests and household information (e.g., age, gender or education).
*   Payment information for subscriptions or purchases made through the Digital Services (e.g., payment card number, expiration date and billing information).

*   Information you provide when you choose to participate in surveys, polls, sweepstakes, contests or promotions (including information about your participation in activities that may generate loyalty or rewards points).
*   Location information, which may include precise location information when you permit the Digital Services to access device location. To prevent the collection of precise location information, please refer to instructions provided by your mobile service provider or device manufacturer.

*   Transactional and activity information (e.g., requests, searches or orders).

#### **2\. Information you give us about others**

You may give us information about other people, such as the name and email of a friend or contact with whom you want to share an article or the name and address of a gift subscription recipient. Do not give us information about others unless you are authorized or have their consent to do so. We will use their information for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice.

#### **3.** **Information automatically collected**

The Digital Services automatically log certain information about visits to the Digital Services, such as the number and frequency of visitors, technical information about browsers and devices used to access the Digital Services, and information about crashes or other technical issues. In addition, we and third parties may automatically collect certain information through automated means about your activities over time across the Digital Services as well as across third-party sites, apps or other media. The tools that collect this information vary depending on the Digital Services and include technologies such as cookies, web beacons, tags, scripts, pixels, local shared objects (including HTML5 cookies) and software development kits (“SDKs”). These technologies may be included in our web pages, mobile apps, emails, and other digital content. The tools may assign or collect unique cookie IDs or other identifiers associated with your browser or device. The tools may collect information while you are using our Digital Services or while they are running in the background of your device.

The information automatically collected may include:

*   Information about your computer, device, browser and operating system (e.g., type, model, or version).
*   Internet protocol (IP) address, which may be used to derive your general geographic area (e.g., city and country).
*   Device identifiers (e.g., mobile advertising IDs).
*   Information about your interactions with the Digital Services, including browsing activities and clickstream data that reflect the content you have accessed, clicked on, or viewed.
*   Information about how you accessed the Digital Services, including details about websites or apps visited immediately before or after accessing aDigital Service.

For more information about the use of automated means in the context of interest-based advertising and how you can limit tracking, see [section C. 3 For advertising and marketing purposes, including interest-based advertising](#_INTEREST_BASED).

#### **4.** **Information we obtain from other sources**

We receive information about you from other sources and it may be combined with other information about you. For example, we may obtain data from:

*   Operators of third-party sites or apps, content distribution channels and platforms (e.g., Roku, Amazon Fire TV), voice-activated assistants (e.g., Amazon Alexa, Google Home) or other devices and technologies when you interact with our content, products, services or ads available on those channels and platforms. The information we receive may include information about the content you view or access as well as your demographic information and information about your interests.
*   Third-party data suppliers such as data aggregators, data resellers, public databases and business partners. They may provide us with demographic information, information about your purchases, and other information that helps us learn about you and other users of the Digital Services.
*   Social Media Platforms and similar services (“**Social Media Platforms**”). When you engage with our content or ads on Social Media Platforms, or interact with features on the Digital Services that contain content or features provided by Social Media Platforms (e.g., login or sign in features or tools that allow you to share our content with others on Social Media Platforms), we may obtain information from Social Media Platforms, including your username, user ID, demographic information and other information, subject to the settings and privacy practices of the relevant Social Media Platform. We may obtain this information directly from the Social Media Platform or through plug-ins, integrations or applications. Please keep in mind that the [operators of the Social Media Platforms may also gather information](#_SOCIAL_MEDIA) about your use of the Digital Services and their features and tools.

### **C. HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE OBTAIN**

If you make a purchase or place an order through or in connection with a Digital Service, we use your payment card information (e.g., your card number and expiration date) for limited purposes such as to process your transaction (including recurring payments, if applicable), to provide you with the requested products or services and for the purposes described under the section “To protect our rights or the rights of others” below.

With respect to information other than your payment card information, we use that information:

1.  **To provide you with the Digital Services**. This includes:
    *   Processing your requests regarding the Digital Services and our subscriptions, products or services, or your participation in a survey, sweepstakes, contest, promotion, event or similar initiative.
    *   Providing customer assistance or technical support.
    *   Customizing content, providing recommendations and enhancing the quality and your overall experience with the Digital Services, including by retaining your user preferences or presenting content in the most effective manner for the browser or device you use to access the Digital Services.
    *   Maintaining, operating, improving and developing the Digital Services and related content, products or services, including developing new products and features based on users’ interactions with the Digital Services.
    *   Learning about users of the Digital Services and analyzing how you and others interact with and respond to the Digital Services, including by measuring and optimizing usage, reliability and performance, conducting market research, analyzing trends, and supporting our operations (e.g., for accounting, auditing, financial, legal or other purposes).
  
3.  **To communicate with you**. This includes:
    *   Sending you informational messages about the Digital Services (e.g., to confirm your subscription or notify you of changes to a Digital Service).

    *   Developing, managing and conducting advertising and marketing campaigns, promotions and offers, including about our content, products and services or third parties’ products, services and other initiatives.
    *   Interest-based advertising (also known as targeted or personalized advertising or ads) is advertising based on your interests as inferred from your activities over time on the Digital Services and online services operated by third parties, as well as information from other sources, including information collected offline. Interest-based ads may consist of text ads, images, animations or videos and may be displayed to you based on various factors, including the context of the site or app in which they appear (e.g., sport or travel section), information you provided to the operator of the site or app (e.g., when you created an account), your activities on the site or app (e.g., pages viewed, searches performed or ads clicked), and information such as your demographic, interests and household information.
        *   On the Digital Services and on third-party sites, apps or other media, we, our service providers and third parties may use automated means to (a) collect information for interest-based advertising purposes or (b) serve you interest-based ads. These automated means vary depending on the Digital Services and include technologies such as cookies, web beacons, tags, scripts, pixels, local shared objects (including HTML5 cookies) and SDKs. These technologies may use unique identifiers associated with your browser or device to support interest-based advertising.
        *   We may use and/or combine online and offline information we obtain about you, including your personal information, for interest-based advertising purposes. We may aggregate the information we obtain to create audiences that are most likely to respond to ads based on demographic, interests or household information.
        *   Interest-based ads may be displayed to you by third parties, such as ad networks or exchanges.
        *   There are steps you can take to limit the collection of your information for interest-based advertising purposes. These steps vary for the web and mobile app environments and are browser and device specific. To learn more about interest-based advertising and opt-out choices, see [http://www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) and [in the section Interest-Based Ads Opt-Outs](#_OPT_OUTS).
        *   In serving interest-based ads, we adhere to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising developed by the Digital Advertising Alliance.
    *   Cross-device linking. If you access the Digital Services from multiple browsers or devices, we, our service providers and third parties may try to establish connections among and link the different browsers and devices you use to access the Digital Services and our content or ads published elsewhere. This helps us provide you with a seamless experience across the browsers and devices you use and serve you with more relevant content and ads (e.g., so that we don’t show you the same article twice). See [section Website (Browser) Opt-Outs](#_BROWSER_OPT_OUT) for steps you can take to limit browser and mobile app tracking for interest-based advertising purposes.
    *   Analyzing and measuring the performance, effectiveness and reach of our advertising (including interest-based ads) and marketing efforts on the Digital Services and elsewhere.

#### **Interest-Based Ads Opt-Outs**

We describe below steps you can take to limit tracking of your activities and the delivery of interest-based ads in browsers and mobile apps you use to access the Digital Services. Please keep in mind that if you opt out of interest-based ads, you will still see ads, but these ads will not be based on your inferred interests. In addition, if you take the steps described below, some automated means may still be used to collect information about your interactions with the Digital Services for the other purposes described in this Privacy Notice (e.g., to remember user preferences or enable specific functionality).

The technologies used to deliver ads on websites and mobile apps differ. Please also remember that opt-outs are browser and device-specific.

#### **Website (Browser) Opt-Out**

    *   If you place opt-out cookies but subsequently clear or delete cookies on your computer or device browser, your opt-out cookies may be deleted and you may have to renew your opt-out choices for that specific browser.
    *   The opt-out mechanisms offered by the DAA and NAI are provided by third parties. Hearst does not control or operate these mechanisms or the choices provided through these mechanisms.
    *   The Digital Services may use measurement technology provided by Nielsen, including the Nielsen Digital Ad Ratings (DAR) Service for Google Ad Manager.  To learn more about Nielsen digital measurement products and your choices applicable to them, including in mobile apps and connected devices, please visit [http://www.nielsen.com/digitalprivacy](http://www.nielsen.com/digitalprivacy) for more information.

#### **Mobile App Opt-Out**

In the request, you or your authorized agent must provide information sufficient for us to verify the identity of your agent and that your agent has been properly authorized to act on your behalf;  this may take additional time to fulfill your request.

### **O.** **ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR EUROPEAN VISITORS**

In order to address our legal obligations in Europe (including the UK), Hearst provides the following additional information for Europe-based visitors to Hearst's U.S. Digital Services.

#### **Who is Responsible for Your Information?**

If you use or interact with a Hearst U.S. Digital Service then the data controller will be Hearst Magazine Media, Inc. (except with respect to Car and Driver and Road & Track, for which U.S. Digital Service the data controller will be Hearst Autos, Inc.). The contact details for this entity are provided in the “Contact Us” section above.

#### **Legal Bases for Using Your Information**

We process personal information for different purposes (as described in the “How We Use Information We Obtain” section, above) on the following legal bases:

**To perform our** **contractual** **obligations to you.** We and our service providers process your information to perform our contractual obligations to you when we use your information to provide you with the Digital Services and related content, products or services and to communicate with you. For example, when you purchase a subscription from us, we process your payment and contact information as necessary to confirm the subscription and we process your contact information and other details to provide you with support services you request. We also send you informational communications on this basis, including to confirm a subscription or to notify you of a change to a Digital Service. Failure to provide requested information could prevent or delay the fulfilment of our contractual obligations.

*   **To pursue our legitimate interests.** We process your information to meet our legitimate interests when we use your information to provide you with the Digital Services and related content, products or services, to communicate with you and for our advertising and marketing purposes. For example, our legitimate interests include making improvements to, customizing and understanding how you interact with the Digital Services and related content, products or services, and sending you communications about products and services we think may be of interest to you. To accomplish our legitimate interests, we may share your information with our affiliates and subsidiaries, service providers and business partners (including for our advertising and marketing purposes) and in the context of a corporate transaction. We maintain safeguards to protect the information we process to pursue our legitimate interests.

**To comply with our legal obligations.** We process and share your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations when we use your information to protect our rights or the rights of others and when we share your information with other parties where required by law or as necessary to protect our rights. For example, we are required to collect certain information from you when processing your subscription payment for tax or financial reporting reasons.

*   **With your consent.** We obtain your consent to process your information when we are required to do so by law. If consent is the legal basis on which we process your personal information, you can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us using the information provided in the “Contact Us” section above.

#### **Your Rights Over Your Information**

In certain circumstances, you have a right to access or object to the use of personal information held about you (including in relation to direct marketing). You can also ask us to rectify, update, erase, restrict or to share your information in a usable format with another company. Such requests are subject to applicable law.

We encourage you to contact us to update or correct your information if it changes or if the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate.

If you would like to discuss or exercise such rights, please contact us at [datarequestsmagazines@hearst.com](mailto:datarequestsmagazines@hearst.com). We will contact you if we need additional information from you in order to honor your requests.

#### **Storing Your Information**

We will keep your personal information for as long as we have a relationship with you. Once our relationship with you has come to an end, we will retain your personal information for a period of time that enables us to:

*   Maintain business records for analysis, understanding market trends and/or audit purposes and to improve the Digital Services.
*   Comply with record retention requirements under applicable laws or other relevant legal or regulatory requirements.
*   Defend, establish, exercise or bring any existing or potential legal claims.
*   Carry out fraud detection and prevention.
*   Deal with any complaints regarding the Digital Services, our products and services.

We will delete your personal information when it is no longer required for these purposes. If there is any information that we are unable, for technical reasons, to delete from our systems, we will put in place appropriate measures to prevent any further processing or use of the data.

#### **International Data Transfers**

Information collected through the Digital Services will be processed in and subject to the laws of the United States, which may not provide the same level of protection for your personal information as your home country. If we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area, United Kingdom and Switzerland we put in place safeguards. In particular, such safeguards include the European Commission-approved standard contractual clauses. For more information on these safeguards, please  contact us at the details provided in the “Contact Us” section above. We participate in the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield frameworks.  Read our [Privacy Shield Statement](https://www.hearst.com/-/privacy-shield-statement) to learn more.

#### **Changes to the Privacy Notice**

Where changes to this Privacy Notice have a fundamental impact on the nature of the processing or otherwise have a substantial impact on you, we will give you advanced notice so that you have the opportunity to exercise your rights (e.g. to object to the processing).
