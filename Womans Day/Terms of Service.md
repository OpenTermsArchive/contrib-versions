### 7\. User Content

“User Content” means any and all information and content that a user submits to, or uses with, the Magazine Services (e.g., photos, audio, video, messages, text, files, or other content you provide us), except any Feedback. You are solely responsible for your User Content. User Content may include unsolicited or invited submissions. You assume all risks associated with use of your User Content, including any reliance on its accuracy, completeness or usefulness by others, or any disclosure of your User Content that makes you or any third party personally identifiable. You may not state or imply that your User Content is in any way provided, sponsored or endorsed by Hearst. Because you alone are responsible for your User Content (including backing up your data), you may expose yourself to liability. Under no circumstance will Hearst be liable for any inaccuracy or defect in any User Content.

You hereby grant, and you represent and warrant that you have the right to grant, to Hearst an irrevocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free and fully paid, worldwide license to reproduce, distribute, publicly display and perform, prepare derivative works of, incorporate into other works, and otherwise use your User Content, and to grant sublicenses of the foregoing, for any lawful purpose. You agree to irrevocably waive (and cause to be waived) any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to your User Content.

Because we do not control User Content, you acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for any User Content and we make no guarantees regarding the accuracy, currency, suitability, or quality of any User Content, and we assume no responsibility for any User Content. Your interactions with other users of the Magazine Services are solely between you and such user. You agree that Hearst will not be responsible for any loss or damage incurred as the result of any such interactions. If there is a dispute between you and any user of the Magazine Services, we are under no obligation to become involved. You acknowledge that other users may post comments about your User Content which may be derogatory, and Hearst has no obligation to monitor or delete any such User Content. Hearst may remove or modify any User Content without notice or liability at any time in Hearst’s sole discretion.

### 8\. User Submissions

If you provide us with personal anecdotes, they may be attributed to you. Hearst can edit, rewrite, use, and reuse the User Content, including your name, likeness, photograph, and biographical information you provide, with or without attribution, including publication in the Magazine Services or our publications, advertising or sponsored content.

Invited Submissions

From time to time, the Magazine Services may expressly request submissions of concepts, stories, or other potential content from you (“Invited Submissions”). Please carefully read any specific rules or other terms and conditions that appear in connection with such Invited Submissions as such terms and conditions will govern the submissions and may affect your legal rights. If no such additional terms govern those submissions, then this Agreement will apply in full to any Invited Submissions you make. IN ANY EVENT, ANY MATERIAL YOU SEND TO US WILL NOT BE TREATED AS CONFIDENTIAL. Regardless of any industry custom or practice, we will not pay you for the use of any content that you submit to through the Magazine Services.

### 9\. Enforcement

If we become aware of a user’s violation of this Agreement, including the rights of any third party, we may take certain remedial steps, including refusing access to the Magazine Services to any person or entity and change eligibility requirements at any time.

If we become aware that any of our users has repeatedly infringed the proprietary rights of any third party, we may take steps to terminate that user’s access to the Magazine Services. We reserve the right (but have no obligation) to review any User Content, investigate, and/or take appropriate action against you in our sole discretion. Such acts may include removing or modifying your User Content, terminating your access to the Magazine Services (including any user account, registration or membership), legal action and/or reporting you to law enforcement authorities. If Hearst elects to modify User Content, Hearst nonetheless assumes no responsibility for the User Content.

Hearst reserves the right to investigate suspected violations of this Agreement, including without limitation, any violation arising from any User Content (including unsolicited or invited submissions), postings or emails you make on or send through the Magazine Services. Hearst may seek to gather information from the user who is suspected of violating this Agreement and from any other user. Hearst may suspend any users whose conduct or postings are under investigation and may remove such material from its servers as it deems appropriate and without notice. If Hearst believes, in its sole discretion, that a violation of this Agreement has occurred, it may edit or modify any submission, posting or emails, remove the material permanently, cancel postings, warn users, suspend users and passwords, terminate accounts, or take other corrective action it deems appropriate. Hearst may cooperate with law enforcement authorities or court order requesting or directing Hearst to disclose the identity of anyone posting any emails, or publishing or otherwise making available any materials that are believed to violate this Agreement. BY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT, YOU WAIVE AND HOLD HARMLESS HEARST (and its affiliates and its and their officers, directors, employees, contractors, and agents) FROM ANY CLAIMS RESULTING FROM ANY ACTION TAKEN BY HEARST (AND ITS AFFILIATES AND ITS AND THEIR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, AND AGENTS) DURING OR AS A RESULT OF ITS INVESTIGATIONS AND/OR FROM ANY ACTIONS TAKEN AS A CONSEQUNCE OF INVESTIGATIONS BY EITHER HEARST OR LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES.
