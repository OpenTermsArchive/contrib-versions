If you opt to import your address book, we receive your contacts (including contact information your service provider(s) or app automatically added to your address book when you communicated with addresses or numbers not already in your list).

We also allow some others to use cookies as described in our Cookie Policy. If you are outside the Designated Countries, we also collect (or rely on others who collect) information about your device where you have not engaged with our Services (e.g., ad ID, IP address, operating system and browser information) so we can provide our Members with relevant ads and better understand their effectiveness. [Learn more](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/111735).

We also get information about your network and device (e.g., IP address, proxy server, operating system, web browser and add-ons, device identifier and features, cookie IDs and/or ISP, or your mobile carrier). If you use our Services from a mobile device, that device will send us data about your location based on your phone settings.

We also use [automatic scanning](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/79855) technology on messages to support and protect our site. For example, we use this technology to suggest possible responses to messages and to manage or block content that violates our User Agreement or [Professional Community Policies](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/professional-community-policies) from our Services.
    
    ### 1.7 Workplace and School Provided Information
    
    When your organization (e.g., employer or school) buys a premium Service for you to use, they give us data about you.
    
    Others buying our Services for your use, such as your employer or your school, provide us with personal data about you and your eligibility to use the Services that they purchase for use by their workers, students or alumni. For example, we will get contact information for [Company Page](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/1561) administrators and for authorizing users of our premium Services, such as our recruiting, sales or learning products.

    ### 1.9 Other
    
    We are improving our Services, which means we get new data and create new ways to use data.
    
    Our Services are dynamic, and we often introduce new features, which may require the collection of new information. If we collect materially different personal data or materially change how we collect, use or share your data, we will notify you and may also modify this Privacy Policy.

3.  2\. How We Use Your Data
    ------------------------
    
    We use your data to provide, support, personalize and develop our Services.
    
    How we use your personal data will depend on which Services you use, how you use those Services and the choices you make in your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/). We use the data that we have about you to provide and personalize our Services, including with the help of automated systems and inferences we make, so that our Services (including ads) can be more relevant and useful to you and others.
    
    ### 2.1 Services
    
    Our Services help you connect with others, find and be found for work and business opportunities, stay informed, get training and be more productive.
    
    We use your data to authorize access to our Services and honor your settings.
    
    #### Stay Connected
    
    Our Services allow you to stay in touch and up to date with colleagues, partners, clients, and other professional contacts. To do so, you can connect with the professionals who you choose, and who also wish to connect with you. Subject to your and their [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/), when you connect with other Members, you will be able to search each others connections in order to exchange professional opportunities.
    
    We use data about you (such as your profile, profiles you have viewed or data provided through address book uploads or partner integrations) to help others find your profile, suggest connections for you and others (e.g. Members who share your contacts or job experiences) and enable you to invite others to become a Member and connect with you. You can also opt-in to allow us to use your precise location or proximity to others for certain tasks (e.g. to suggest other [nearby](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/75689) Members for you to connect with, calculate the commute to a new job, or notify your connections that you are at a professional event).
    
    It is your choice whether to invite someone to our Services, send a connection request, or allow another Member to become your connection. When you invite someone to connect with you, your invitation will include your network and basic profile information (e.g., name, profile photo, job title, region). We will send invitation reminders to the person you invited. You can [choose](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/connections-visibility) whether or not to share your own list of connections with your connections.
    
    Visitors have [choices](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls) about how we use their data.
    
    #### Stay Informed
    
    Our Services allow you to stay informed about news, events and ideas regarding professional topics you care about, and from professionals you respect. Our Services also allow you to improve your professional skills, or learn new ones. We use the data we have about you (e.g., data you provide, data we collect from your engagement with our Services and inferences we make from the data we have about you), to personalize our Services for you, such as by recommending or ranking relevant content and conversations on our Services. We also use the data we have about you to suggest skills you could add to your profile and skills that you might need to pursue your next opportunity. So, if you let us know that you are interested in a new skill (e.g., by watching a learning video), we will use this information to personalize content in your feed, suggest that you follow certain members on our site, or suggest related learning content to help you towards that new skill. We use your content, activity and other data, including your name and photo, to provide notices to your network and others. For example, subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/), we may notify others that you have updated your profile, posted content, took a [social action](#key-terms-2), used a feature, made new connections or were [mentioned in the news](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/50021).
    
    #### Career
    
    Our Services allow you to explore careers, evaluate educational opportunities, and seek out, and be found for, career opportunities. Your profile can be found by those looking to hire (for a job or a [specific task](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/67214)) or be hired by you. We will use your data to recommend jobs or mentees, show you and others relevant professional contacts (e.g., who work at a company, in an industry, function or location or have certain skills and connections). You can signal that you are [interested](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/67405) in changing jobs and share information with recruiters. We will use your data to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters. We may use automated systems to provide content and recommendations to help make our Services more relevant to our Members, Visitors and customers. Keeping your profile accurate and up-to-date may help you better connect to others and to opportunities through our Services.
    
    #### Productivity
    
    Our Services allow you to collaborate with colleagues, search for potential clients, customers, partners and others to do business with. Our Services allow you to communicate with other Members and schedule and prepare meetings with them. If your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/) allow, we scan messages to provide bots or similar tools that facilitate tasks such as scheduling meetings, drafting responses, summarizing messages or recommending next steps. [Learn more](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/79855).
    
    ### 2.2 Premium Services
    
    Our premium Services help paying users to search for and contact Members through our Services, such as searching for and contacting job candidates, sales leads and co-workers, manage talent and promote content through social media.
    
    We sell premium Services that provide our customers and subscribers with customized-search functionality and tools (including messaging and activity alerts) as part of our talent, marketing and sales solutions. Customers can export limited information from your profile, such as name, headline, current company, current title, and general location (e.g., Dublin), such as to manage sales leads or talent, unless you [opt-out](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/data-sharing). We do not provide contact information to customers as part of these premium Services without your consent. Premium Services customers can store information they have about you in our premium Services, such as a resume or contact information or sales history. The data stored about you by these customers is subject to the policies of those customers. Other enterprise Services and features that use your data include [TeamLink](https://www.linkedin.com/help/sales-navigator/answer/50216/teamlink-overview) and [Elevate](https://business.linkedin.com/elevate) (social promotion of content).
    
    ### 2.3 Communications
    
    We contact you and enable communications between Members. We offer settings to control what messages you receive and how often you receive some types of messages.
    
    We will contact you through email, mobile phone, notices posted on our websites or apps, messages to your LinkedIn inbox, and other ways through our Services, including text messages and push notifications. We will send you messages about the availability of our Services, security, or other service-related issues. We also send messages about how to use our Services, network updates, reminders, job suggestions and promotional messages from us and our partners. You may change your communication [preferences](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/messages) at any time. Please be aware that you cannot opt out of receiving service messages from us, including security and legal notices.
    
    We also enable [communications](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/137) between you and others through our Services, including for example [invitations](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/115), [InMail](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/1584), [groups](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/1164) and [messages](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/1645) between connections.
    
    ### 2.4 Advertising
    
    We serve you tailored ads both on and off our Services. We offer you choices regarding personalized ads, but you cannot opt-out of seeing other ads.
    
    We target (and measure the performance of) ads to Members, Visitors and others both on and off our Services directly or through a variety of partners, using the following data, whether separately or combined:
    
    *   Data from advertising technologies on and off our Services, pixels, ad tags, cookies, and device identifiers;
    *   Member-provided information (e.g., profile, contact information, title and industry);
    *   Data from your use of our Services (e.g., search history, feed, content you read, who you follow or is following you, connections, [groups](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/1164) participation, page visits, videos you watch, clicking on an ad, etc.), including as described in Section 1.3;
    *   Information from advertising [partners](#key-terms-2), vendors and [publishers](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/85809); and
    *   Information inferred from data described above (e.g., using job titles from a profile to infer industry, seniority, and compensation bracket; using graduation dates to infer age or using first names or pronoun usage to infer gender; using your feed activity to infer your interests; or using device data to recognize you as a Member).
    
    We will show you ads called [sponsored content](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/39575) which look similar to non-sponsored content, except that they are labeled as advertising (e.g., as ad or sponsored). If you take a social action (such as like, comment or share) on these ads, your action is associated with your name and viewable by others, including the advertiser. Subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/data-visibility), if you take a social action on the LinkedIn Services, that action may be mentioned with related ads. For example, when you like a company we may include your name and photo when their sponsored content is shown.
    
    #### Ad Choices
    
    We adhere to [self-regulatory principles](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/62931) for interest-based advertising and participate in industry [opt-outs](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/62931) from such ads. This does not opt you out of receiving advertising; you will continue to get other ads by advertisers not listed with these self regulatory tools. You can also [opt-out](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/enhanced-advertising) specifically from our uses of certain categories of data to show you more relevant ads. For Visitors, the setting is [here](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls).
    
    #### Info to Ad Providers
    
    We do not share your personal data with any third-party advertisers or ad networks except for: (i) hashed IDs or device identifiers (to the extent they are personal data in some countries); (ii) with your separate permission (e.g., in a lead generation form) or (iii) data already visible to any users of the Services (e.g., profile). However, if you view or click on an ad on or off our Services, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may, through the use of mechanisms such as cookies, determine it is you. Advertising partners can associate personal data collected by the advertiser directly from you with hashed IDs or device identifiers received from us. In such instances, we seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so.
    
    ### 2.5 Marketing
    
    We promote our Services to you and others.
    
    In addition to advertising our Services, we use Members data and content for invitations and communications promoting membership and network growth, engagement and our Services, such as by showing your connections that you have used a feature on our Services.
    
    ### 2.6 Developing Services and Research
    
    We develop our Services and conduct research
    
    #### Service Development
    
    We use data, including public feedback, to conduct [research](https://engineering.linkedin.com/ab-testing/xlnt-platform-driving-ab-testing-linkedin) and development for our Services in order to provide you and others with a better, more intuitive and personalized experience, drive membership growth and engagement on our Services, and help connect professionals to each other and to economic opportunity.
    
    #### Other Research
    
    We seek to create economic opportunity for Members of the global workforce and to help them be more productive and successful. We use the personal data available to us to research social, economic and workplace trends, such as jobs availability and skills needed for these [jobs](https://blog.linkedin.com/2017/february/3/introducing-the-linkedin-workforce-report) and policies that help bridge the gap in various industries and geographic areas. In some cases, we work with trusted third parties to perform this research, under [controls](https://engineering.linkedin.com/teams/data/projects/economic-graph-research/economic-graph-details#data-privacy) that are designed to protect your privacy. We publish or allow others to publish economic insights, presented as aggregated data rather than personal data.
    
    #### Surveys
    
    Polls and surveys are conducted by us and others through our Services. You are not obligated to respond to polls or surveys, and you have choices about the information you provide. You may [opt-out](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/research-invitations) of survey invitations.
    
    ### 2.7 Customer Support
    
    We use data to help you and fix problems.

    ### 2.9 Security and Investigations
    
    We use data for security, fraud prevention and investigations.
    
    We use your data (including your communications) for security purposes or to prevent or investigate possible fraud or other violations of our [User Agreement](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement) and/or attempts to harm our Members, Visitors or others.
    
    #### Social Action
    
    E.g. like, comment, follow, share 
    
    #### Partners
    
    Partners include ad networks, exchanges and others

    *   When you like or re-share or comment on anothers content (including ads), others will be able to view these social actions and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it).
    
    Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages.
    
    #### Enterprise Accounts
    
    Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services.
    
    Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their social selling index, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services).
    
    Subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/privacy), when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services.
    
    ### 3.2 Communication Archival
    
    Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service.
    
    Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license.
    
    ### 3.3 Others Services
    
    You may link your account with others services so that they can look up your contacts profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others.
    
    Subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/privacy), other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may [revoke](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/account) the link with such accounts.
    
    Subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/data-sharing), excerpts from your [profile](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/79854) will appear on the services of others (e.g., search engine results, mail and calendar applications that show a user limited profile data of the person they are meeting or messaging, [social media aggregators](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/79854), talent and lead managers). Old profile information remains on these services until they update their data cache with changes you made to your profile.
    
    ### 3.4 Related Services
    
    We share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities.
    
    We will share your personal data with our affiliates to provide and develop our Services. We may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history.
    
    ### 3.5 Service Providers
    
    We may use others to help us with our Services.
    
    We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, marketing and development). They will have access to your information as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes.
    
    ### 3.6 Legal Disclosures
    
    We may need to share your data when we believe its required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others.
    
    It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our [Data Request Guidelines](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/16880) and [Transparency Report](https://about.linkedin.com/transparency).
    
    ### 3.7 Change in Control or Sale
    
    We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
    
    We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.

    Information you have shared with others (e.g., through InMail, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you close your account or delete the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members have copied out of our Services. Groups content and ratings or review content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source.
