Cookie Policy
=============

Effective on October 1, 2020

At LinkedIn, we believe in being clear and open about how we collect and use data related to you. This Cookie Policy applies to any LinkedIn product or service that links to this policy or incorporates it by reference. We use cookies and similar technologies such as pixels, local storage and mobile ad IDs (collectively referred to in this policy as “cookies”) to collect and use data as part of our Services, as defined in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy) (“Services”).

What technologies are used?
---------------------------

ENTER A SUMMARY

| Type of technology | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Cookies | A cookie is a small file placed onto your device that enables LinkedIn features and functionality. Any browser visiting our sites may receive cookies from us or cookies from third parties such as our customers, partners or service providers. We or third parties may also place cookies in your browser when you visit non-LinkedIn sites that display ads or that host our plugins or [tags](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/65521).<br><br>We use two types of cookies: persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie lasts beyond the current session and is used for many purposes, such as recognizing you as an existing user, so it’s easier to return to LinkedIn and interact with our Services without signing in again. Since a persistent cookie stays in your browser, it will be read by LinkedIn when you return to one of our sites or visit a third party site that uses our Services. Session cookies last only as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session). |
| Pixels | A pixel is a tiny image that may be embedded within web pages and emails, requiring a call (which provides device and visit information) to our servers in order for the pixel to be rendered in those web pages and emails. We use pixels to learn more about your interactions with email content or web content, such as whether you interacted with ads or posts. Pixels can also enable us and third parties to place cookies on your browser. |
| Local storage | Local storage enables a website or application to store information locally on your device(s). Local storage may be used to improve the LinkedIn experience, for example, by enabling features, remembering your preferences and speeding up site functionality. |
| Other similar technologies | We also use other tracking technologies, such as mobile advertising IDs and tags for similar purposes as described in this Cookie Policy. |

  

Our [cookie tables](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/l/cookie-table) list some of the cookies that are used by us and third parties as part of our Services. Please note that these tables may be updated from time to time to provide you with the latest information.

Some mobile device operating systems such as Android and iOS provide the ability to control the use of mobile advertising IDs for ads personalization. You can learn how to use these controls by visiting the manufacturer’s website for both Android and iOS.

### Browser Controls

Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings, which may be adapted to reflect your consent to the use of cookies. Further, most browsers also enable you to review and erase cookies, including LinkedIn cookies. To learn more about browser controls, please consult the documentation that your browser manufacturer provides.

Where required, we enable you to reject the use of certain cookies for purposes such as advertising and analytics and research, by visiting your cookie settings, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on your consent before its withdrawal. For members, your settings can be found [here](http://www.linkedin.com/psettings/member-cookies).

### What is Do Not Track (DNT)?

DNT is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites by using browser settings. As such, LinkedIn does not generally respond to “do not track” signals.
