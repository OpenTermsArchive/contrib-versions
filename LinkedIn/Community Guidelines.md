LinkedIn Professional Community Policies
========================================

Thank you for using LinkedIn, where the world’s professionals come together to find jobs, stay informed, learn new skills, and build productive relationships. The content that you contribute should add to the LinkedIn community in a constructive manner. Additional information on what that means, is laid out below. You should also review our [Publishing Platform Guidelines](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/47545). Together we can make our community a place where everyone is able to learn, grow, and communicate, which, in turn, helps create economic opportunity for everyone.

*   ### Tell us if you see abusive content
    
    If you see something you believe may violate our policies, whether in profiles, posts, messages, comments, or anywhere else, please [report it to us](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/146). Combined with our automated defenses, these reports help us identify and prevent abuse. Please use the reporting tools responsibly and only for their intended purposes. To learn more about how to report inappropriate content, behavior, or members, visit our [Safety Center](https://safety.linkedin.com/identifying-abuse).
    
*   ### Violating our community policies can result in action against your account or content
    
    These policies apply to all members. Depending on the severity of violation, we may limit the visibility of certain content, label it, or remove it entirely. Repeated or egregious offenses will result in account restriction. If you believe action taken on your content or your account was in error, you can submit an [appeal](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/82934).
