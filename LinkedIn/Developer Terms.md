API Terms of Use

We’re excited that you’ve chosen to develop on the LinkedIn platform. Our mission is to connect the world’s professionals to allow them to be more productive and successful.  To achieve that mission, our Developer Program enables you to create innovative professional applications that make the best use of the LinkedIn platform, while honoring members’ choice and control over their personal data. When you develop on the LinkedIn platform you are agreeing to be bound by the following terms, so please take a few minutes to review the LinkedIn API Terms of Use below.

Last revised on March 25, 2019.

1\. Introduction
----------------

When you develop on our platform you are entering into a legal agreement and you agree to all of these terms.

As a member of LinkedIn, you also have agreed to our [User Agreement](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement), [Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy) and [Cookie Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy) - these terms are additional agreements with LinkedIn relating specifically to your use of our APIs.

**1.1 About Us and These API Terms of Use**
-------------------------------------------

You agree that by developing on the LinkedIn platform, you are agreeing to enter into a legally binding contract with LinkedIn Corporation (if you are an individual residing outside of the Designated Countries or if you are a business entity with a principal place of business outside of or with a headquarters based outside of the Designated Countries), 1000 West Maude Avenue, Sunnyvale, California 94085, USA or LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company (if you are an individual residing in the Designated Countries or if you are a business entity with a principal place of business in or with headquarters based in the Designated Countries), Gardner House, Wilton Plaza, Wilton Place, Dublin 2, Ireland (“we,” “us,” “our,” and “LinkedIn”).

We use the term “Designated Countries” to refer to countries in the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA) as well as Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

By registering a software application, website, or product or service you offer (an “Application”) at the [LinkedIn developer site](https://developer.linkedin.com/) (the “Developer Site”), you acknowledge that you are currently a member of LinkedIn in good standing and have understood and agree to be bound by these LinkedIn API Terms of Use (the “Terms”).

If you are developing on our platform on behalf of a company or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to register an Application on behalf of that entity and bind it to these Terms. If you are not authorized, you may not accept the Terms or register an Application for someone else.

These Terms govern your use of our APIs. If you have executed another agreement with us related to your use of our APIs, then those terms would control your use of our APIs.

  
LinkedIn also offers a variety of plugins, governed by these Terms and the LinkedIn [Plugins License Agreement](https://developer.linkedin.com/legal/plugin-terms-of-use).

**1.2 Scope and Intent**
------------------------

LinkedIn makes APIs available to developers as follows:

(1) "**Self-Serve API Program**" where you can develop Applications using APIs that are available to you immediately upon registration for an API key on our Developer Site if you meet the Self-Serve API Program eligibility criteria set forth below and have agreed to these Terms; and

(2) "**Vetted API Program(s)**" where you can develop Applications using APIs that are available only to developers that meet the applicable Vetted API Program eligibility criteria and have agreed to these Terms and any additional Vetted API Program terms and conditions ("**Additional Terms**"), which are incorporated by reference into the Terms.

With respect to a Vetted API Program, these API Terms of Use shall apply except where there is conflict with the applicable Additional Terms, in which case such Additional Terms shall control.  

These Terms shall apply to any use of our APIs unless you have executed a separate signed partnership agreement, in which case that agreement shall apply ("**Partner Program**").  LinkedIn also offers a variety of plugins you can integrate into your website to allow visitors to access and view Content from LinkedIn websites if you have agreed to be bound, in addition to these Terms, to the LinkedIn [Plugins License Agreement](https://developer.linkedin.com/legal/plugin-terms-of-use).

As used in these Terms, "**APIs**" means programmatic web APIs, software and other functionality and their associated tools and documentation that LinkedIn makes available on the Developer Site.

In addition to compliance with these Terms, your use of our APIs and Content must comply with the Developer Documentation that we provide to you.

**1.3 Developer Documentation**
-------------------------------

Your use of any of our APIs and display of Content in your Application must comply with the technical documentation, usage guidelines, call volume limits, and other documentation maintained at the Developer Site or otherwise made available to you (together, the “**Developer Documentation**”, which are expressly incorporated into these Terms by reference).  “**Content**” means any data or content from our Services or accessed via the APIs.  “**Services**” means LinkedIn.com, LinkedIn-branded apps, Slideshare, LinkedIn Learning and other LinkedIn-related sites, apps, communications and services and technology related thereto.

In the event of any conflict between the Developer Documentation and these Terms, these Terms shall control.  

You may use the self-serve APIs if your Application follows these Terms, the Developer Documentation, and is designed to help Members be more productive and successful.

You may not use the APIs if your Application: exceeds a reasonable amount of API calls; relies fundamentally on the APIs; or is used for hiring, marketing, selling, or learning.

**1.4 Self-Serve API Program Eligibility Criteria**

In addition to your compliance with the other requirements and obligations set forth in these Terms, you may participate in the Self-Serve API Program and display Content retrieved via the applicable APIs in your Application if:

1.     you are developing an Application designed to help LinkedIn registered users (“**Members**”) be more productive and successful across the web; for example, by augmenting their profile and professional brand in an Application for publishing, discussing and sharing content with like-minded professionals.

2.     your Application is NOT expected to have more than 100,000 lifetime users.

3.     your Application DOES NOT make more than 250,000 daily calls to an API.

4.     your Application DOES NOT rely on access to the APIs as a fundamental aspect of your business.

5.     your Application DOES NOT target current or potential paying customers of LinkedIn products or people engaging in activities related to those products—in other words, Applications used for hiring, marketing, selling, or learning. Here are some examples (and exceptions) of what we mean by hiring, marketing, selling, and learning:  
  
**Hiring**: Applications to find a job or fill a job, such as ones used to advertise, post, apply for, search for, recommend, refer, suggest, enhance listings for, or fill permanent jobs, contract positions, or volunteer opportunities, or for anything with similar functionality (you can, however, use the APIs to develop an Application to let people apply for a job at your company on your company’s career site, as long as it abides by the [specifications set forth](https://developer.linkedin.com/docs/apply-with-linkedin) [here](https://developer.linkedin.com/docs/apply-with-linkedin)).  
  
**Marketing**: Applications used by marketers or their customers for marketing campaigns, lead generation, campaign analysis, or for anything with similar functionality (for example, your Application may not use our APIs to create or supplement user segments for targeting by ad campaigns).  
  
**Selling**: Applications used by sales or other selling professionals for generating or finding prospects or leads, for sales intelligence or training, for relationship management, for systematic matching of individuals with their LinkedIn profiles, or for anything with similar functionality.

**Learning**: Applications used to surface or deliver professional learning content to users or other platforms, or track and manage learning activity, or with functionality to post professional credentials to other platforms.  You can, however, use Sign In With LinkedIn on platforms that surface or deliver other types of learning content.

If your Application does not satisfy the above eligibility criteria, you may be eligible for a Vetted API Program or a Partner Program. For more information about those API programs’ application processes, eligibility criteria and the areas where we are seeking partners, please check the [Developer Site](https://developer.linkedin.com/partner-programs).

2\. Access to the APIs
----------------------

To access the APIs you must sign-in to LinkedIn, and register an Application.

We may use the information you share with LinkedIn for various purposes as described in these Terms.

**2.1   Application Registration**

To begin using the APIs, you must first sign-in to LinkedIn using your personal or corporate LinkedIn account username and password, and then register your Application by clicking [My Apps](https://www.linkedin.com/developer/apps) and following the instructions provided thereafter. Both the Application registration and your Member account must contain accurate and up-to-date information at all times, including your current title, company, and e-mail address.

You agree that we can use, store, and share information submitted by you to LinkedIn in connection with your Application to contact you, for attribution purposes, handling inquiries from Members or potential Members about your Application, for other purposes under these Terms (for example, we may email you with updates regarding the developer program), and as otherwise permitted in our Privacy Policy.  You acknowledge that if you share the contact information of your employees or independent contractors with us, we may contact them in accordance with these Terms.

Once you have successfully registered an Application and met the other requirements for a particular API, you will be given the necessary credentials to access that API.

All activities that occur using those access credentials are your responsibility.

**2.2   Access Credentials**

Once you have successfully registered an Application and met the other requirements for a particular API, you will be given Access Credentials for your Application. “**Access Credentials**” means the necessary security keys, secrets, tokens, and other credentials to access the applicable APIs. The Access Credentials enable us to associate your API activity with your Application and the Members using it. All activities that occur using your Access Credentials are your responsibility. Keep your Access Credentials secret. Do not sell, share, transfer, or sublicense them to any other party other than your employees or independent contractors in accordance with Section 3.1 below. Do not try to circumvent them and do not require your users to obtain their own Access Credentials to use your Application (for example, in an attempt to circumvent call limits).

You may create LinkedIn test profiles to test your Application, provided that they do not interact with real Members or company or other organization pages on LinkedIn.

**2.3   Test Profiles**

You may create up to five test LinkedIn profiles for purposes of testing your Application only. You must create the profiles manually and not via automated means, such as scripts.

Test profiles must: (a) be standard LinkedIn member profiles; (b) not interact with non-test profiles (for example, you cannot use test accounts to comment on posts and you cannot connect test profiles with non-test profiles, such as your own personal LinkedIn profile); and (c) not override our API call limits.  You must clearly identify the profiles as test profiles, and you must identify these additional account profiles as “developers” in your Application registration. You may not create any profile positions at real companies (besides your own) for the test profiles.

If you agree to and follow these Terms, you are permitted to use our APIs in connection with your Application.

**2.4   API License**

Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable (except to independent contractors so they may host, develop, test, operate, modify or support your Application in accordance with Section 3.1), non-transferable, non-assignable license under LinkedIn’s intellectual property rights during the Duration (as defined in Section 11.1, below) (a) to use the APIs to develop, test, operate and support your Application; (b) to distribute or allow access to your integration of the APIs within your Application to end users of your Application; and (c) to display the Content accessed through the APIs within your Application.

You have no right to distribute or allow access to the stand-alone APIs.

**b.**    Use the APIs to retrieve Content that is then aggregated with third party data in such a way that an end user cannot attribute the Content to LinkedIn (i.e., aggregated search results). 

4\. Storage of Content
----------------------

You may not store any Content, except in the specific circumstances outlined.

**4.1   No Storing Any Content**

You must not capture, copy or store any Content or any information expressed by the Content (such as hashed or transformed data), except to the extent permitted by these Terms.

You must store all Content in a manner which enables you to identify, segregate and selectively delete such Content.  The Content must not be stored in a data repository that would enable any third party access (other than the customer or Member to which it relates).   

You may store the Application-specific Member tokens and authentication tokens acquired on a Member’s behalf.

**4.2   You May Store Tokens**

You may store the Application-specific alphanumeric user IDs that we provide to you for identifying users of your Application (“**Member Tokens**”) or the authentication tokens that we provide to you when a Member authenticates your Application to their LinkedIn account (“**OAuth Access Tokens**”).

Solely to improve the user experience, you may cache Content for up to 24 hours.

**4.3   Caching Content for Performance**

Solely to improve your Application’s performance, you may cache the Content for up to 24 hours from a request for that Content through the APIs before permanent deletion. Unless otherwise set forth in this Section 4 or in any applicable Additional Terms, you do not have any right to store the Content beyond this limited 24 hour period.

You may store profile data if you have the legally valid [consent](https://developer.linkedin.com/legal/storing-member-data) [of the Member](https://developer.linkedin.com/legal/storing-member-data) to do so.

You may only refresh profile data when the Member is actively using your Application (i.e., not offline).

**4.4   Member Profile Data**

You must obtain legally valid consent from a Member before you may store that Member's Profile Data (for example, so that a Member applying for a job at your company can provide you with a copy of their LinkedIn profile). 

In addition to the requirements set forth below in Section 5, the process for obtaining Member consent to store their data must, at a minimum, meet the [specifications set forth](https://developer.linkedin.com/legal/storing-member-data) [here](https://developer.linkedin.com/legal/storing-member-data). “**Profile Data**” means any or all of a Member’s profile data available through an applicable API, subject to a Member’s profile visibility and other privacy settings. Profile Data excludes a Member’s network, network updates, job listings, groups, companies, and any other content. 

If you want to refresh the Member’s Profile Data, you may only do so when the Member is actually using your Application and not on an automated schedule.

You must delete all Member data when that Member requests deletion, uninstalls your Application or closes their account.

You do not need to delete data that a Member provides directly to you.

**4.5   Delete at Member Request**

You must immediately delete all Content collected through the APIs about a particular Member, including the Member Token and the OAuth Access Token, upon request by that Member, when the Member uninstalls your Application or when the Member closes their account with you.  

The restrictions of this Section do not apply to data that Members provide directly to you and that is separately entered or uploaded to you by the user of your Application.

If we notify you that you have breached these Terms, you must delete all stored LinkedIn data.

**4.6   Delete for Breach**

You must immediately delete all Content if we terminate your use of the APIs for breach of these Terms, except when doing so would cause you to violate any law or obligation imposed by a governmental authority.

If you process Covered Data received from us you must agree to LinkedIn’s Data Processing Agreement.

**4.7   Data Protection** 

The term “**Covered Data**” has the meaning given to the term “personal data” under the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“**GDPR**”).  To the extent either party processes Covered Data received from the other party, the parties agree that the LinkedIn Data Processing Agreement, currently located at [https://legal.linkedin.com/bd-dpa](https://legal.linkedin.com/bd-dpa), shall govern such processing and is expressly incorporated by reference herein.

5\. Don't Harm or Trick Members
-------------------------------

Your Application must include your own user agreement and privacy policy which are readily available to your users.

If your Application requests data from Members, you will tell them what data is being collected and how it’s used.

If your Application is an enterprise application, you will enter into separate agreements with your customers.

**5.1   Your User Agreement and Privacy Policy**

Your Application must include your own user agreement and privacy policy. Your user agreement and privacy policy must be prominently identified or located where members download or access your Application.  Your privacy practices must meet applicable legal standards and accurately disclose the collection, use, storage and sharing of data.

If your Application is an enterprise application, you must enter into customer agreements with your enterprise customers that describe how you will be accessing LinkedIn accounts and Content on the customer’s behalf.

You must promptly notify us of any breaches of your user agreement or privacy policy that impact or may impact Members. Your privacy policy must be at least as stringent and user-friendly as LinkedIn’s.

You must tell Members what information your Application collects and how it’s used.

**5.2 LinkedIn Member Consent**

Before obtaining information from Members, you must obtain their legally valid consent which, at a minimum, shall include: (a) how their data will be used, (b) when it will be collected (e.g., will the Application pull a Member’s Profile Data more than once); and (c) how a user can withdraw their consent.  The consent must be freely given (in accordance with applicable law) and given by a statement or a clear affirmative action. When a particular Member’s Member Token and OAuth Access Token expires, you must obtain that Member’s consent again in order to continue to collect and store their data.

6\. Brand Use
-------------

Each party grants to the other a limited right to use its brands to promote or advertise your Application’s integration of the APIs.

**6.1   Brand Features License and Publicity Rights**

Subject to these Terms (including our [Branding Guidelines](https://brand.linkedin.com/)), we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-sublicenseable, and non-transferable license during the Duration to display Our Brand Features within the Application and to accurately promote or advertise your integration of the APIs in your Application. “**Our** **Brand Features**” means any trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos and domain names that LinkedIn makes available to you. 

You agree not to display Our Brand Features (a) in any way that violates applicable law, including laws regarding libel, slander, obscenity and infringement or (b) in any way that is misleading, implies that your Application is approved, created or endorsed by LinkedIn (or otherwise embellishing your relationship with LinkedIn) or in a way that is otherwise objectionable to LinkedIn in its sole discretion. If you are planning any formal, proactive press outreach, you will submit the content (press release, blog post, etc.) to us for prior written approval (email acceptable), unless expressly allowed in our [Branding Guidelines](https://brand.linkedin.com/). Any good will in Our Brand Features resulting from your use will inure solely to LinkedIn.

You grant us a limited, non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-sublicensable, and non-transferable license during the Duration to display your trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos and domain names (collectively, “**Your Brand Features**”) to promote or advertise your use of the APIs in your Application.  Any good will in Your Brand Features resulting from our use will inure solely to you. 

We may, without your consent, publicly refer to you, orally or in writing, as a licensee of the APIs and/or user of the Content. We may also publish your name and logo (with or without a link to your Application) on our Services, in press releases, and in promotional materials without additional consent or notice to you.

7\. Safety and Abuse
--------------------

Your systems must be configured to securely operate your Application and store Content.

You will complete LinkedIn’s security questionnaire upon request.

You must notify LinkedIn of any security incident that may affect LinkedIn or its Members and you will work with LinkedIn to remediate any security incident.

**7.1   Security Measures**

**a.**    **Requirement for Security Measures.** Your network, operating system and the software of your web servers, databases, and computer systems (collectively, “**Systems**”) must be properly configured to securely operate your Application and process Content.

**b.**    **Security Questionnaire.** If requested, you must complete LinkedIn’s security questionnaire (which LinkedIn will provide to you).

**c.**    **Security Breach.** You must promptly report any security deficiencies in, or intrusions to, your Systems that you discover (or are reported publicly or to you) to LinkedIn in writing via email to [security@linkedin.com](mailto:security@linkedin.com) or subsequent contact information posted on the Developer Site if such intrusions could reasonably be expected to affect the Content, LinkedIn or its Members in any way. You will work with LinkedIn to immediately correct any security deficiency, and will immediately disconnect any intrusions or intruders. In the event of any security deficiency or intrusion involving the Application, APIs or Content, you will make no public statements (e.g., press, blogs, social media, bulletin boards, etc.) without prior written and express permission from LinkedIn in each instance.

We may restrict access to the APIs or perform an audit of your Application if you fail to provide adequate information and materials (including up to two full-featured instances of your Application) to verify your compliance with these Terms.

LinkedIn may monitor any API activity from its own systems.

**7.2   Monitoring**

You will provide us with up to two full-feature client account-level instances to access your Application (and/or other materials relating to your use of the APIs and/or the Content) as reasonably requested by us to verify your compliance with these Terms (including, in particular, your security and privacy obligations under these Terms).  

You also agree to assist LinkedIn in verifying your compliance with these Terms by providing us with information about your Application and storage of Content, which may include access to your Application and other materials or Systems related to your use of the APIs. If you do not demonstrate full compliance with these Terms, as determined in our sole discretion, we may restrict or terminate your access to the APIs.

You acknowledge that LinkedIn may monitor any API activity from its own systems for the purpose of ensuring quality, improving LinkedIn products and Services, and ensuring compliance with these Terms. You must not interfere or attempt to interfere with such monitoring or otherwise obscure from LinkedIn your API activity. LinkedIn may use any technical means to overcome such interference.

8\. Rights LinkedIn Reserves
----------------------------

Although we make reasonable efforts to support the APIs, we have no obligation to do so.  We have no obligation to provide any training or support to your customers.

If we change any of the APIs in the future, your continued use implies that you agree to any changes made.

**8.1   Support and Updates**

We may provide you with support for the APIs in our sole discretion and we may stop providing support to you at any time without notice or liability to you.  We are not obliged to provide any training, support or technical assistance for the Application, the Content, or the APIs directly to your Application users and you agree to communicate to your Application users that you (and not LinkedIn) are responsible for any such support. 

We may modify or release subsequent versions of the APIs and require that you use those subsequent versions.  Unless we release a new version of the APIs for security or legal reasons, you will have a reasonable amount of notice (as determined by us), to migrate to subsequent versions of the APIs.  You acknowledge that once LinkedIn releases a subsequent version of an API, the prior version of such API may stop working at any time or may no longer work in the same manner. Your continued use of the APIs following a subsequent release will be deemed your acceptance of modifications.

LinkedIn currently does not charge a fee for use of the APIs, but may choose to in the future.

Each party bears its own costs in conjunction with the Terms.

You may not charge your users incremental fees for access to our Content or APIs.

**8.2   Costs and Fees**

The APIs are currently provided for free, but LinkedIn reserves the right to charge for the APIs in the future. If we do charge a fee for use of the APIs or any developer tools and features, you do not have any obligation to continue to use the APIs. 

Each party will bear its own costs and expenses in performing its obligations under these Terms. 

You may not charge your Application users incremental fees for access to our Content or APIs.

These Terms do not prevent either party from developing something similar to the other’s applications or services.

**8.3   Independent Development**

Each party acknowledges that the other party may be independently creating applications, content and other products or services that may be similar to or competitive with those of the other party and nothing in these Terms will be construed as restricting or preventing each party from creating and fully exploiting such applications, content and other items, without any obligations to the other party.

9\. Ownership
-------------

We own the APIs, Content, Services and brand

You own your Application and brand.

**9.1   All Rights Reserved**

As between the parties, we own all rights, title, and interest in and to the (a) APIs, and all elements, components, and executables of the APIs, (b) Content; (c) Services; and (d) Our Brand Features (clauses (a)-(d) collectively, the “**LinkedIn Materials**”), and, subject to the foregoing, you own all rights, title, and interest in and to the Application and Your Brand Features. Except to the limited extent expressly provided in these Terms, neither party grants, nor shall the other party acquire, any right, title or interest (including any implied license) in or to any property of the first party under these Terms.  All rights not expressly granted in these Terms are withheld.

You grant LinkedIn a limited license to use your Application during the term of these Terms.

**9.2   License to Your Application**

For the Duration you grant us a paid-up, royalty-free, non-exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable right and license, under all of your intellectual property rights, to: (a) use, perform, and display your Application and its content for purposes of marketing, demonstrating, and answering inquiries; (b) link to and direct Members to your Application; and (c) sublicense the foregoing rights to LinkedIn Affiliates (as defined in Section 12.3 below).

Either party is free to use suggestions or feedback that is provided by the other party.

**9.3   Feedback**

Either party may from time to time elect, in its sole discretion, to provide suggestions, comments, improvements, ideas or other feedback to the other party related to the other party’s products and services (”**Feedback**”). Feedback is provided on an “as is” basis with no warranties of any kind and the receiving party will have a royalty-free, worldwide, sublicenseable, transferable, non-exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable right and license to use Feedback. Each party agrees not to provide Feedback that it knows is subject to any intellectual property claim by a third party or any license terms which would require products or services derived from that Feedback to be licensed to or from, or shared with, any third party.

10\. Follow the Law and These Terms
-----------------------------------
