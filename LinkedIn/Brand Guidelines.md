Logo for Use by LinkedIn Members  
  
**The only use of LinkedIn brand features that is permitted without a separate agreement is that if you are  a LinkedIn member, you may use the “in” Logo to designate a link to your personal profile or to a Group or Company page or to promote you or your organization’s presence on LinkedIn.  

You may use words in connection with the “in” Logo to indicate the link to your profile, company or group, provided that: (i) the words displayed next to the “in” Logo are in a different font and color (in comparison to the “in” Logo), and preferably in black; and (ii) the clear space rules set forth in the Use Requirements and Terms are followed. Examples of such use are as follows:

### IX.

### Use requirements and terms

  
All permitted uses of the LinkedIn Marks must conform to the following guidelines:  
  
**Logo Display:** The LinkedIn logo must stand alone. You must maintain a minimum amount of space between the LinkedIn logo and other graphic or textual elements. To preserve the integrity and clarity of the logo, a standard area of “clear space” should be maintained around the logo in all uses. The minimum clear space is defined as “2x” where “x” is measured by the width of the type stroke of the letter “I” in the logo.

Required clear space for the LinkedIn logo  
  
**Logo and Background Color:** The LinkedIn logo should always be used in color for online use. The LinkedIn logo should also be used in color for print applications unless the color version is not practical, in which case the logo can be reproduced in solid black. The preferred background color for the logo is solid white. When a solid white color is not practical, it may be used on a solid, light background color. The high resolution logo must be used for all print applications. High resolution logos can be [downloaded here](https://brand.linkedin.com/downloads). If you are a member of the media and have any specific requirements, please contact us at [TrademarkRequest@linkedin.com](mailto:TrademarkRequest@linkedin.com).  
  
**Logo Size:** The LinkedIn logos may be provided in different sizes/resolutions in transparent PNG format. To ensure the logo resolution and quality are not degraded, these logos may not be enlarged beyond their native/maximum size. [Vector EPS logos](https://brand.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/brand/en-us/brand-home/downloads/LinkedIn-Logos-Vector-EPS.zip) may be enlarged beyond their native size. The minimum size is 21px tall on screen, or 0.25” tall (6.35mm) in print applications, measured by the height of the “in” box.  
  
**No Modification:** The LinkedIn Marks must be used as provided by LinkedIn with no modifications. Don’t remove, distort or alter any element of the Marks, including changing any colors. Do not shorten, abbreviate, or create acronyms out of the Marks.  
  
**No Confusingly Similar Marks:** Don’t use the Marks in a manner that might create potential confusion as to the owner of the LinkedIn Marks or imply that LinkedIn is the source of your products or services.  
  
**No Incorporation:** Don’t incorporate the LinkedIn Marks into your own product name, service names, trademarks, logos, company names, domain names, website title, publication title, application icon, favicon, or the like. Don’t incorporate or use the IN logo as part of a word.  
  
**No Generic Use:** Don’t use the LinkedIn Marks in a way that suggests a common, descriptive, or generic meaning.  
  
**No Plural or Possessive Use:** Never use the LinkedIn Marks in the plural or possessive form.  
  
**Domain Names:** Don’t register the LinkedIn Marks as domain names or as any part of a domain name.  
  
**Trade Dress:** Don’t copy or imitate LinkedIn’s website design, typefaces, distinctive color, graphics designs or imagery.  
  
**Endorsement:** Don’t display the LinkedIn Marks in any manner that might imply a relationship or affiliation with, sponsorship, or endorsement by LinkedIn, or that can be reasonably interpreted to suggest that any content has been authorized by or represents the views or opinions of LinkedIn or LinkedIn personnel.  
  
**Prominence:** Don’t display the LinkedIn Marks as the primary or most prominent feature on your web page or in any non-LinkedIn materials.  
  
**Disparagement:** Do not use the LinkedIn Marks in a manner that would disparage LinkedIn Corporation or its products or services.  
  
**Violation of Law:** Don’t display the LinkedIn Marks on any web site that contains or displays adult content, promotes gambling, involves the sale of tobacco or alcohol to persons under twenty-one years of age, or otherwise violates any law or regulation.  
  
**Objectionable Use:** Don’t display the LinkedIn Marks in a manner that is in LinkedIn’s sole opinion misleading, unfair, defamatory, infringing, libelous, disparaging, obscene or otherwise objectionable to LinkedIn.  
  
**Attribution:** The LinkedIn Marks must be accompanied by the appropriate ® or ™ symbol. If you use the Marks outside the United States, please see Use Outside the US below.  
  
**Use Outside the US:** Trademark rights vary from country to country. Some countries have penalties for improper use of the registration symbol ®. If using the Marks on sites based outside the United States, use the ™ symbol unless otherwise noted in these Guidelines.  
  
**Termination:** LinkedIn may ask you to stop using the Marks at any time. You agree to stop using the Marks within a reasonable period of LinkedIn’s request, but in no situation, more than seven (7) days after LinkedIn’s request.  
  
**Reservation of Rights:** LinkedIn is the owner of all rights in the Marks and reserves all rights save the limited license granted here. Your use of the Marks pursuant to this license shall not be construed as limiting any of LinkedIn’s rights in the Marks.  
  
LINKEDIN DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES THAT MAY BE EXPRESS OR IMPLIED BY LAW REGARDING THE LINKEDIN MARKS (TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW), INCLUDING WARRANTIES AGAINST INFRINGEMENT.
