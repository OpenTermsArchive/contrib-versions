The following Service Terms apply to Customer to the extent the specific Service is included in the applicable ordering document. LinkedIn may update these Service Terms from time to time. LinkedIn reserves the right to upgrade, update or discontinue any aspect or feature of a Service in whole or in part; provided, however, that if LinkedIn discontinues a Service in whole during the term of an ordering document, then LinkedIn will provide Customer with an alternative or replacement service.

Customer will use the Recruiter Corporate Service (and related services) and information about Members only to recruit individuals to become employees and consultants of Customer or its Affiliates, or, if Customer is acting as a Staffing Agency or BPO, only to recruit individuals to become employees and consultants of its clients.

Staffing Agency purchases of Recruiter Corporate seats are governed by the master subscription agreement between LinkedIn and Staffing Agency. BPO purchases of Recruiter Corporate seats are governed by the master subscription agreement between LinkedIn and the BPO's client. Customer’s breach of this Section will be deemed a material breach of the Agreement.

**1.2. Recruiter Professional**

All capitalized terms in this section shall have the meaning assigned to them in these Service Terms and/or the LSA. Customer will use the Recruiter Professional Service and related services (“**RPS**”) and information about Members only to (i) recruit individuals to become employees and consultants of its clients and (ii) for Customer’s internal recruitment purposes, provided that only Staffing Agencies may use RPS. Customer will not, and will not permit Customers Users to, use RPS to recruit on behalf of a client using the client's name and/or logo, including (without limitation) through the use of the client’s name and/or logo in Customer Users’ LinkedIn.com profiles, Job Postings and/or LinkedIn InMails.

Customer’s breach of this Section will be deemed a material breach of the Agreement.

**1.5. Job Postings and Job Slots**

All Postings must comply with the [LinkedIn Jobs Policies](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/l/jobs-policies) as well as all applicable laws. We periodically update our policies; Customer acknowledges and agrees that LinkedIn may update and change its policies at any time without notice. Job Postings and Job Slots Services (collectively, “**Jobs Services**”) are designed to help Customer reach quality candidates for job opportunities. Job Postings posted under available Job Slots will expire upon the expiration/termination of the ordering document. The Jobs Services allow Customer's postings to be served on properties (e.g., websites and mobile applications) of LinkedIn and enabled third parties. Customer is responsible for (i) all postings and content through the Jobs Services or otherwise to LinkedIn, including but not limited to the job descriptions, creatives, trademarks, images, URLs and pixels that comprise the postings or content therefor (collectively, “**Postings**”); and (ii) all content and property to which Postings may direct viewers, as well as redirects (“**Destinations**”). Customer may not resell or transfer access to the Jobs Services to any other party. Each Posting must be for 1 job opportunity; it is not permitted for a Posting to solicit applications for more than one position. Customer will not copy, duplicate, replicate, scrape or otherwise reproduce jobs from a hiring company’s website and upload them to LinkedIn as Postings without the hiring company’s prior knowledge and authorization. Where a hiring company informs LinkedIn that Customer has done so without its prior knowledge and authorization, LinkedIn reserves the right to remove such Postings immediately and without prior notice to Customer. In order to post a job for a position at a third-party entity, Customer must have an active contract in place with the third-party entity providing active recruiting services beyond job posting for the applicable position. To resolve disputes and ensure compliance with our policies, LinkedIn may request additional information to verify the contractual relationship and permission to post jobs for third parties. Customer agrees that it will not, and will not enable or authorize any third party, by virtue of the Postings, Destinations, or use of the Jobs Services, to:

·        Provide identifiable candidate resume or application data to any other parties (except for Customer’s service providers (such as an applicant tracking system);

·        “**Spam**” or otherwise contact applicants for purposes other than related to the specific employment opportunity described in the posting;

·        Harass, stalk, or contact any applicant after they have asked not to be contacted;

·        Except as expressly authorized by LinkedIn in writing, use any automated means or form of scraping or data extraction to access, modify, download, query or otherwise collect information from LinkedIn’s websites; or

**1.7. Talent Hub**

Talent Hub is a hiring platform that enables customers to source, manage, and hire candidates in one place.

Talent Hub will be used to manage candidates through the recruiting workflow ultimately helping companies collaborate on jobs and candidates and hire in the same platform they use to source candidates. LinkedIn will use Talent Hub Data to provide, support, and improve LinkedIn’s Services , including to provide Talent Hub Data in the aggregate to surface insights and benchmarking to help companies have better insight into their process relative to their peers. Customer is solely responsible for the implementation of Talent Hub, including (i) migrating any candidate data from Customer’s third-party applicant tracking system to Talent Hub; (ii) providing the candidate data in a format that is acceptable to LinkedIn and compatible with Talent Hub; and (iii) ensuring it has all necessary consents to provide the candidate data to LinkedIn (collectively, “**Implementation**”). LinkedIn disclaims any and all liability in connection with the Implementation.

**2\. SALES SERVICES**

**2.1. Sales Navigator**

Customer will have access to Sales Navigator [value-add services](https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/business/sales-solutions/global/en_US/site/pdf/ti/services.pdf) for the Term of the ordering document. No refund or credit will be provided if the value-add services are not used during the Term of the ordering document.

**3\. LEARNING SERVICES**

**3.1. LinkedIn Learning**

Customer will have access to the content on the LinkedIn.com platform only. Customer Users may only view the content online via the LinkedIn.com platform or by downloading the content for offline viewing via the LinkedIn Learning mobile app. Customer may not violate the intellectual property or other rights of LinkedIn, including, without limitation, (i) copying or distributing our learning videos or other materials or (ii) using the word “**LinkedIn**” or our logos in any business name, email, or URL except as provided in the [Brand Guidelines](https://brand.linkedin.com/policies). Unless agreed to otherwise by the parties on the applicable ordering document, a Customer User must be a then current employee, contractor, student or library patron depending upon the LinkedIn Learning service purchased by Customer. For the LinkedIn Learning service, the User Agreement will apply if Customer connects its LinkedIn Learning dashboard to its Customer Users' LinkedIn.com profiles. Customer User must be at least 16 years of age. Customer will designate a single master administrator (“**Master Admin**”). The Master Admin will have access to the reporting and management tools and will be able to establish full administrators and sub administrators with limited rights and access. Except as set forth below, Customer may only display or perform the content in a public setting, including a conference room or classroom, if Customer has purchased seats for all Customer Users. Customer retains sole responsibility for all content (including third-party content) uploaded or provided by Customer through our Services and will monitor, review, and remove such content. All content Customer uploads or provides through our Services must be owned or licensed to Customer. Only Customer will have access to such content. One LinkedIn Learning seat = One Customer User, and each seat is deemed used/active when a Customer User registers to access the content service. Each Customer User must have a unique identifier for a login, such as a unique email address or IP address. Aliases are not permitted. During each 12-month term of an ordering document, Customer may reassign 10 seats or 25% of the total number of seats purchased, whichever is greater. For LinkedIn Learning Campus, the number of seat reassignments is equal to 10 seats or 35% of the total number of seats purchased, whichever is greater. During the term of a LinkedIn Campus ordering document, should the Campus Customer exceed the total FTE count listed on the ordering document Customer may increase the FTE count with an executed, zero-dollar add-on ordering document. The add-on seats will co-term with the original order form. If the original ordering document is for a Partial Campus (a specific department on Campus) the additional zero-dollar seats requested must be used for said specific department only. LinkedIn Campus FTE quantities listed on the initial invoice represent the starting quantities that will be provisioned by LinkedIn.

**3.1.1. LinkedIn Learning for Library**

For each LinkedIn Learning for Library seat purchased by Customer, any Customer User who has a valid Customer’s library card, or pin/password, may access the LinkedIn Learning content via LinkedIn Learning for Library during the term of the order. The LinkedIn User Agreement will not apply to LinkedIn Learning for Library Customer Users. A Customer User is an individual designated by Customer that has (1) registered, received and maintains an active Customer library card/Customer Account and (2) who resides (maintains a valid address) in Customer’s geographical service location. Customer must verify that the individual resides in the Customer’s geographical service location. A Customer User may be a staff member even if the staff member does not reside in Customer’s geographical service location. Customer may only market the LinkedIn Learning for Library service to individual patrons of the Library. Customer or any government entity related to or associated with Customer will not market to any other groups, including but not limited to, any business, corporation, school district, school (including higher education such as universities or colleges), non-profits, and government agencies. Customer’s breach of the foregoing sentence will be considered a material breach of the Agreement. If LinkedIn determines that Customer or any other entity is marketing LinkedIn Learning for Library without permission, LinkedIn will terminate Customer’s order. Customer will not be able to establish sub administrators, upload content, reassign seats, or display or perform the content in a public setting, including a conference room or classroom.

**7.3.2.** For transfers of EU Personal Data to Glint for processing by Glint in a jurisdiction other than a jurisdiction in the EU, the EEA, or the European Commission-approved countries providing ‘adequate’ data protection, each party agrees it will use Module 2 of the SCCs for Controller to Processor transfers, which are incorporated herein by reference.

Customer agrees that on the termination of the Services, Glint shall at no cost, and shall cause any subprocessors to, at the choice of Customer, unless applicable law prevents Glint from returning or destroying all or part of the data disclosed: (a) return to Customer all the Customer personal data, including survey responses if the User Confidentiality Notice disclosed Customer would receive responses identified to individuals or (b) securely destroy them and demonstrate to the satisfaction of Customer that it has taken such measures or (c) export Customer personal data in a non-aggregated form to Customer’s new service provider under a separate written agreement reasonably satisfactory to Glint under which Customer and the recipient of the data accept responsibility and liability for the data subsequent to transfer or export.
