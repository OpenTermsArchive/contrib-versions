#### **5.1. General**

Customer authorizes LinkedIn to place advertisements ("Talent Media") containing artwork, copy, active URLs, and other advertising material and technology provided by Customer (“Advertising Materials”) on LinkedIn websites and/or third-party network websites, subject to Customer electing to enable or disable the delivery of Talent Media on third-party network websites [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/83628](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/83628)) (collectively, the “Site”).

Customer will obtain all necessary rights, consents, licenses and clearances for LinkedIn to include the Advertising Materials in Talent Media.

LinkedIn will use all Talent Media in compliance with this Agreement and any written instructions provided on the ordering document. LinkedIn’s measurements are the definitive measurements for calculating fees. Third party impression tracking is unavailable for Talent Media. LinkedIn and its Affiliates may participate in ad placing auctions to promote its own services or otherwise communicate to its users. LinkedIn makes no guarantees as to (a) the results or distribution of any Talent Media in any manner; or (b) any number of sends, impressions, opens or clicks.

#### **5.2. Recruitment Ads, Sponsored Jobs and Sponsored Updates**

Recruitment Ads, Sponsored Jobs and Sponsored Updates are Talent Media sold under an auction model.

For example, if the winning advertiser has a bid of ten ($10) dollars cost-per-click, but the next highest bid is seven ($7) dollars, the winning advertiser only pays $7.01. The second price method allows each advertiser to bid the absolute maximum they are willing to pay for the Talent Media. LinkedIn will charge enough to enable the highest price to be paid to win the auction. 

#### **5.3. Work With Us Ads**

Work With Us Ads will launch within 3 days from the Start Date in the ordering document using a default ad unit configured by LinkedIn, unless otherwise agreed in writing by LinkedIn.

LinkedIn can only identify Members who have selected a company name from the pre-existing list.

#### **7.3. Usage, Aggregation and Transfer of Data**

Except as provided in these Service Terms or as otherwise agreed in writing by the parties, raw survey responses identifying individual survey respondents and Personal Data (as defined in Section 1 of the DPA) associated with individual survey respondents (“Identifiable Data”) will not be provided to Customer. Customer will not attempt to discern Identifiable Data. Customer shall provide appropriate notices to Customer Users about, and if required by applicable law or regulation, obtain appropriate consent or other appropriate legal basis from Customer Users for: (i) the collection, transfer and processing of Customer data through the Services and (ii) Customer’s use of any service providers or other third-parties that Customer instructs Glint to send data to or receive data from Glint. Customer represents that it will not process Sensitive Data through the Services. Customer may allow its Affiliates to access and use the Services if Customer is fully liable for its Affiliates’ use of the Services and compliance with the Agreement (with each Affiliate also a “Customer”). Glint will use the Glint subprocessors listed at [https://legal.linkedin.com/customer-subprocessors](https://legal.linkedin.com/customer-subprocessors), which list is updated from time to time. Glint shall be responsible and liable to Customer for the acts and omissions of its subprocessors or other subcontractors in connection with providing the Services. 

7.3.1 For transfers of European Personal Data to Glint for processing by Glint in a jurisdiction other than a jurisdiction in the EU, the EEA, or the European Commission-approved countries providing ‘adequate’ data protection, Glint agrees it will provide at least the same level of privacy protection for European Personal Data as required under Module 2 of the Controller-to-Processor SCCs. If data transfers rely on Controller-to-Processor SCCs to enable the lawful transfer of European Personal Data, as set forth in the preceding sentence, the parties agree that data subjects for whom Glint processes European Personal Data are third-party beneficiaries under the Controller-to-Processor SCCs. If Glint is unable or becomes unable to comply with these requirements, then European Personal Data will be processed and used exclusively within the territory of a member state of the European Union and any movement of European Personal Data to a non-EU country requires the prior written consent of Customer.  

#### **7.4. Survey Email and Identifiable Data** 

Customer will draft the survey email, including any confidentiality notice to each Customer User (“User Confidentiality Notice”) and provide to Glint within three (3) days prior to use in the survey. Customer may use one of Glint’s standard survey email templates. Glint will only provide Identifiable Data (i.e. non-aggregated data) (i) to Customer, if the User Confidentiality Notice discloses that some of Customer’s personnel will receive survey responses directly identified to individual survey respondents and (ii) to a Customer-designated supplier, if the supplier agrees to protect the data consistent with the terms of the Agreement. Customer agrees that it will not modify or delete any portion of the User Confidentiality Notice or in any other communication with Customer User that imposes any obligation on Glint. If the User Confidentiality Notice advised data subjects that Customer would receive the survey data in a non-aggregated form, Glint will provide Customer with the survey data outside of the Service’s platform in a CSV format so that Customer can perform separate analysis and/or protect against data loss at an additional for each instance a survey is sent to a group.  

#### **7.5. Data Return**

Customer agrees that on the termination of the Services, Glint shall at no cost, and shall cause any subprocessors to, at the choice of Customer, unless applicable law prevents Glint from returning or destroying all or part of the data disclosed: (a) return to Customer all the Customer personal data, including survey responses if the User Confidentiality Notice disclosed Customer would receive responses identified to individuals or (b) securely destroy them and demonstrate to the satisfaction of Customer that it has taken such measures or (c) export Customer personal data in a non-aggregated form to Customer’s new service provider under a separate written agreement reasonably satisfactory to Glint under which Customer and the recipient of the data accept responsibility and liability for the data subsequent to transfer or export. Glint uses de-identified, aggregated data generated from its Services to provide statistical benchmarks across industries and improve its Services.
