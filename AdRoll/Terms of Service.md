3.  Promotions; Credits. NextRoll may offer Customer certain promotions, discounts, general credits, ad or media credits or other special offers that will be reflected in Customer’s Order Form or Insertion Order.  There will be no refunds or credits for partial terms, downgrades, or unused credits or features.
    
4.  Overage Fees. If Customer exceeds any usage limits specified in the Order Form, Insertion Order, Account or Documentation, or Customer Sites exceed the number of monthly unique visitors (MUVs) established for select Services (where Fees are based on MUVs), NextRoll reserves the right to upgrade Customer to the next tier Package or pricing corresponding with Customer’s usage or eligibility for the remainder of the Term, or bill Customer for the Fees associated with the overage, in each case using the billing information associated with the Account.
    
5.  Changes in Fees. NextRoll reserves the right to change its Fees and to institute new charges at the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term (or for Customers using Media Services only, at any time with notice to Customer). Customer’s use of the Services following any such notification constitutes its acceptance of new or increased Fees.
    

**5.2 Payment Terms.**  Unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing, payment terms will be specified in the Order Form or Insertion Order and billed as follows:

1.  Packages. All Packages (excluding any “Free” Packages or promotions) are billed in advance and are non-refundable. Packages will automatically renew for successive Terms of the same duration (_e.g_., a 12-month Package will automatically renew for another 12-months, a monthly Package will renew for another month), and Customer will be charged the applicable Fees on each anniversary of purchase, unless canceled or downgraded in accordance with Section 11.2 or 11.3.

    1.  Auto Post-Pay Accounts. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing, Fees for Media Services will be automatically billed in arrears on a weekly basis.
        
    2.  Auto-Prepay Accounts.

Customer authorizes NextRoll to charge such amounts using the valid payment details provided by Customer.  Customer understands that all funds transferred to NextRoll become the property of NextRoll upon transfer to compensate NextRoll for costs involved in delivering the Services, including creating and maintaining, and providing access to the Documentation, Technology, and Performance Reports.  If Customer suspends a campaign or Services, cancels the Account, or terminates this Agreement, it may request reimbursement in the amount of the prepaid funds not attributed to any completed campaign(s) within 180 days after the campaign or Services are paused, the Account is canceled or this Agreement is terminated; provided that any such reimbursement is at NextRoll’s sole discretion.

Customer is responsible for all sales, use, value added, withholding, and any other similar taxes imposed by federal, state, local, or foreign governmental entities on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (“**Taxes**”), excluding taxes based solely upon NextRoll’s net income, even if NextRoll did not collect and remit such Taxes on Customer’s behalf. If NextRoll is assessed fines, penalties or payments for non-payment of Taxes, then NextRoll will be entitled to full reimbursement of such amounts by Customer.

**5.4 Non-Payment; Late Payment.**  

1.  Suspension or Termination. NextRoll may suspend or terminate Customer and its Authorized Users’ access to the Services for failure to pay any Fees within the time frame specified in the Order Form or Insertion Order.

2.  Interest. Without limiting NextRoll’s remedies, NextRoll may charge interest on overdue Fees from the due date up to the date of actual payment at a monthly rate of 1.5% or the highest rate permitted by Applicable Law, whichever is less. Customer will reimburse NextRoll for expenses and recovery costs incurred in collecting any past due Fees, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of collection.
    
3.  Set-Off. NextRoll may set off any liability owed to Customer against any liability for which NextRoll reasonably determines Customer is liable to NextRoll, related to Services under this Agreement.
    
4.  Credit Risk. If Customer develops credit conditions (e.g., excessive credit card denials, chargebacks, return-to-maker payments due to insufficient funds, declaration of insolvency or bankruptcy) or NextRoll otherwise designates Customer as a credit risk, NextRoll reserves the right to modify Customer’s payment terms. If an Agency or Authorized Reseller (but not its Client) enters into or is the subject of an insolvency, receivership or bankruptcy proceeding or any other proceeding for the settlement of Customer’s debts, NextRoll shall have the right to notify relevant Clients directly in effort to settle outstanding liabilities under this Agreement.

| ### 12\. CONFIDENTIALITY | [Back to top](#terms-index) |

Confidential Information includes all information disclosed by a party (the “**Disclosing Party**”) to the other party (the “**Receiving Party**”), whether of a technical, business, or other nature that the Receiving Party knows or has reason to know is the confidential, proprietary or trade secret information of the Disclosing Party. Confidential Information does not include information that: (a) was lawfully known to the Receiving Party prior to receiving the same from the Disclosing Party in connection with this Agreement; (b) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party; (c) is lawfully acquired by the Receiving Party from another source without restriction as to use; or (d) is or becomes part of the public domain through no act or omission of the Receiving Party.

If a Receiving Party is required by Applicable Law to disclose the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, such Receiving Party must give prompt written notice (except where prohibited by Applicable Law) of such requirement to the Disclosing Party before such disclosure and reasonably assist the Disclosing Party, at Disclosing Party’s cost, in obtaining an order protecting the Confidential Information from public disclosure. The obligations in this Section 12 will survive for three (3) years after the expiration or termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to a Disclosing Party’s trade secrets, the Receiving Party’s obligations under this Agreement remain in effect if the Confidential Information remains a trade secret under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act. NextRoll may disclose the name of Customer and existence of this Agreement as required by Applicable Law, court or regulatory order, audit or investigation.

| ### 13\. RESOLVING DISPUTES | [Back to top](#terms-index) |

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY, AS IT INVOLVES A WAIVER OF CERTAIN RIGHTS TO BRING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING AS A CLASS ACTION FOR RESIDENTS OF THE U.S.

**13.1 Please contact NextRoll first!** NextRoll wants to address Customer's concerns without resorting to formal legal proceedings. Before filing a claim, Customer agrees to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting NextRoll first through support@nextroll.com, or via Customer’s designated Account Manager.

**13.2 Venue for disputes.** Customer and NextRoll agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to this Agreement or the Services will be brought in the federal or state courts located in San Francisco County, California, subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions below. Customer and NextRoll consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts. Notwithstanding the above, Customer and NextRoll agree that Customer alternatively may attend any arbitration proceedings telephonically or videographically, in which case NextRoll will do so as well. 

U.S. RESIDENTS ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER:

**13.3 Arbitration.** 

1.  **Agreement to Arbitrate.** Customer and NextRoll agree to resolve any claims relating to this Agreement or the Services through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below.
    
2.  **Arbitration Procedures.** The American Arbitration Association (“**AAA**”) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. The arbitration will be held in the United States in accordance with the venue specified in Section 13.2.
    
3.  **Arbitration Fees and Incentives.** The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. NextRoll will pay all arbitration fees for Customer on a pre-pay plan where Customer’s claim is for less than $50,000. NextRoll will not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that Customer's claim is frivolous.
    
4.  **Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate.** Either party may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco, California, provided that NextRoll agrees that Customer may choose to appear by video, and if Customer so chooses, then NextRoll shall appear by video as well. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, non-payment of Fees, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above. If this Agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to Customer or Customer's claim, Customer agrees to the exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California to resolve Customer's claim.
    
5.  **Opt Out of Agreement to Arbitrate.** Customer can decline this agreement to arbitrate by sending an email within thirty (30) days of entering into this Agreement to: arbitration\_optout@nextroll.com clearly stating that Customer wishes to opt out of arbitration with NextRoll and include Customer's name, and the name and email address associated with the Account.
    

**13.4 Class Action Waiver.** Both parties agree to resolve any disputes, claims, or controversies on an individual basis, and that any claims arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement (such as with respect to their validity or enforceability), the NextRoll Materials, or the Services provided by NextRoll, will be brought in an individual capacity, and not on behalf of, or as part of, any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding.
