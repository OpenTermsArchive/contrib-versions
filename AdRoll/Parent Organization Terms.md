**5.1 Fees.**  Customer shall pay the following fees (“**Fees**”):

*   Fees for Packages. Fees for Packages will be set forth in Customer’s Order Form or Insertion Order.  
*   Fees for Media Services, Add-Ons and API Media Integrations. Fees for Media Services, “add-ons” and certain API Media Integrations are in addition to the Fees for Packages, and additional payment terms may be set forth in the Order Form or Insertion Order. 
*   Promotions; Credits. NextRoll may offer Customer certain promotions, discounts, general credits, media credits or other special offers which will be reflected in Customer’s Order Form or Insertion Order.  There will be no refunds or credits for partial terms, downgrades, or unused credits or features.
*   Overage Fees. If Customer exceeds any usage limits specified in the Order Form, Insertion Order, Account or Documentation, NextRoll reserves the right to upgrade Customer to the next tier Package corresponding with Customer’s usage for the remainder of the Term, or bill Customer for the Fees associated with the overage, in each case using the billing information associated with the Account.
*   Changes in Fees. NextRoll reserves the right to change its Fees and to institute new charges at the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term (or for Customers using Media Services only, at any time with notice to Customer). Customer’s use of the Services following any such notification constitutes its acceptance of new or increased Fees.

**5.2 Payment Terms.**  Unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing, payment terms will be specified in the Order Form or Insertion Order and billed as follows:

*   Packages. All Packages (excluding any “Free” Packages) are billed in advance and are non-refundable. Packages will automatically renew for successive Terms of the same duration (_e.g_., a 12-month Package will automatically renew for another 12-months, a monthly Package will renew for another month), and Customer will be charged the applicable Fees on each anniversary of purchase, unless canceled or downgraded in accordance with Section 11.2 or 11.3.
*   Media Services. Media Services may be included as part of a Package or purchased as stand-alone Services. 

*   Auto Post-Pay Accounts. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing, Fees for Media Services will be automatically billed in arrears on a weekly basis.  
*   Auto-Prepay Accounts. For auto-prepay Accounts, Customer agrees to keep valid payment method information (for example, credit card or PayPal account information) on file in the Account always, and NextRoll will pre-charge Customer weekly for each campaign budget amount as determined by Customer in the Account. Customer authorizes NextRoll to charge such amounts using the valid payment details provided by Customer.  Customer understands that all funds transferred to NextRoll become the property of NextRoll upon transfer to compensate NextRoll for costs involved in delivering the Services, including creating and maintaining, and providing access to the Documentation, Technology, and Performance Reports.  If Customer suspends a campaign or Services, cancels the Account, or terminates this Agreement, it may request reimbursement in the amount of the prepaid funds not attributed to any completed campaign(s) within 180 days after the campaign or Services are paused, the Account is canceled or this Agreement is terminated; provided that any such reimbursement is at NextRoll’s sole discretion.

**5.3 Taxes.** Fees are quoted exclusive of any Taxes (defined below). Customer is responsible for all sales, use, value added, withholding, and any other similar taxes imposed by federal, state, local, or foreign governmental entities on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (“**Taxes**”), excluding taxes based solely upon NextRoll’s net income, even if NextRoll did not collect and remit such Taxes on Customer’s behalf. If NextRoll is assessed fines, penalties or payments for non-payment of Taxes, then NextRoll will be entitled to full reimbursement of such amounts by Customer.

**5.4 Non-Payment; Late Payment.**

*   Suspension or Termination. NextRoll may suspend or terminate Customer and its Authorized Users’ access to the Services for failure to pay any Fees within the time frame specified in the Order Form or Insertion Order. Termination or suspension will not relieve Customer of its obligation to pay Fees pursuant to this Agreement. NextRoll reserves the right to downgrade Customer to a lower Package. 
*   Interest. Without limiting NextRoll’s remedies, NextRoll may charge interest on overdue Fees from the due date up to the date of actual payment at a monthly rate of 1.5% or the highest rate permitted by Applicable Law, whichever is less. Customer will reimburse NextRoll for expenses and recovery costs incurred in collecting any past due Fees, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of collection.
*   Set-Off. NextRoll may set off any liability owed to Customer against any liability for which NextRoll reasonably determines Customer is liable to NextRoll, related to Services under this Agreement. 
*   Credit Risk. If Customer develops credit conditions (e.g., excessive credit card denials, chargebacks, return-to-maker payments due to insufficient funds, declaration of insolvency or bankruptcy) or NextRoll otherwise designates Customer as a credit risk, NextRoll reserves the right to modify Customer’s payment terms. If an Agency or Authorized Reseller (but not its Client) enters into or is the subject of an insolvency, receivership or bankruptcy proceeding or any other proceeding for the settlement of Customer’s debts, NextRoll shall have the right to notify relevant Clients directly in effort to settle outstanding liabilities under this Agreement. 

**5.5 Billing Disputes.** Any claims or disputes relating to Fees under this Agreement must be sent to NextRoll in writing within thirty (30) days of the billing date or will be waived by Customer.

If NextRoll reasonably believes that the Services or NextRoll Materials could become subject to a third party claim of infringement, NextRoll may in its sole discretion: (i) modify the Services of NextRoll Materials so that it no longer infringes or misappropriates; (ii) obtain a license for Customer’s continued use of the affected Services or NextRoll Materials in accordance with this Agreement, or (iii) terminate the affected Services or this Agreement upon 30 days’ prior written notice and provide a refund of any pre-paid fees applicable to any period following the effective date of termination. NextRoll’s indemnification obligations in this Section 9.2 will be NextRoll’s sole liability and Customer’s sole remedy for any claims that the Services or NextRoll Materials violate, infringe, or misappropriate any third-party intellectual property rights.

**9.3 Indemnification Process.** The indemnified party will promptly notify the indemnifying party of the claim and cooperate with the indemnifying party in defending the claim. The indemnifying party will have full control and authority over the defense, except that: (a) any settlement requiring the indemnified party to admit liability or pay any amount (not covered by the indemnifying party) requires prior written consent of the indemnified party, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; and (b) the indemnified party may join in the defense with its own counsel at its own expense.

This Agreement may not otherwise be terminated by Customer prior to the end of the Term.

**11.4 Suspension for Prohibited Acts.** NextRoll may suspend Customer and its Authorized Users’ access to any or all Services, in whole or in part, without notice, if: (a) Customer or its Authorized Users are in material breach of this Agreement; (b) NextRoll receives a claim, complaint, or notice that Customer Content or Customer Sites violate, infringe or misappropriate any third-party rights (e.g., a DMCA notice); or (c) Customer or its Authorized Users use the Services or NextRoll Materials in violation of Applicable Law.

**11.5 NextRoll’s Changes to the Services.** NextRoll reserves the right to change, modify, suspend, or discontinue temporarily or permanently, some or all of the Services, with respect to any or all Customers, at any time without notice. Customer agrees that NextRoll will not be liable to Customer for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the Services, although if Customer has selected a paid Package or other prepaid Services, and NextRoll suspends or discontinues the Services, NextRoll may, in its sole discretion, provide Customer with a credit, refund, discount or other form of consideration. However, if NextRoll terminates, suspends, or discontinues Customer’s Account due to Customer’s breach of this Agreement, then Customer will not be eligible for any such credit, refund, discount or other consideration.

| ### 12\. CONFIDENTIALITY | [Back to top](#terms-index) |

Confidential Information includes all information disclosed by a party (the **"Disclosing Party"**) to the other party (the **"Receiving Party"**), whether of a technical, business, or other nature that the Receiving Party knows or has reason to know is the confidential, proprietary or trade secret information of the Disclosing Party. Confidential Information does not include information that: (a) was lawfully known to the Receiving Party prior to receiving the same from the Disclosing Party in connection with this Agreement; (b) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party; (c) is lawfully acquired by the Receiving Party from another source without restriction as to use; or (d) is or becomes part of the public domain through no act or omission of the Receiving Party. Each Receiving Party will (i) use the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information solely for the purpose for which it is provided and as permitted under this Agreement; (ii) not disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to a third-party unless the third-party must access the Confidential Information to perform in accordance with this Agreement and the third-party has agreed to confidentiality terms no less protective than those set forth in this Section 12; and (iii) maintain the confidentiality of, and protect from unauthorized use and disclosure, the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to the same extent (but using no less than a reasonable degree of care) that it protects its own Confidential Information of a similar nature. If a Receiving Party is required by Applicable Law to disclose the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, such Receiving Party must give prompt written notice (except where prohibited by Applicable Law) of such requirement to the Disclosing Party before such disclosure and reasonably assist the Disclosing Party, at Disclosing Party’s cost, in obtaining an order protecting the Confidential Information from public disclosure. The obligations in this Section 12 will survive termination of this Agreement until the expiration of three (3) years from the date of last disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to a Disclosing Party’s trade secrets, the Receiving Party’s obligations under this Agreement remain in effect if the Confidential Information remains a trade secret under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act. NextRoll may disclose the name of Customer and existence of this Agreement as required by Applicable Law, court or regulatory order, audit or investigation.

| ### 13\. RESOLVING DISPUTES | [Back to top](#terms-index) |

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY, AS IT INVOLVES A WAIVER OF CERTAIN RIGHTS TO BRING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING AS A CLASS ACTION FOR RESIDENTS OF THE U.S.

**13.1 Please contact NextRoll first!** NextRoll wants to address Customer's concerns without resorting to formal legal proceedings. Before filing a claim, Customer agrees to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting NextRoll first through support@nextroll.com, or via Customer’s designated Account Manager.

**13.2 Venue for disputes.** Customer and NextRoll agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to this Agreement or the Services will be brought in the federal or state courts located in San Francisco County, California, subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions below. Customer and NextRoll consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts. Notwithstanding the above, Customer and NextRoll agree that Customer alternatively may attend any arbitration proceedings telephonically or videographically, in which case NextRoll will do so as well.

U.S. RESIDENTS ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER:

**13.3 Arbitration.**

*   **Agreement to Arbitrate.** Customer and NextRoll agree to resolve any claims relating to this Agreement or the Services through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below.
*   **Arbitration Procedures.** The American Arbitration Association (**"AAA"**) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. The arbitration will be held in the United States in accordance with the venue specified in Section 13.2.
*   **Arbitration Fees and Incentives.** The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. NextRoll will pay all arbitration fees for Customer on a pre-pay plan where Customer’s claim is for less than $50,000. NextRoll will not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that Customer's claim is frivolous.
*   **Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate.** Either party may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco, California, provided that NextRoll agrees that Customer may choose to appear by video, and if Customer so chooses, then NextRoll shall appear by video as well. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above. If this Agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to Customer or Customer's claim, Customer agrees to the exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California to resolve Customer's claim.
*   **Opt Out of Agreement to Arbitrate.** Customer can decline this agreement to arbitrate by sending an email within thirty (30) days of entering into this Agreement to: [arbitration\_optout@nextroll.com](mailto:arbitration_optout@nextroll.com) clearly stating that Customer wishes to opt out of arbitration with NextRoll and include Customer's name, and the name and email address associated with the Account.

**13.4 Class Action Waiver.** Both parties agree to resolve any disputes, claims, or controversies on an individual basis, and that any claims arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement (such as with respect to their validity or enforceability), the NextRoll Materials, or the Services provided by NextRoll, will be brought in an individual capacity, and not on behalf of, or as part of, any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding.

**13.5 Controlling Law.** This Agreement is governed by the law of the State of California except for its conflicts of laws principles.

**14.7 Severability.** If any portion of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or enforceability will not affect the other provisions of this Agreement, which will remain in full force and effect, and the invalid or unenforceable portion will be given effect to the greatest extent possible.

**14.8 Waiver.** The failure of a party to require performance of any provision will not affect that party’s right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor will a waiver of any breach or default of this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.

**14.9 Third-Party Website Disclaimer.** Links to third-party websites from the Services do not imply endorsement by NextRoll of any products, services or information presented therein, nor does NextRoll warrant or otherwise guarantee the accuracy of the information contained on them.

**14.10 Order of Precedence.** In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between any of the terms of the following documents, the following order of precedence shall control: (a) Insertion Order; (b) Order Form; (c) relevant Service Addendum; and (d) these Terms of Service.
