Our Services may give you the ability to share certain information with other users or other third parties, such as by scanning your QR code.

**6\. Linked sites and advertisements; embedded video player**

**6.1. Linked sites and advertisements**

The Services may contain links to third-party websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those third-party websites.

We work with third-party providers to offer content, products, services, and various functionalities through our Services.

**7\. How long we retain your personal information**

We retain your personal information for as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required by applicable law.

The criteria we use to determine the applicable retention periods include:

*   The length of time that we have had an ongoing business relationship with you (e.g., for as long as you have an account or subscription with us or keep using our Services);
*   Whether we have a legal obligation pursuant to applicable laws to retain the information (e.g., laws requiring us to keep transaction records for a certain period of time); and/or
*   Whether the information is relevant to enforcing our agreements, resolving disputes, site safety and security, and improving our websites’ functionalities.

**8\. Cookies and tracking technologies**

We use tracking technologies such as cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to record your preferences, track the use of our websites, your interactions with our emails, and measure exposure to our online advertisements.

The cookies used on our websites and applications are divided into four general categories:

*   **Necessary**_:_ cookies that are essential to make our websites usable by enabling basic functions like page navigation, access to secured areas of the website, and whether you have opted-out of certain non-necessary cookies.
*   **Performance**: cookies that help us understand how visitors interact with our websites by collecting and reporting about your device’s interactions.
*   **Functional**: cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation.
*   **Marketing**_:_ used to track devices across websites to display ads that are relevant and engaging to our visitors to show you our ads on third-party websites.

We use third-party analytics services on our websites, including Google Analytics. These analytics service providers use cookies or other tracking technologies to help us analyze how users interact with and use our websites, compile reports about activity on websites, and provide us other services.

We work with third-party companies who also use these technologies to provide advertisements on our websites and other third-party websites. These third parties may use these technologies to collect information about you when you use our websites. They may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services.

Some content, applications, and advertisements on our websites may be served by unaffiliated third parties. We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Notice govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services by non-affiliated third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks, or any other non-affiliated third parties.

  
**9\. How we keep your personal information secure**

We have appropriate technical and operational security measures in place to help ensure that your information is protected against unauthorized or accidental access, use, alteration, or loss. We use encryption technology to protect your personal information when you order products or services from us.

We operate a global business, so your personal information may be processed and stored outside the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Economic Area (EEA). For example, our global customer services teams need to access information about you in order to respond to your queries. We put in place safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses, to protect information that is transferred in this way.

  
**10\. Your choices about how information about you is used and shared**

In many instances, you have choices about the information you provide and how we use that information. These choices are described below. California residents and data subjects in Europe have additional rights as set forth in the sections entitled “**Notice for California residents**” and “**Notice for residents of the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and United Kingdom**” below.

**10.1. Marketing emails**

Note that if you choose to remove cookies, you may remove opt-out cookies that affect your advertising preferences.

Many of the third-party advertisers that place tracking tools on our websites are members of programs that offer you additional choices regarding the use of information about you for advertising. You can learn more about the options available to limit these third parties’ use of your information by visiting the websites for the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) and the [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).

You can choose to block sharing of this data with advertisers. This means that we turn off some types of advertising based on information you have given us and your use of our sites, ensuring that our advertising partners do not receive this data. By opting out, you will stop receiving adverts that are targeted specifically to you; however, you will still see the same number of adverts on our websites.

We do not knowingly sell the personal information of consumers under 16 years of age.

*   Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you.
*   Delete certain information we have about you.
*   Correct inaccurate information we have about you.

You or your authorized agent may submit a request to exercise these rights by using our [Request for Information](https://rfi.coindesk.com/) or [Request for Deletion](https://rfd.coindesk.com/) tool or sending us an email at [\[email protected\]](https://www.coindesk.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).
