This Privacy Policy does not apply to information that you may submit to third-party websites or mobile applications that may link to the Websites or be linked to on the Websites. We are not responsible for the actions or privacy practices of third-party websites and applications; please consult those websites and applications directly to understand their privacy practices.

**Information From Social Media:** When you interact with us or our Websites on a social media platform, we may collect the personal information that you make available to us, including your account ID, username, and other information included in your posts. If you choose to log into your account with or through a social networking service, we and that service may share certain information about you and your activities. When you give us permission, we may also collect information from your social media account on your behalf.

**Information From Other Sources:** We may supplement the information we collect with information offline or from third parties.

**HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM OR ABOUT YOU**

We use the information we collect from or about you to help us personalize and continually improve your experience on the Websites, including providing our services and conferences, responding to requests for information, analyzing and compiling trends and statistics, and communicating with you. For information about how to manage information about you and the choices you have, see the **Your Choices** section below.

We also may use information about you to: provide, maintain, and improve the Websites and for internal or other business purposes; run and administer our virtual and in-personal conferences; fulfill your requests for information; communicate with you; detect, investigate, and prevent activities that may violate our policies or be fraudulent or illegal; optimize, perform analysis, or improve our Websites, products, services, and operations; provide, produce, and ship the products that you order or the services you request; provide customer support; send you offers or other communications about our products and services, such as special or promotional events, including services, products, or events for which we collaborate or co-offer with a third party; administer contests, sweepstakes, promotions, and surveys; and to post user generated content provided by users.

**DESK Program:** If you provide your wallet address as part of our DESK Program, we will not use or otherwise analyze your wallet address for any purpose other than to provide the DESK Program to you. As discussed below, your wallet address may be shared by our DESK Program with our program partners, sponsors, or service providers in order to enable or provide a program benefit that you have earned or redeemed. We contractually prohibit these third parties from using your wallet information for any purpose other than providing such benefits, and we require them to delete the data once the benefit has been provided. Your wallet address shared with the DESK Program will never be used by us for any of our journalistic or news reporting functions.

We may use the information from one portion of the Websites on other portions of the Websites, and we may combine information gathered from multiple portions of the Websites. We also may use or combine information that we collect offline, or that we collect or receive from third-party sources for many reasons, including to enhance, expand, and check the accuracy of our records. Additionally, we may use information collected from a particular browser or device with another computer or device that is linked to the browser or device on which such information was collected.

We may retain information we collect from or about you for as long as reasonably required to satisfy the purposes for which we have collected the information, or as required by law, whichever is longer. This means we will retain information about you both while you are an active user of our Websites and after you cease to be an active user.

**HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH OTHERS**

We share information we collect from or about you with third parties as described below. In addition, we may share information that does not personally identify you, such as aggregate information, de-identified information, device identifiers, or other unique identifiers with third parties. For information about how to manage information about you and the choices you have, see the **Your Choices** section below.

**Third-Party Service Providers:** We engage third-party service providers to perform functions on our behalf such as: hosting, content syndication, content management, technical integration, marketing, analytics, customer service, fraud protection, payment processing, fulfillment, and shipping.

We may transfer some or all information about you in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, acquisition, sale of assets, or any line of business, change in ownership control, or financing transaction. Under such circumstances, we will request the acquiring party to follow the practices described in this Privacy Policy with respect to previously collected information. Nevertheless, we cannot promise that an acquiring party or the merged entity will have the same privacy practices or treat information about you in the same way as described in this Privacy Policy.

**Law Enforcement, Legal Process, and Emergency Situations:** We may also use or disclose information we collect from or about you if required to do so by law or on the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to applicable law or comply with legal process served on us or our Websites; (b) protect and defend our rights or property, the Websites, or our users; (c) respond to a third party that alleges that you have infringed their intellectual property rights; or (d) act to protect the personal safety of us, users of the Websites, or the public.

**Public Areas, Interactive Features and Activities:** Please remember that any information you share in public areas, including in your public profile, or on social sharing features becomes public and anyone may take and use that information.

If you are under the age of eighteen and a registered user, you may have a content or information you have posted removed from public display by deleting the message yourself or contacting the community manager.

**At Your Direction:** Our Websites may give you the ability to share certain information with other users or other third parties, such as by scanning your “My Code.” When you engage these features on our Websites, you are authorizing us to share your information. Once shared, we have no control how those third parties will use or further disclose your information.

**HOW TO ACCESS AND UPDATE YOUR INFORMATION**

If you have an account with us, you can update information you have provided by logging into your account and editing the information. Please note that you may not be able to change some information, like your username or email, after your account is established. You may be required to provide us with sufficient information to verify your identity prior to accessing any records containing information about you. We may not accommodate a request to change information about you if we believe doing so would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.

**COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES**

Like many websites, we use tracking technologies such as cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to record your preferences, track the use of our Websites, your interactions with our emails, and measure exposure to our online advertisements. We may also use these technologies to monitor traffic, improve the Websites, and make it easier to use and more relevant. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can usually modify your browser setting to disable or reject cookies. In addition, you may also render some web beacons unusable by rejecting or removing their associated cookies. If you delete your cookies or if you set your browser to decline cookies, some features of the Websites may not work or may not work as designed.

We use third-party analytics services on the Websites, including Google Analytics. These analytics service providers use cookies or other tracking technologies to help us analyze how users interact with and use our Websites, compile reports about activity on Websites, and provide us other services. The technologies may collect information such as your IP address, time of visit, whether you are a return visitor, any referring website, general location, and other information. We do not use these analytics service providers to gather information that personally identifies you. The information generated by Google Analytics will be transmitted to and stored by Google and will be subject to Google’s [privacy policies](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/). To learn more about Google’s partner services and to learn how to opt out of tracking of analytics by Google click [here](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/).

We work with third-party companies who also use these technologies to provide advertisements on our Websites and other third-party websites. These third parties may use these technologies to collect information about you when you use the Websites. They may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services. They may also use persistent identifiers to track your Internet usage across other websites in their networks beyond our Websites. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based advertising or other targeted content. While we do not knowingly provide these entities with information that personally identifies you, such third parties may, with sufficient data from other sources, be able to personally identify you, unknown to us. More information about how to opt-out of these cookies is available in the **Choices** section below.

The cookies used on our Websites are divided into four general categories:

_Necessary:_ Cookies that are essential to make our Websites usable by enabling basic functions like page navigation, access to secures areas of the Website, and whether you have opted-out of certain non-necessary cookies.

We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices on any website not operated by us to which our Websites links or that links to our Websites.

Your browser or device may include “Do Not Track” functionality. Our information collection, disclosure practices, and the choices that we provide, will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy, whether or not a Do Not Track signal is received.

**YOUR CHOICES ABOUT HOW INFORMATION ABOUT YOU IS USED AND SHARED**

In many instances, you have choices about the information you provide and how we use that information. These choices are described below.
