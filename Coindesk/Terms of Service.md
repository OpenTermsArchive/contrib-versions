Terms Of Use
============

Effective Date: February 23, 2023.

Welcome to the CoinDesk website and related interactive features, products, services, applications, or downloads (collectively, the “Websites”) that are owned by CoinDesk, Inc., including our affiliates and subsidiaries (“Company,” “we” and “us). **BY USING OUR WEBSITES, YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE PRACTICES DESCRIBED IN THESE TERMS OF USE (“TERMS”) AND OUR** **[PRIVACY POLICY](https://www.coindesk.com/privacy/). IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT USE THESE WEBSITES. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MODIFY OR AMEND THESE TERMS FROM TIME TO TIME WITHOUT NOTICE. YOUR CONTINUED USE OF OUR WEBSITES OR ANY AFFILIATED WEBSITES FOLLOWING THE POSTING OF CHANGES TO THESE TERMS WILL MEAN YOU ACCEPT THOSE CHANGES.**

**EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES DESCRIBED IN THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE SECTION BELOW, YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND USE WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.**

**Agreement to Arbitrate.** The parties acknowledge that any statutory or common law claims related to intellectual property may require forms of equitable relief that are best administered by courts; accordingly, the parties agree that except for statutory or common law claims related to intellectual property and disputes that qualify for small claims court, any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, will be resolved by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in accordance with its “Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes.” Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction located in the County of New York in the State of New York. For more information about arbitration, the AAA, and the arbitration process, please consult the American Arbitration Association web site at [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/). You agree that by agreeing to these Terms, you and we are each waiving the right to trial by jury, except as otherwise stated above. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except those issues relating to the interpretation of the scope, application, and enforceability of this arbitration provision are for a court to decide. As stated in _General_ section below, New York law applies to any arbitration under these Terms, but the parties acknowledge that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This agreement to arbitrate shall survive termination of these Terms. This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.

Unless you and we agree otherwise, the arbitration will take place in the County of New York in the State of New York. For claims of $14,000 or less, you can choose whether you would like arbitration carried out based only on documents submitted to the arbitrator, or by a hearing in person, by phone, or via online video conference.

The arbitrator may award money or equitable relief in favor of only the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. To reduce the time and expense of the arbitration, the arbitrator will not provide a statement of reasons for their award unless requested to do so by both parties. Unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

**Waiver of Class Actions.** YOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING DISPUTES AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, A FEDERAL OR STATE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT.

**Order Eligibility.** Unless otherwise stated at the time of purpose, you may only purchase products and services for personal, non-commercial use.

Not all available rewards are assigned to each token, the rewards are subject to change, and additional requirements may apply in order to redeem a reward.
