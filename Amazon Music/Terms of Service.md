**(a) Unlimited Plans. Fees. Upgrades and Downgrades**. We may offer paid plans that allow you to access Unlimited Content (each, an "Unlimited Plan"). If you subscribe to an Unlimited Plan directly through us, the applicable subscription fees are described in our detail pages and Help Pages. From time to time, we may change the Unlimited Plans, as well as the applicable fees for those plans. The amount of the fee and the next due date are available in your Amazon Music Settings. Unless legally required, the price stated does not include any taxes that we may charge. Payment is non-refundable, except as described in section 5.1. section 5.3. or, if you signed up through a third party and are not billed directly by us, as described in the billing terms provided by the third party. In case of third-party billing, the third party should, if legally required, charge you any applicable taxes. If you upgrade your Unlimited Plan, the upgrade will take effect immediately, we will charge you the applicable fee, and the term of your Unlimited Plan may be extended, as described at the time you upgrade your Unlimited Plan. If you downgrade your Unlimited Plan, unless otherwise specified, the downgrade will take effect at the end of the term of your existing Unlimited Plan.

**(b) Family Unlimited Plans**. A Family Unlimited Plan allows you to share Unlimited Content with up to five family members. All Family Unlimited Plan members must be 13 years of age or older, unless a higher minimum age applies to your Location, e.g. 14 years (Spain), 15 years (France), 16 years (Germany and Italy). You can find additional information regarding minimum age requirements for other European Union Locations, if applicable, when you invite family members to your Family Unlimited Plan. If you invite a minor to the Family Unlimited Plan, you must either be the parent or legal guardian of the minor, or act with the parent's or legal guardian's consent. In the United States, parents may give permission for children under 13 to access Amazon Music Unlimited. Minors may use their Amazon account, including access to the Family Unlimited Plan and privacy settings, only with involvement of a parent or guardian.

Unless otherwise specified, all sales are final and risk of loss transfers upon sale. We do not accept returns of Purchased Music. When you purchase Music Content from the Store, you are directing us to store that Purchased Music for you.

**2\. GENERAL SUBSCRIPTION PLAN TERMS**.

**2.1 Promotional and Trial Offers**. We may offer trial or promotional Unlimited Plans (each, a "Trial Plan"). Some Trial Plans may, as communicated to you, automatically convert to a paid plan unless you cancel before the end of the Trial Plan.

**2.2 Payment. Renewal**.

If you sign up through us and are billed by us, then the billing terms described below in this section 2.2 will apply to your subscription.

For customers on an Unlimited Plan, if all payment methods we have on file for you are declined for payment of your Unlimited Plan, you have 3 days to provide us a new payment method or your Unlimited Plan will be canceled. If you provide us with a new payment method and are successfully charged within 3 days, your new Unlimited Plan term will be based on the original renewal/subscription date and not the date of the successful charge.

UNLESS YOU NOTIFY US BEFORE A CHARGE THAT YOU DO NOT WANT TO AUTO RENEW, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR UNLIMITED PLAN WILL AUTOMATICALLY CONTINUE AND YOU AUTHORIZE US TO COLLECT THE THEN-APPLICABLE FEE AND APPLICABLE TAXES FOR THE UNLIMITED PLAN, USING ANY PAYMENT METHOD WE HAVE ON RECORD FOR YOU. UNLIMITED PLAN FEES AND FEATURES MAY CHANGE OVER TIME. HOWEVER, ANY INCREASE IN THE FEE WILL NOT AFFECT THE COST OF YOUR UNLIMITED PLAN DURING ITS TERM. YOUR RENEWAL PLAN WILL BE THE ONE WE CHOOSE AS BEING CLOSEST TO YOUR UNLIMITED PLAN.

You may cancel the auto renewal of your Unlimited Plan by visiting Amazon Music Settings and adjusting your subscription settings. If you cancel your subscription, you will not receive a refund of any fees already paid.

If you signed up through a third party and are not billed directly by us, then the billing terms provided by the third party will apply to you.
