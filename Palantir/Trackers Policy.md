How long a cookie stays on your device, i.e. its lifespan, depends on whether it is a "persistent" or "session" cookie. We may use “session” cookies as well as “persistent” cookies.

*   **“Session cookies”** only last until your browser is closed. They are then deleted.
    
*   **“Persistent cookies”** will remain on your device until they expire or are deleted by you or your browser.
    

Who owns and controls a cookie depends on whether it is a “first-party cookie” or “third-party cookie.”

*   Cookies that are owned and controlled by us are called “**first-party cookies**”.
    
*   Cookies that are owned and controlled by parties other than Palantir are called “**third-party cookies**”.
    

Thus, the third parties – and not Palantir – are responsible for the use of third-party cookie data. As such, we try to capture but cannot guarantee that we have listed every cookie you might get from a third party and the purpose it uses the information for since a third party could change these cookies at any time as their needs change.

Web beacons provide information such as the IP address and browser type related to the visitor's computer. Web beacons may be placed on online advertisements that bring people to our Sites and on different pages of our Sites.
    
*   **Local storage** is often used to remember choices a user has made inside a Web application or to cache information to improve performance. We may also use third party SDKs, including to enable analytics or other features on mobile devices.
