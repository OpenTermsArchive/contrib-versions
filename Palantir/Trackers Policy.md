How long a cookie stays on your device, i.e. its lifespan, depends on whether it is a "persistent" or "session" cookie. We may use “session” cookies as well as “persistent” cookies.

* **“Session cookies”** only last until your browser is closed. They are then deleted.
    
* **“Persistent cookies”** will remain on your device until they expire or are deleted by you or your browser.
    

Who owns and controls a cookie depends on whether it is a “first-party cookie” or “third-party cookie.”

* Cookies that are owned and controlled by us are called “**first-party cookies**”.
    
* Cookies that are owned and controlled by parties other than Palantir are called “**third-party cookies**”.
