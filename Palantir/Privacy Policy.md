**Who is Palantir?**

We are a technology company founded in the United States in 2003. We provide software platforms and services to help public, private, and non-governmental organizations gain insights into their data through data analysis, in a secure and privacy-protective way.

_Data Controllers_

Palantir is a global company made up of multiple entities that process personal data in the course of conducting our business. Depending on where you engage with us, the entity responsible as controller for the processing of your personal data under this Statement may vary. Palantir Technologies Inc. is the parent company of the group, but the data controller of your information may be one of its affiliates depending on how you interact with Palantir entities. If you visit a Palantir office or engage with an employee of a Palantir office outside of the US, the Palantir affiliate based in that country will be the relevant data controller of your personal data. For example, if you attend a Palantir event in our London office, Palantir Technologies UK, Ltd. would be the data controller of your personal data. To understand where Palantir has affiliates around the world, please see here. In this Statement, where we refer to “Palantir,” “we,” “our,” or “us,” we are referring to the relevant Palantir group entity that decides how and why your information is used.

Why should you read this Statement and what does it cover?
----------------------------------------------------------

Open

**Why should you read this Statement?**

As a commercial business, Palantir may collect, use, and disclose personal data in the course of our standard operations. Where a Palantir entity processes your personal data as controller (meaning that we determine why and how your personal data is used), this Statement sets out how we process that data in compliance with data protection and consumer privacy laws. This Statement also explains what rights you have relating to that personal data.

**What does this Statement cover?**

This Statement sets out how we use and protect personal data globally. If you live or work in certain countries, states or territories, there is _additional_ information at the end of this Statement that relates to our use of your personal data.

It is important to note that this Statement does not apply to personal data we process on behalf of our customers. When we provide our products and services to our customers, we act as a data processor. This means it is our customers, and not Palantir, who are in control of what personal data and other information they process using our products or services, and how they do so. Where we are a data processor, we follow our customers’ instructions relating to that processing, in line with applicable laws.

Consequently, this Statement does not apply to our customers’ processing of personal data using Palantir products or services. If you are seeking to understand how one of our customers processes personal data using Palantir products or services – or if you wish to exercise your rights in relation to any personal data a customer may process using Palantir products or services – the relevant customer’s privacy statement is the best place to start to understand those details, or to learn how to contact them.

As you engage with our services or communications, you may encounter links to third parties outside of the control of Palantir that enable you to share information with the controllers of those websites or services. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or the data collection, use, or disclosure practices of our customers, or third-party sites, unless we notify you otherwise. If you wish to understand how they process your personal data, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of each site you visit.

**Palantir job candidates**

If you apply for a role with Palantir, our [Candidate Privacy Statement](https://www.palantir.com/privacy-and-security/candidate-privacy-notice/) contains information on how we will use your personal data.

**Updates to this Statement**

We may make updates to this Statement from time to time. When we do so, we will post those changes here, so please check back periodically for any updates. Where we make changes to our processing that may affect the rights of individuals affected by those changes, we will inform those individuals where possible.

**Personal Information we collect**

Under the CCPA, “Personal Information” is information that identifies, relates to, or could reasonably be linked with a particular consumer or household. “Personal Information” does not include publicly available information, deidentified or aggregated information, or information covered by certain sector-specific privacy laws. “Sensitive Personal Information” refers to information that reveals a consumer’s social security, driver’s license, state identification card, or passport number; account log-in, financial account, debit card, or credit card number in combination with any required security or access code, password, or credentials allowing access to an account; precise geolocation; racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, or union membership; contents of mail, email, and text messages unless Palantir is the intended recipient of the communication; genetic data; and biometric information.

Below, we identify (1) the categories of Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information (as listed in the CCPA) that we plan to collect and use, and have collected and used within the preceding 12 months; (2) the categories of recipients to which we have disclosed each category of Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information for our operational business purposes within the preceding 12 months; (3) the criteria we use to determine the retention period for each category of Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information; and (4) the categories of Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information we have sold or shared within the preceding 12 months, as “sale” and “sharing” are defined in the CCPA.

Please note, we do not sell Personal Information in the traditional sense of the word for monetary consideration. However, because the definitions of “sale” and “sharing” under the CCPA are broad enough to potentially include the disclosure of your information to certain types of advertising and marketing partners, we provide consumers with the right to opt-out of any such sale or sharing of their Personal Information. We do not knowingly sell or share the Personal Information of anyone under 16 years old.

We may use Personal Information to generate deidentified data sets. To the extent we treat data as deidentified under the CCPA, we will maintain and use that data solely in deidentified form and will not attempt to reidentify that data with any individuals, other than to assess whether the deidentification process complies with applicable law or as otherwise permitted by applicable law.

**Use of Sensitive Personal Information**

Sensitive Personal Information is only used or disclosed to perform the services or provide the goods reasonably expected by an average consumer who requests those goods or services; to prevent, detect, and investigate security incidents that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity, or confidentiality of stored or transmitted Personal Information or other information; to resist malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, harmful or illegal actions directed at the business and to prosecute those responsible for those actions; to ensure the physical safety of natural persons; short-term, transient use; or perform services on behalf of the business.

Any disclosures of your information to third parties over the preceding 12 months have been in accordance with the permitted categories in the [_When do we disclose your personal information_](https://www.palantir.com/privacy-and-security/www.palantir.com/privacy-and-security#when-do-we-share-your-personal-data) section of the Privacy Statement above.

**Your CCPA Rights**

California residents may make the following types of requests under the CCPA:

**Requests to Know, Delete, Correct or Opt-out of Sharing:**

Request to Know: You may request that we disclose the following information to you about our collection and use of your Personal Information, in each case including Sensitive Personal Information: (1) the categories of Personal Information we collected about you; (2) the categories of sources from which we collected this Personal Information; (3) the categories of Personal Information that we have sold, shared, or disclosed, (4) the categories of recipients to whom this information was sold, shared, or disclosed; (5) the business or commercial purpose for selling, sharing, or disclosing Personal Information; and (6) the specific pieces of information we collected about you.

Request to Opt-Out of the Sale or Sharing: You may opt out of our “sale” of Personal Information or “sharing” of Personal Information.

**How to Submit Requests to Know, Delete, or Correct**

If you would like to exercise a CCPA right with respect to Palantir, please complete the form [here](https://www.palantir.com/privacy-and-security/data-request) or submit an email request to ccpa-requests@palantir.com with “California Request to Know,” “California Request to Delete,” or “California Request to Correct” in the subject line. For a “Request to Know,” please specify what details you would like to know, including any specific pieces of Personal Information you would like to access. For a “Request to Delete,” please specify what information you would like to have deleted (which may be all your information as required by the CCPA). For a “Request to Correct,” please specify what information you would like to have corrected.

If you submit a request, we may ask for information necessary to verify your identity and eligibility to assert this right, and we will respond to verified requests in accordance with the CCPA.

If your request relates to Personal Information that we process about you as a service provider or contractor on behalf of a customer, please direct your request to our relevant customer. If you wish to make your request directly to us, please provide the name of our customer on whose behalf we processed your Personal Information. We will refer your request to that customer and will support them to the extent required by applicable law in responding to your request.

**Authorized Agent.** You may also utilize an authorized agent to exercise your CCPA rights on your behalf. As part of our verification process, we may request that an authorized agent provide, as applicable, proof concerning status as an authorized agent to act on your behalf. If an authorized agent is making a Request to Know, Request to Delete, or Right to Correct on behalf of a California resident and has not provided a power of attorney from the resident pursuant to Probate Code sections 4121-4130, we may also require the resident to verify their own identity directly with us; or directly confirm with us that they provided you permission to submit the request.

**Right to non-discrimination.** You may not be discriminated against because you exercise any of your rights under the CCPA, and Palantir is committed to this principle.

**How to Submit Requests to Opt-Out of Sale or Sharing**

To opt-out of sale or sharing, please visit “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” by submitting a form [here](https://www.palantir.com/privacy-and-security/data-request), clicking on “Cookie Settings” which can be found at the bottom left of this web page, or by emailing us at ccpa-requests@palantir.com. Due to a lack of industry standard to enable the recognition of “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) privacy preferences we cannot commit to recognize and honor all “Do Not Track” preferences. However, we do recognize opt-out preference signals as required by the CCPA. Opt-out preference signals will be processed in accordance with the CCPA.
