**Who is Palantir?**

We are a technology company founded in the United States in 2003. We provide software platforms and services to help public, private, and non-governmental organizations gain insights into their data through data analysis, in a secure and privacy-protective way. You can read more about our business [here](https://www.palantir.com/offerings/).

This Privacy Statement (“Statement”) applies to the processing activities for which Palantir Technologies Inc. and its affiliates act as “data controllers” on their own behalf. This Statement does not cover our customers’ processing of personal data using Palantir products or services, as we act solely are only acting as “data processor” for such processing activities. For more information, please refer to the sections entitled _Data Controllers_ and [_What does this Statement cover_](https://www.palantir.com/privacy-and-security#why-should-you-read-this-statement-and-what-does-it-cover)_?_ sections below.

_Data Controllers_

Palantir is a global company made up of multiple entities that process personal data in the course of conducting our business. Depending on where you engage with us, the entity responsible as controller for the processing of your personal data under this Statement may vary. Palantir Technologies Inc. is the parent company of the group, but the data controller of your information may be one of its affiliates depending on how you interact with Palantir entities. If you visit a Palantir office or engage with an employee of a Palantir office outside of the US, the Palantir affiliate based in that country will be the relevant data controller of your personal data. For example, if you attend a Palantir event in our London office, Palantir Technologies UK, Ltd. would be the data controller of your personal data. To understand where Palantir has affiliates around the world, please see [here](https://www.palantir.com/Data-Protection-Affiliates). In this Statement, where we refer to “Palantir,” “we,” “our,” or “us,” we are referring to the relevant Palantir group entity that decides how and why your information is used.

Why should you read this Statement and what does it cover?
----------------------------------------------------------

Open

**Why should you read this Statement?**

As a commercial business, Palantir may collect, use, and disclose personal data in the course of our standard operations. Where a Palantir entity processes your personal data as controller (meaning that we determine why and how your personal data is used), this Statement sets out how we process that data in compliance with data protection and consumer privacy laws. This Statement also explains what rights you have relating to that personal data.

**What does this Statement cover?**

This Statement sets out how we use and protect personal data globally. If you live or work in certain countries, states or territories, there is _additional_ information at the end of this Statement that relates to our use of your personal data.

It is important to note that this Statement does not apply to personal data we process on behalf of our customers. When we provide our products and services to our customers, we act as a data processor. This means it is our customers, and not Palantir, who are in control of what personal data and other information they process using our products or services, and how they do so. Where we are a data processor, we follow our customers’ instructions relating to that processing, in line with applicable laws.

Consequently, this Statement does not apply to our customers’ processing of personal data using Palantir products or services. If you are seeking to understand how one of our customers processes personal data using Palantir products or services – or if you wish to exercise your rights in relation to any personal data a customer may process using Palantir products or services – the relevant customer’s privacy statement is the best place to start to understand those details, or to learn how to contact them.

As you engage with our services or communications, you may encounter links to third parties outside of the control of Palantir that enable you to share information with the controllers of those websites or services. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or the data collection, use, or disclosure practices of our customers, or third-party sites, unless we notify you otherwise. If you wish to understand how they process your personal data, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of each site you visit.

**Palantir job candidates**

If you apply for a role with Palantir, our [Candidate Privacy Statement](https://www.palantir.com/privacy-and-security/candidate-privacy-notice/) contains information on how we will use your personal data.

**Updates to this Statement**

We may make updates to this Statement from time to time. When we do so, we will post those changes here, so please check back periodically for any updates. Where we make changes to our processing that may affect the rights of individuals affected by those changes, we will inform those individuals where possible.

**Where we need your personal data to comply with a contractual obligation or the law.** Where we require your personal data to fulfil our contract with you, or to comply with a legal obligation, if you fail to provide us with the personal data we need, it might prevent us from being able to comply with our obligations under that contract or fulfil our legal obligations, which might ultimately prevent us from providing you with our products or services. We will let you know where this is the case.

**Personal Information we collect**

“Personal Information” is defined under each US State Privacy Law and includes information that identifies, relates to, or could reasonably be linked with a particular consumer or household. “Personal Information” does not include publicly available information, deidentified or aggregated information, or information covered by certain sector- specific privacy laws. “Sensitive Personal Information” is defined under each US State Privacy Law.

Below, we identify (1) the categories of Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information that we plan to collect, process, and use, and have collected, processed, and used within the preceding 12 months; (2) the categories of recipients to which we have disclosed each category of Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information for our operational business purposes within the preceding 12 months; (3) the criteria we use to determine the retention period for each category of Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information; and (4) the categories of Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information we have sold or shared within the preceding 12 months, as “sale” and “sharing” are defined under the respective US State Privacy Laws.

Please note, we do not sell Personal Information in the traditional sense of the word for monetary consideration. However, because the definitions of “sale” and “sharing” under the US State Privacy Laws are broad enough such that they include the disclosure of your information to certain types of advertising and marketing partners, we provide consumers with the right to opt-out of any such sale or sharing of their Personal Information. We do not knowingly sell or share the Personal Information of anyone under 16 years old.
