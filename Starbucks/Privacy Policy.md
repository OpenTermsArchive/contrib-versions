**7\. Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies**

We and others may use a variety of technologies to collect information about your device and use of our websites and mobile applications. These technologies include first- and third-party cookies, web beacons, JavaScript, entity tags, and HTML local storage. Most web browsers can be programmed to accept or reject the use of some or all of these technologies, although you must take additional steps to disable or control other technologies. For more information on exercising your preferences in relation to cookies and similar technologies, please see the section of this Notice titled “Your Choices & Rights”.

* **Cookies** – Cookies are small data files that are sent from a website’s server and are stored on your device’s hard drive either for only the duration of your visit (“session cookies”) or for a fixed period (“persistent cookies”). Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server.

You may be able to reject cookies, web beacons, entity tags and HTML5 local storage by adjusting the appropriate settings in your browser. Each browser is different, but many browsers have preferences or options that may be adjusted to allow you to either accept or reject cookies and certain other technologies before they are set or installed, or allow you to remove or reject the use or installation of certain technologies altogether. If you want to learn the correct way to modify your browser settings, please use the Help menu in your browser or review the instructions provided by the following browsers: Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari Desktop, Safari Mobile; and Android browser.

* **Interest-Based Ads** – Many advertising companies that collect information for interest-based advertising are members of the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) or the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), both of which maintain websites where people can opt out of interest-based advertising from their members. To opt-out of website interest-based advertising provided by each organization’s respective participating companies, visit the DAA’s opt-out portal available at http://optout.aboutads.info/, the DAA of Canada’s opt-out portal available at https://youradchoices.ca/en/tools, or visit the NAI’s opt-out portal available at http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1.

Residents of the European Union may opt-out of online behavioral advertising served by the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance’s participating member organizations by visiting https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/.

To opt-out of data collection for interest-based advertising across mobile applications by participating companies, download the DAA’s App Choices mobile application opt-out offering at https://youradchoices.com/appchoices.

* **Adobe Flash Player Technology** – We allow Adobe to set and enable special cookies that are necessary to deliver video content for Adobe Flash Player. You cannot remove Flash cookies simply by changing your browser settings. If you would like to limit the websites that can store information in Flash cookies on your device, you must visit the Adobe website:  
    [http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings\_manager07.html](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html)

* **Web Beacons** – Web beacons are small, transparent images that are embedded in web pages, applications, and emails that are sometimes called “clear gifs,” “single pixel gifs”, “page tags” or “web bugs.” We use web beacons to track the web pages you visit, to test the effectiveness of our marketing, and to find out if an email has been opened and acted on.
* **JavaScript** – JavaScript are code snippets embedded in various parts of websites and applications that facilitate a variety of operations including accelerating the refresh speed of certain functionality or monitoring usage of various online components.
* **Entity Tags** -- Entity Tags are HTTP code mechanisms that allow portions of websites to be stored or “cached” within your browser and validates these caches when the website is opened, accelerating website performance since the web server does not need to send a full response if the content has not changed.
* **HTML5 Local Storage** – HTML5 local storage allows data from websites to be stored or “cached” within your browser to store and retrieve data in HTML5 pages when the website is revisited. These and similar technologies are used for the following purposes:
* **Services and Functionality** – Some of these technologies are required to allow you to access and use our websites or mobile applications and the various services and functionality we offer. Without these technologies, some of the services and functionality on our websites and mobile applications would not work properly.
* **Performance Monitoring** – Some of these technologies help us analyze and estimate traffic and assess the volume of use of services and functionality on websites and mobile applications. They show us how visitors and customers interact with our digital properties, whether there are any errors, the degree to which certain web pages, applications, services or functionality are accessed and used and how they are performing or operating. When these technologies are used for performance monitoring, no directly identifiable information (e.g., your name, email address or phone number) is collected.
* **User Convenience** – Some of these technologies enhance the ease of use of our websites and mobile applications and the services and functionality they make available by accelerating load and refresh times and remembering information that you have provided on prior visits to our websites or when you last used a website or mobile application service or functionality.
* **Marketing** – Some of these technologies are used to tailor your experience on our website, within our mobile applications, or across your applications or devices by controlling the promotions, advertisements and other marketing messages that may appear when you access or use these or other digital properties.

Taken together, these technologies help us learn which services and functionality you are using and how you are accessing information about us. We may use this information to personalize your visit to a website or use of a mobile application or to send you relevant promotions and advertisements.

**8\. How We Protect Your Information**

Starbucks uses reasonable technical, physical, and administrative security measures to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or modification of your information. However, no security system is perfect, and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that data, including personal information, is absolutely safe from intrusion or other unauthorized access by others. You are responsible for protecting your password(s) and maintaining the security of your devices.

**9\. Retention**

Starbucks stores information as reasonably necessary and proportionate to accomplish the purposes identified in this Notice based on criteria such as the length of time we need to provide the services to you, and to meet legal requirements, including record retention, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. Our retention of your information is governed by applicable law. 

The personal information that you provide us is stored and processed on servers owned by Starbucks and other companies in the United States, Canada or elsewhere around the world, including locations outside of the country or jurisdiction where you are located. Regardless of the company or person who processes your information and where it is processed, we will take steps to transfer and protect your information through appropriate safeguards in accordance with applicable data protection laws and this Notice.

**10\. Children’s Privacy**

We do not intend for our websites or online services to be used by anyone under the age of 13.

    If you allow for location sharing, your device may communicate with us in ways that allow for us to customize your experience in and around Starbucks stores, to monitor the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, to tailor messages based on your time and location patterns, and to limit the number of times you see a promotional message or offer. Precise geolocation may be used to fulfill services and application functionality you choose to engage with. You can manage the use of that personal information at any time in your device settings.  
      
    For most mobile devices, you can disable the collection of geolocation information by turning off location services on your device.  If you have any questions about how to prevent Starbucks from collecting your geolocation, we recommend you contact your mobile device service provider or the device manufacturer. Certain Starbucks App features and some Starbucks Services may not work properly without information about your location. You can re-enable the collection of geolocation information, at any time, by turning on location services on your device.

If you opt-out of receiving promotional emails from us, we may still send communications to you about your orders and transactions, and any accounts you have with us. Please note that when you opt-out of receiving promotional emails, you may still receive automated marketing text messages if you have opted-in to receiving them.
* **Text Messages –** In connection with certain Starbucks Services you may consent to receiving automated marketing text messages. You may opt-out of receiving automated marketing text messages at any time by texting any of the following replies at the end of any text message you receive: STOP, END, CANCEL, UNSUBSCRIBE, or QUIT. Please note that when you opt-out of receiving automated marketing text messages you may still receive promotional emails.

If you use the Starbucks App features described above, you consent to the transmission of your user information to Starbucks and/or its agents, and authorize Starbucks and/or its agents, to record, process, and store such user information as necessary for administering the Starbucks App features and for purposes described in this Notice.

Starbucks only collects, uses, and discloses your sensitive personal information to provide services to you, therefore Starbucks is not required to provide this link.

**13.  Notice of Financial Incentive & Starbucks® Rewards**

Starbucks® Rewards is one way in which Starbucks endeavors to reward and thank loyal customers for patronizing our business and purchasing Starbucks products.  Starbucks® Rewards members opt in by signing up for Rewards online or through the Starbucks App and are able to earn and accumulate "Stars" that can be redeemed for Starbucks® Rewards benefits at participating Starbucks stores. If you would like to become a Starbucks® Rewards member, please see the Starbucks Rewards Terms of Use available at [https://www.starbucks.com/rewards/terms](https://www.starbucks.com/rewards/terms).

Starbucks collects and uses the categories of personal information described in the “Information We Collect” section, including information you voluntarily provide us (such as your name and email), information we collect automatically, and information from other sources to operate the Starbucks® Rewards loyalty program, including to send you promotions, content, and special offers and the other uses described in this Notice.  We work with many service providers and business partners to offer the benefits of our Starbucks® Rewards loyalty program.  Those partners may fall into the following categories: delivery partners, Starbucks global licensees, subsidiaries, and affiliates, and or service providers and business partners.  You can learn about the business partners with whom we share your information by referring to the “How We Disclose Your Information” section.  Starbucks does not assign monetary value for the information we collect through the Starbucks® Rewards loyalty program when sending email communications.  You may opt out of receiving promotional emails at any time by adjusting your Starbucks online account settings, or by clicking the “unsubscribe” link included within any promotional emails we send you. Participation in Starbucks® Rewards is voluntary, and you may withdraw from the Starbucks® Rewards loyalty program by visiting the Account section in the Starbucks App, by requesting deletion of your information by filling out this form **[HERE](https://privacyportal-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/f9975fc5-c93f-4ff8-8169-846d8f6cd4d2/dd7e8c8f-839f-4be3-9ebc-060786941e92.html)**, or by calling Starbucks customer service. Please note that by withdrawing from Starbucks® Rewards, you will no longer have access to your Starbucks® Rewards account, but you can otherwise continue to use the Starbucks app. All points and rewards you have earned until the time of withdrawal will no longer be available.  As previously shared, to communicate and provide services to you through the Starbucks® Rewards loyalty program, we need to use your personal information. Therefore, if you choose to delete your personal information from the Starbucks® Rewards loyalty program, we can no longer provide you with services through this loyalty program. 

Based on our reasonable and good faith estimate, we receive value from Starbucks® Rewards in increased customer loyalty and patronage, though any value will vary by Starbucks® Rewards member depending on purchases made, which offers a member takes advantage of, and many other factors.

**14\. Additional Disclosures for Data Subjects in the EEA, the U.K., and Switzerland**

This section provides general information about how Starbucks collects, stores, uses, transfers and otherwise processes personal data in or from certain countries in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland (together, for purposes of this section of this Notice, “EEA”), in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and its local implementations. This section does not supersede the applicability of any privacy policy found on the website of an EEA-based Starbucks affiliate with whom you have engaged, as that entity would be the data controller with respect to your personal data and the entity to which your data subject rights requests should be directed.

**(a)  Lawful Bases of Processing** – Where a Starbucks entity is acting as a data controller that determines the purposes and means of processing your personal data, such as when we collect, use, and share personal data as described in this Notice, we must have a lawful basis for processing for doing so. Our lawful bases for processing personal data include:

* to conclude or perform a contract with you, for example to:
    
    * process your purchases of or requests for products and services, including delivering
    * gift cards in accordance with your instructions;
    * communicate with you about orders, purchases, returns, services, accounts, programs,
    * contests, and sweepstakes;
    
* for our legitimate business purposes, including to:
    
    * respond to your customer service inquiries and requests for information;
    * maintain, improve, and analyze our websites, mobile applications, ads, and the
    * products and services we offer;
    * detect, prevent, or investigate security breaches or fraud; and
    * facilitate the functionality of our websites and mobile applications;
    
* to comply with our legal obligations, for example to maintain appropriate records for internal administrative purposes and as required by applicable law, and provide important product safety information and notice of product recalls; and
