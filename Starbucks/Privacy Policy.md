*   **General Geolocation Information –** We may collect information about the imprecise or approximate location of your device, such as information derived from your device (e.g., based on a browser or device’s IP address).

For more information about our collection of precise geolocation, please see below.
*   **Audio, Electronic, Visual or Similar Information –** We may collect audio and visual information when you use the Starbucks Services.

We and others may use a variety of technologies to collect information about your device and use of our websites and mobile applications. These technologies include first- and third-party cookies, web beacons, pixels, JavaScript, entity tags, HTML local storage, and similar technologies. For example, cookies are small data files that are sent from a website’s server and are stored on your device’s hard drive either for only the duration of your visit (“session cookies”) or for a fixed period (“persistent cookies”). Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server.

Cookies and similar technologies are used for the following purposes:

*   **Services and Functionality –** Some of these technologies are necessary to allow you to access and use our websites or mobile applications and enable the various services and functionalities we offer, including displaying content and remembering your preferences and log-in. Without these technologies, some of the services and functionality on our websites and mobile applications would not work properly.
*   **Analytics –** Some of these technologies help us analyze and measure site usage, testing and performance, including by estimating traffic and assessing the volume of the use of services and functionality on websites and mobile applications. They show us how visitors and customers interact with our digital properties, whether there are any errors, the degree to which certain web pages, applications, services or functionality are accessed and used, and how they are performing or operating.
*   **Advertising –** Some of these technologies may be set by us or our advertising partners to tailor your experience on our website, within our mobile applications, or across your applications or devices by controlling the promotions, advertisements and other marketing messages that may appear when you access or use these or other digital properties.

Taken together, these technologies help us learn which services and functionality you are using and how you are accessing information about us. We may use this information to personalize your visit to a website or use of a mobile application or to send you relevant promotions and advertisements.

Most web browsers can be programmed to accept or reject the use of some or all of these technologies, although you must take additional steps to disable or control these technologies. You may be able to reject some or all of these technologies by adjusting the appropriate settings in your browser. Each browser is different, but many browsers have preferences or options that may be adjusted to allow you to either accept or reject cookies and certain other technologies before they are set or installed, or allow you to remove or reject the use or installation of certain technologies altogether. If you want to learn the correct way to modify your browser settings, please use the Help menu in your browser or review the instructions provided by your browser.

Starbucks uses reasonable technical, physical, and administrative security measures to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or modification of your information.

Starbucks stores information as reasonably necessary and proportionate to accomplish the purposes identified in this Notice based on criteria such as the length of time we need to provide the services to you, and to meet legal requirements, including record retention, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements.

    If you allow for location sharing, your device may communicate with us in ways that allow for us to customize your experience in and around Starbucks stores, to monitor the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, to tailor messages based on your time and location patterns, and to limit the number of times you see a promotional message or offer. Precise geolocation may be used to fulfill services and application functionality you choose to engage with. You can manage the use of that personal information at any time in your device settings.
    
    For most mobile devices, you can disable the collection of geolocation information by turning off location services on your device. If you have any questions about how to prevent Starbucks from collecting your geolocation, we recommend you contact your mobile device service provider or the device manufacturer. Certain Starbucks App features and some Starbucks Services may not work properly without information about your location. You can re-enable the collection of geolocation information, at any time, by turning on location services on your device.
    
*   **Voice Ordering –** In order to use certain Starbucks Services, such as voice ordering, when available, you must (a) enable “microphone” and “speech recognition” in the Starbucks App; and/or (b) set the permissions in your mobile device to allow communication of this information.
*   **Email Communications, Push Notifications, and In-App Messages –** The Starbucks App allows all customers to set preferences for receiving promotional email communications from Starbucks, receiving push notifications on your device, and receiving inbox messages. You may opt-out of receiving promotional emails at any time by adjusting your Starbucks online account settings or by clicking the “unsubscribe” link included within any promotional emails we send you. If you opt-out of receiving promotional emails from us, we may still send communications to you about your orders and transactions, and any accounts you have with us. Please note that when you opt-out of receiving promotional emails, you may still receive automated marketing text messages if you have opted-in to receiving them.
*   **Text Messages –** In connection with certain Starbucks Services you may consent to receiving automated text messages, including when you contact Customer Care or for marketing purposes. You may opt-out of receiving automated text messages at any time by texting any of the following replies at the end of any text message you receive: STOP, END, CANCEL, UNSUBSCRIBE, or QUIT.

You may have the right to opt-out of your personal information being sold or shared for purposes of targeted advertising. You may exercise this right with respect to such selling or sharing that takes place via cookies and similar technologies on this website by managing your preferences using the Cookie Preferences link at the bottom of the website. (You may need to repeat the Cookies Preference selections from each device and browser that you use in connection with Starbucks Services, as well as in a particular browser or device if you clear cookies or reset the browser.) Some web browsers allow customers to automatically exercise their right to opt-out of sale/sharing with all businesses they interact with online through that web browser by initiating an opt-out preference signal. We will honor such opt-out preference signals. To opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information for targeted advertising that does not take place via cookies or similar technologies on this website, please submit an opt-out request using the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link.
*   **Limit Use of Sensitive Information –** We do not collect, process or disclose sensitive personal information for the purpose of inferring characteristics about you or for any purpose other than when permitted under applicable law.

**15\. Additional Disclosures for Data Subjects in the EEA, the U.K., and Switzerland**

This section provides general information about how Starbucks collects, stores, uses, transfers and otherwise processes personal data in or from certain countries in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland (together, for purposes of this section of this Notice, “EEA”), in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and its local implementations. This section does not supersede the applicability of any privacy policy found on the website of an EEA-based Starbucks affiliate with whom you have engaged, as that entity would be the data controller with respect to your personal data and the entity to which your data subject rights requests should be directed.

**(a)   Lawful Bases of Processing –** Where a Starbucks entity is acting as a data controller that determines the purposes and means of processing your personal data, such as when we collect, use, and share personal data as described in this Notice, we must have a lawful basis for processing for doing so. Our lawful bases for processing personal data include:

*   to conclude or perform a contract with you, for example to:
    
    *   process your purchases of or requests for products and services, including delivering
    *   gift cards in accordance with your instructions;
    *   communicate with you about orders, purchases, returns, services, accounts, programs,
    *   contests, and sweepstakes;
    
*   for our legitimate business purposes, including to:
    
    *   respond to your customer service inquiries and requests for information;
    *   maintain, improve, and analyze our websites, mobile applications, ads, and the
    *   products and services we offer;
    *   detect, prevent, or investigate security breaches or fraud; and
    *   facilitate the functionality of our websites and mobile applications;
    
*   to comply with our legal obligations, for example to maintain appropriate records for internal administrative purposes and as required by applicable law, and provide important product safety information and notice of product recalls; and
*   on the basis of your consent, for example to send you via email and other electronic means personalized promotions and special offers or informing you about our brands, products, events, or other promotional purposes.

You can withdraw your consent at any time by modifying your promotional preferences in your Starbucks App account online, or by contacting us as described in the “Contact Us” section below.

**(b)  Your EEA Data Subject Rights –** Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:

*   **Request access** to your personal information (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you.
*   **Request correction** of the personal information that we hold about you.
*   **Request erasure** of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.
*   **Object to processing** of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party), or where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.
*   **Request the restriction of processing** of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you.
*   **Request the transfer** of your personal information to another party, when possible.
*   **Not be subject to automated decision-making** producing legal or significant effects on an individual, which we do not engage in.

To exercise any of these rights, please see the “Your Privacy Choices & Rights” section, or contact us as set forth in the “Contact Us” section below and specify which GDPR privacy right(s) you wish to exercise. We must verify your identity in order to honor your request, which we will respond to within 30 days of receipt.

**(c)   Retention –** As described in the “Retention” section, as a general rule, we keep your data for only as long as it is needed to complete the purpose for which it was collected or as required by law. We may need to keep your data for longer than our specified retention periods to honor your requests, including to continue keeping you opted out of marketing emails, or to comply with legal, regulatory, accounting or other obligations.

**(d)   Transfers Outside the EEA –** Your personal information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in a country other than the one in which it was collected, including the United States. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for Starbucks or for our third-party service providers. In such cases, we will take appropriate steps to ensure an adequate level of data protection of the recipient as required under the GDPR and as described in this Notice.

**(e)   Complaints –** If you have any issues with our compliance, you have the right to lodge a complaint with an EEA supervisory authority. We would, however, appreciate the opportunity to first address your concerns and would welcome you directing an inquiry first to us per the “Contact Us” section below, or to our U.S.-based third-party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at [https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request](https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request) You may also contact our Data Protection Officer (“DPO”) at any time at [privacy@starbucks.com](mailto:privacy@starbucks.com).
