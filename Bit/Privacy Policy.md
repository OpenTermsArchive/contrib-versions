If you create an Account using your login from a third-party account, such as Google, Facebook or Twitter, we will access and collect the personal information about you that the third-party account provides (which is based on your privacy settings with the third-party account), so that you can log into your Account with us.

Unless you request deletion of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy, all content submitted by you to the Services may be retained by Bitly, even after you terminate your Account and may continue to be shared by third parties, as described in this Privacy Policy.

When You Create a Bitly Link

One feature of the Services is the ability to create shortened uniform resource locators (URLs) of websites ("Bitly Link" or "Bitlinks"). Users can create Bitly Links without registering for an account. When you create a Bitly Link, Bitly collects and stores both the original URL and the shortened URL and, if you are logged in to your Account, we will associate that information with your Account. Bitly also collects and stores your IP address, your location, which we derive from your IP address, the time and date on which you shortened the original URL, and if you share a Bitly Link on a social networking platform, the name of the platform and your username on that platform.

When You Interact With a Bitly Link

Bitly automatically collects personal information about the interaction (such as clicks or views) with every Bitly Link created through the Services (either our bit.ly links or one of our branded domains) on a third-party website. This information includes, but is not limited to: (i) the IP address and location derived from the IP address. (ii) the referring websites or services. (iii) the time and date of each access. (iv) device settings, such as browser type, operating system, and language. (v) cookies, as described below, and mobile advertising identifiers and (v) information about sharing of the Bitly Link on Third Party Services such as Twitter and Facebook (collectively, “Bitly Link Metrics”). As described in this policy, we use Bitly Link Metrics to provide the Services, to understand and analyze how our Services are used and to identify trends, and to detect, deter and prevent malicious, fraudulent or unlawful activity.

For example, if you created a Bitly link on a computer connected to your residential WiFi network, and you soon thereafter clicked on a Bitly link on a mobile device connected to the same WiFi network, we may infer that a single individual created and clicked on the Bitly links because both events were associated with the same IP address in the same time period.

Other Legitimate Interests

We also may use personal information to pursue legitimate interests, such as direct marketing, research (including marketing research), network and information security, prevention of fraudulent, malicious and unlawful activities, or any other purpose disclosed to you at the time you provide personal information or allowed by law.

Account Information

Where permitted by law, if you register a Bitly Account with an email address on a domain owned by an organization, (for example, an employer or educational institution where you have an email account), we may share your email address and information about your Account, such as the number of links you have created, with that organization to explore the organization’s interest in creating or managing an enterprise account or for related purposes.

Information We Share With Customers

We may share the personal information we collect as described in this Privacy Policy with our customers. When you create a Bitly Link of one of our enterprise customer’s sites, the enterprise customer is able to view the unshortened original URL, the date and time the Bitly Link was created, the location where it was created as derived from your IP address, and aggregated information about clicks and views of the Bitly Links, including the number of times the Bitly Link was shared, whether or not it was viewed, comparison of that Bitly Links performance to that of all Bitly Links pointing to the same content, whether others are sharing a Bitly Link to the same content, geographic regions where the content is being viewed, and identification of social networks on which the Bitly Links appear. In addition, we may share Bitly Link Metrics with customers to help them detect, deter and prevent malicious, fraudulent or unlawful activity.

When creating a Bitly Link, you can share that Bitly Link through Third Party Services.
