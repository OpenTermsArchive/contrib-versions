**Notice of financial incentive**

We may offer financial incentives, as defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act, when you enroll in our My Rewards program.  My Rewards is a loyalty program in which participants earn and redeem points by engaging in eligible transactions, including, but not limited to, purchasing or leasing eligible GM vehicles at participating GM dealerships in the United States, purchasing certain goods or services from a participating dealer or online through participating GM websites, purchasing certain services from OnStar, or transacting with the My GM Rewards Credit Card.  For a complete description of the most current eligible transactions, as well as details on earning and redeeming points, go to [https://experience.gm.com/rewards](https://experience.gm.com/rewards).

We offer the My Rewards program to enhance our relationship with you so that you can enjoy more of our products and services at a lower price.  To become a My Rewards member and earn and receive program benefits, users must enroll by providing name, address, and email.  Users also have the option to complete a profile with additional information about hobbies and interests to allow for better tailored offers, but this information is not required for program membership.  In addition, new members of the My GM Rewards Credit Card are enrolled in My Rewards based on the data provided in the card application.  To provide the program benefits, we must receive and track the personal information provided when you enroll in the My Rewards program or when you engage in activities to earn points, such as contact information and purchase history.

In order to complete membership into My Rewards, you also must acknowledge both the [My GM Rewards Program Terms and Conditions](https://experience.gm.com/rewards/terms) and the [GM Privacy Statement](https://www.gm.com/privacy-statement). Consumers may withdraw from participation in the My Rewards program at any time by contacting a My Rewards Member Support Specialist at 844-764-2665.

Solely for purposes of complying with the California Consumer Privacy Act, we estimate that the value of a consumer’s data related to the My Rewards program to be, on average, $0.19 per program member.  We have calculated the value of a consumer’s data by estimating the expenses related to the provision of the My Rewards marketing program per member.
