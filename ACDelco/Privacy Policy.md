This website may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations about possible future events and thus are inherently uncertain. Our actual results may differ materially from forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including: (1) our ability to deliver new products, services and experiences that attract new, and are desired by existing, customers and to effectively compete in autonomous, ride-sharing and transportation as a service. (2) sales of crossovers, SUVs and full-size pick-up trucks. (3) our ability to reduce the costs associated with the manufacture and sale of electric vehicles. (4) the volatility of global sales and operations. (5) our significant business in China which subjects us to unique operational, competitive and regulatory risks. (6) our joint ventures, which we cannot operate solely for our benefit and over which we may have limited control. (7) changes in government leadership and laws (including tax laws), economic tensions between governments and changes in international trade policies, new barriers to entry and changes to or withdrawals from free trade agreements, changes in foreign exchange rates, economic downturns in foreign countries, differing local product preferences and product requirements, compliance with U.S. and foreign countries' export controls and economic sanctions, differing labor regulations and difficulties in obtaining financing in foreign countries. (8) our dependence on our manufacturing facilities. (9) the ability of suppliers to deliver parts, systems and components without disruption and on schedule. (10) prices of raw materials. (11) our highly competitive industry. (12) the possibility that competitors may independently develop products and services similar to ours despite our intellectual property rights. (13) security breaches and other disruptions to our vehicles, information technology networks and systems. (14) compliance with laws and regulations applicable to our industry, including those regarding fuel economy and emissions. (15) costs and risks associated with litigation and government investigations. (16) compliance with the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. (17) the cost and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services. (18) our ability to successfully and cost-efficiently restructure operations in various countries with minimal disruption. (19) our ability to realize production efficiencies and to achieve reductions in costs. (20) our ability to develop captive financing capability through GM Financial. and (21) significant increases in pension expense or projected pension contributions. A further list and description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. GM cautions readers not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. GM undertakes no obligation to update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements.
