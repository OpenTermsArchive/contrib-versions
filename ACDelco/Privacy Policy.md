**III. Frequently Asked Questions**

Q1: What are "GM affiliates"?  
A: As used in this privacy statement, GM affiliates are companies that are owned or controlled by GM, or those companies in which GM has a substantial ownership interest (for example, OnStar).

  
Q2: What is an example of a supplier that provides services to GM?  
A: Suppliers are companies that provide services on GM's behalf, such as mailing you a brochure you request.

  
Q3: What is an example of a GM business partner?  
A: By business partners, we mean independent companies that conduct joint marketing programs with GM. An example is Capital One N.A. which issues the GM Card, GM Flexible Earnings Card, and GM Extended Family Card. Another example is SiriusXM.  

  
Q4: What do you mean when you say "independent use" or that you will ask for my permission before sharing my information?  
A: By independent use, we mean for purposes unrelated to GM's and GM affiliates' products and services. For example, if you attend a Buick golf event and the co-sponsor of that event would like to receive the information from the registration form you filled out, you will be asked for your permission on the registration form.

  
Q5: What do dealers do with my personal information?  
A: GM dealers may use your personal information to contact you about your interest in GM products and services and to provide you with information about upcoming events and vehicle incentives. For questions about your dealer's specific privacy practices, please contact your dealer directly.

  
Q6: If I opt out of receiving communications from my dealer, will I still receive communications from GM? How can I opt-out of GM marketing communications?  
A: Yes, you may continue to receive communications from us. GM and GM dealers are separate legal entities with their own privacy practices. If you don't want to receive marketing messages from GM regarding our vehicles, you should call 1-866-MYPRIVACY (1-866-697-7482), or visit our Consumer Preference System website at www.gmcontactpreferences.com.

  
Q7: Will you use my personal information to send me e-mails?  
A: Yes, we may. You can access our privacy statement from the gm.com website and opt out of unsolicited marketing e-mails. If you have subscribed to a particular e-mail newsletter or other communication (e.g., My GMLINK Service Reminders, etc.), you should follow the instructions in the e-mail or on their website to unsubscribe. You must contact your dealer separately.

  
Q8: How do I opt out of receiving unsolicited marketing communications from GM or change my opt-out preferences?  
A: If you do not want to receive unsolicited marketing communications from GM or GM business units, please visit our Consumer Preference System website. This will allow you to opt out of telephone and e-mail communications and/or to change previously submitted opt-out preferences. You can also call 1-866-MYPRIVACY (1-866-697-7482) to opt out of direct mail communications, as well as telephone and e-mail communications, and/or to change previously submitted opt-out preferences.

  
Q9: How long will my opt-out preferences last?  
A: Your GM telephone opt-out preferences will expire five (5) years from the date you submit them. Your GM direct mail opt-out preferences will expire two (2) years from the date of your submission. At this time your e-mail opt-out preferences will not expire. You can change or update your opt-out preferences by clicking here.

  
Q10: How will you obtain my permission to disclose information about me to a third party?  
A: An example is information you provide in a BRC (Business Reply Card). We identify the third party on the card and ask for your permission to share that data with them.

  
Q11: Does my vehicle have a black box to record data?  
A: GM vehicles, like other modern motor vehicles, have a number of sophisticated computer systems that monitor and control several aspects of the vehicle's performance. GM vehicles use on-board vehicle computers to monitor emission control components to optimize fuel economy, to monitor conditions for air bag deployment and, if so equipped, to provide anti-lock braking and to help the driver control the vehicle in difficult driving situations. Some information may be stored during regular operations to facilitate repair of detected malfunctions. other information is stored only in a crash event by computer systems, such as those commonly called event data recorders (EDR).

  
Q12: Does my vehicle have an RFID feature that transmits my personal data?  
A: No, many GM vehicles contain sensing and transmitting devices using the same type of radio frequency transmission technology used in RFIDs that can contain personal information. These devices are used to perform functions such as checking tire pressure. The devices do not store or transmit personal data.
