#### Cookies/Tracking Technologies

GM may use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons and other tracking technologies on our websites, applications, email messages and advertisements, sometimes across devices, to gather information about your visit (such as demographic data, browser type, IP address, pages visited, activities conducted on the page, and the day and time of your visit). Using cookies provides benefits to you, such as allowing you to maintain your account login information or contact information on Request a Quote forms between visits or locating a nearby dealer. In addition, we use information gathered from cookies to autofill fields on forms such as the city, state or zip code associated with your IP address. This information can be corrected by you before submitting any form or inquiry or you can disable the cookie as discussed below and the information will not be collected.

We place pixel tags and web beacons in our emails to measure the effectiveness of our email campaigns by identifying the individuals who open or act upon an email message, when an email message is opened, how many times an email message is forwarded, the type of software, device, operating system and browser used to deliver the email and any URL accessed through our email message.

To measure site activity, provide a better user experience, and tailor our marketing communications, we or our service providers or companies we do business with may compile information from the cookies, pixel tags, web beacons or other technologies on our websites.  This information may be combined with other information collected online or offline about you, including data provided by third party sources, and may be used or shared for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement.  We may also allow third party advertising and personalization companies to use this information to develop personalized content and appropriate advertising based on your visits over time on GM web sites and non-GM web sites.  This information may also be used to evaluate our online advertising campaigns or to tailor promotions and other marketing messages to you across your devices.

At this time, we do not honor “do not track” signals if enabled in a web browser.  

You may choose to decline or delete some or all of the cookies that we use on our websites; however, doing so may impair the functionality of our websites.  Please refer your web browser’s settings or help features to learn more about cookies and other technologies and how to manage their use. If you elect to refuse or delete cookies, you will need to repeat this process if you use another computer or device or change web browsers.

GM adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising ([www.AboutAds.info](https://www.aboutads.info/)). If you do not wish to receive personalized advertising or content from us while visiting GM web sites, you may click on the AdChoices icon and/or link located at the bottom of the web site page or the [Digital Advertising Alliance’s Opt-Out page](http://www.aboutads.info/choices), where applicable. If you do not wish to receive personalized advertising or content from us on non-GM websites, please visit the [Digital Advertising Alliance’s Opt-Out page](http://www.aboutads.info/choices) or click on the AboutAds icon on a GM advertisement and follow the instructions on how to opt out. Opting out of relevant advertising will not opt you out of all advertising, but rather only those advertisements that are personalized to your interests by GM or its agents or representatives.

#### Mobile Applications

GM may offer certain mobile applications that you have the option to download to or use with your connected device or vehicle (“GM Applications”). When you choose to download or use a GM Application, there may be an opportunity for you to provide us with, or for us to obtain, information about you, your connected device, or your vehicle. Each GM Application may display a separate privacy statement that will inform you about how any information is collected, used and shared via the application and how to decline such use or uninstall the application.

#### Biometric Technology

Instead of being asked security questions, we may offer voice verification services when you contact our call centers. If you consent to use this service, we will use a mathematical model when you speak to a call center Advisor to compare your voice in real-time against a voice print provided during enrollment.  If we detect a match, you may be automatically authenticated and may not have to provide a PIN or answer account security questions.

For your security:

* Voice biometric data is only used to confirm your identity when you contact a participating call center.
* Voice biometric data will not be sold or shared without your consent.
* When we use your voice to create a voiceprint, we will encrypt your biometric data so that it cannot be used by third parties.
* If you opt-out or close your account, we will delete your biometric data.

#### Third Party Services, Applications, and Websites

Through the use of GM products and services, you may be able to access third party services, applications, and websites not offered or controlled by GM (“Third Party Services”). We recommend that you carefully review the privacy disclosures of these Third-Party Services, before interacting with them or providing your personal information to them. Unless otherwise expressly indicated by GM, this Privacy Statement does not apply to your use of such Third Party Services or how such Third Party Services may collect, use, or share your information**.**

#### GM Dealers

GM and dealers that sell GM vehicles are separate legal entities with their own privacy practices. This Privacy Statement does not apply to a dealer’s collection, use, or sharing of your information. For questions about your dealer's privacy practices including opting out of marketing communications from your dealer, please contact your dealer directly.

When you buy or lease a vehicle from, or sign a service repair order with, a GM dealer, the dealer may share your information with GM for use by GM in accordance with this Privacy Statement. We recommend that you read your dealer’s privacy disclosures to ensure that you understand its privacy practices, including how your dealer shares your information with GM. Additionally, because your dealer often is the first contact with you, your dealer can answer any questions you may have about your dealer’s privacy practices. Although GM encourages dealers to ensure full compliance with all applicable privacy law and may provide dealers with information relating to their respective privacy obligations, GM is not responsible for dealers’ compliance with applicable law.
