### Google Tag Manager Use Policy

Use of the Google Tag Manager (the “**Service**”) is subject to this Google Tag Manager Use Policy (the “**GTM Use Policy**”).

If You use the Service to support products or services from a 3rd party or designed by You (together, “**3rd Party Tags**”) or Google, You will have and abide by an appropriate privacy policy and will comply with [the EU user consent policy](https://www.google.com/about/company/user-consent-policy.html) (located at [https://www.google.com/about/company/user-consent-policy.html](https://www.google.com/about/company/user-consent-policy.html)) and all applicable agreements and regulations (also relating to the collection of information), including for example:

*   the Google Analytics Terms of Service located at: [https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html](https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html),
*   the agreement between You and Google that is in effect during the dates that You are participating in the Service, and
*   the [Google LLC Advertising Program Terms](https://billing.google.com/payments/paymentsinfofinder) (or, if applicable, as negotiated).

If You have 3rd Party Tags delivered through the Service:

*   Google is not responsible for 3rd Party Tags.
*   Google may screen such 3rd Party Tags to ensure compliance with this GTM Use Policy.
*   You guarantee that You have the rights to upload the 3rd Party Tags.

    1.  to engage in or promote any unlawful, infringing, defamatory or otherwise harmful activity;
    2.  to disable, interfere with or circumvent any aspect of the Service;
    3.  to upload any data to Google Tag Manager that personally identifies an individual (such as a name, email address or billing information), or other data which can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, or
    4.  to access any other Google product or service in a manner that violates their respective terms.
