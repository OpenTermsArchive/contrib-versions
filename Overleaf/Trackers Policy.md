### What is a cookie?

A "cookie" is a text file that websites send to a visitor's computer or other Internet-connected device. Each cookie is unique and can be used to identify or store information, e.g. it can allow a website to identify a visitor, track a visitor’s actions and/or remember a visitor’s preferences.

Cookies are often referred to as session-based (which only last whilst your browser is open and are erased after you close your browser) or persistent (which remain on your device until you or your browser delete them or they expire after a pre-defined period of time).
