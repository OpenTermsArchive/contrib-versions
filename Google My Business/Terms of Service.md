Google Business Profile Additional Terms of Service for Business Entities
=========================================================================

**Last modified:** 1 May 2023

The Google Business Profile Services allow business entities to create and manage a business profile on Google ('Business Profile').

To use the Google Business Profile Services and any related services, features and functionality (the 'Business Profile Services'), a business entity must accept (1) the Google Terms of Service, and (2) these Google Business Profile Additional Terms of Service (the 'Google Business Profile Additional Terms'). Together, these documents are known as the 'Terms'. The individual accepting the Terms for the business entity must be an authorised representative of the business entity listed on the Business Profile.

Please read the Terms carefully. They establish what you can expect from us as you use Business Profile Services and what we expect from you. As used in these Google Business Profile Additional Terms, 'you' means the business entity using the Business Profile Services.

If these Google Business Profile Additional Terms conflict with [the Google Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms), these Business Profile Additional Terms will govern for Business Profile Services.

What we expect from you
-----------------------

You’re responsible for the entity listed on your Business Profile. That means, in addition to following the basic rules of conduct in [the Google Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms), you must, when using the Business Profile Services:

* Comply with applicable laws and industry best practices when operating and promoting your entity, including obtaining all applicable licences and approvals.
* Ensure that your content is correct, up to date and complete.
* Supply all required disclaimers, warnings and notices (or if you rely on any supplied by Google, ensure their sufficiency for your entity).
* Comply with [these policies](https://support.google.com/business/answer/7667250) which apply to the Business Profile Services.

Moderation of your content and other content on the Business Profile
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Google is not responsible for your Business Profile. But, once you’ve claimed it, you understand that we have the right, but not the obligation, to moderate the content you provide using Business Profile Services.

We’re constantly striving to ensure that information in your Business Profile is complete, relevant and up to date so that the business details displayed on Google are as useful as possible for you and our users. This means that, occasionally, we may choose not to display your content (for example, if trusted signals indicate that your content is not accurate). We may also choose to show an edited version of your content or content from an alternative source in place of your content.
