Google Business Profile Additional Terms of Service
===================================================

**Last modified:** 4 November 2021

To use Google Business Profile or any related services, features and functionality (the 'Google Business Profile Services'), you must accept (1) [the Google Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms), and (2) these Business Profile Additional Terms of Service (the 'Google Business Profile Additional Terms').

Please read each of these documents carefully. Together, these documents are known as the 'Terms'. They establish what you can expect from us as you use Business Profile Services and what we expect from you.

If these Google Business Profile Additional Terms conflict with [the Google Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms), these Business Profile Additional Terms will govern for Business Profile Services.

**Important:** As a COVID-19 precaution, we're operating with a limited team. It may take longer than usual to connect with us. We recommend our [Help Community](https://support.google.com/business/community) and [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/GoogleMyBusinessHelp/featured).

What we expect from you
-----------------------

You’re responsible for the entity listed on your profile (your 'Business Profile'). That means, in addition to following the basic rules of conduct in [the Google Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms), you must, when using the Business Profile Services:

*   Comply with applicable laws and industry best practices when operating and promoting your entity, including obtaining all applicable licences and approvals.
*   Ensure that your content is correct, up to date and complete.
*   Supply all required disclaimers, warnings and notices (or if you rely on any supplied by Google, ensure their sufficiency for your entity).
*   Comply with [these policies](https://support.google.com/business/answer/7667250) which apply to the Business Profile Services.

Moderation of your content and other content on the Business Profile
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Google is not responsible for your Business Profile or the entity listed on your profile. But, once you’ve claimed it, you understand that we have the right, but not the obligation, to moderate the content that you provide using Business Profile Services.

We’re constantly striving to ensure that information in your Business Profile is complete, relevant and up to date so that the business details displayed on Google are as useful as possible for you and our users. This means that, occasionally, we may choose not to display your content (for example, if trusted signals indicate that your content is not accurate). We may also choose to show an edited version of your content or content from an alternative source in place of your content. [Learn more about how Google sources and displays information in Business Profiles](https://support.google.com/business/answer/2721884).

Your access to your content

You’ll maintain access to your content in Business Profile Services in accordance with the functionality described [here](https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063). You can [download a copy of your content](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3024190) at any time.

Although it’s not a part of these Terms, we encourage you to read [our Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) to better understand how you can [update, manage, export and delete your information](https://myaccount.google.com/).

Google’s access to your account
-------------------------------

If you authorise us to do so, we may access your account to help you manage your Business Profile and account.

Relationship
------------

You must be the owner of the entity listed on your profile or an authorised representative able to bind others on behalf of that entity.

Binding others
--------------

You must bind any users who manage or later own your Business Profile to these terms before making them managers or owners.

Changes to the Terms
--------------------

If we materially change the Terms, we’ll give you no less than 15 days advance notice if required by applicable law.

Licence
-------

This licence covers the basic Business Profile information about your entity that you provide, if that information is protected by intellectual property rights.

You give Google a perpetual (which means for as long as that information is protected by intellectual property rights), irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free and non-exclusive licence to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display, distribute and create derivative works of the basic Business Profile information about your entity that you provide (such as the entity name, location, phone number, category, hours and website).

You also grant to other Google services users the right to access and use, including the right to edit, that information as permitted under the applicable Google Terms of Service.

All other content that you provide to your profile (such as business photos) is licensed to Google under the [Google Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms).

Other products and services
---------------------------

You may be provided access to other products and services within your account. These products and services may be subject to their own separate terms and policies that we will make available to you.

Settle disputes
---------------

If you’re a business user based in the EU or the United Kingdom, you can also apply to resolve a dispute under these Terms with mediation. Find more details about the mediators that we're willing to engage with and instructions about how to [request mediation here](http://g.co/help/mediation). Except as required by applicable law, mediation is voluntary and neither you nor Google are obliged to settle disputes through mediation.

Before moving to terminate the Terms, we’ll give you no less than 30 days advance notice if required by applicable law.
