Where/How Do Our Brands Collect Personal Information?
-----------------------------------------------------

We collect personal information about you from a number of sources:

**From You**. Some of our Brands collect your contact, registration/account information, payment information, and any other personal information when you provide it to us on the Services. When you make a purchase on the Services, we also retain a record of your purchases and order history.

**From Your Device.**

_**What Are Cookies and Other Technologies?**_

*   **Cookies**: A “cookie” is a tiny file that’s stored on your computer. It contains a unique identifier, as well as the address and other information about the website you are visiting. Cookies help us know whether you are a returning visitor to our Services. For example, although you may not log in when you visit our Services, we can use cookies to recognize that you have visited that website in the past. By using cookies, we are able to understand what is of interest to our customers and ensure the content and services we offer are relevant and compelling when you visit our Services. In some cases, we may use the personal information we collect from cookies to deliver relevant and compelling content to you when you visit the Services.
*   **Web Beacons, Pixel Tags, and Other Tracking Technologies.** Web beacons, pixel tags, and other tracking technologies are small strings of code placed on a web page or in an e-mail or advertisement. These technologies allow your browser to recognize and store certain types of information such as cookies previously set, the time and date that you viewed the page with the beacon, and a description of that page.

_**Can You Opt Out?**_

In most cases, yes! There are some cookies that we need in order to operate the Services. If you delete those cookies, the Services would no longer function (as an example, if we can’t remember the items you put in a shopping cart, then you won’t be able to place an order on the Services). You can always decide to opt out of or delete the third-party cookies (cookies set by advertisers and data partners) on our Services. Keep in mind, if you block cookies, you may not be able to view or access some of the features of our Services. Visit our section on your [privacy choices](#section5) for more information on how to opt out.

**From Others.**

*   **Advertisers.** In some cases, the advertisers that serve ads on our Services will share your e-mail or online identifiers with us so that we can make sure their advertisements or offers reach you.
*   **Data Partners**. We work with third-party data partners who share personal information with us, including your demographic information, internet activity information, purchasing information, and interests, preferences, and other behavioral data, which help us understand you better and ensure the content and services we offer are relevant and compelling. 
*   **Service Providers**. We work with service providers that collect personal information on our behalf in order to provide services to us, such as hosting our websites, processing our credit card transactions, fulfilling your subscriptions and orders, verifying your identity, and other activities needed to help us provide our content and services to you. We only allow our service providers to use your personal information in connection with the services they provide us.

Who Do Our Brands Share Personal Information With?
--------------------------------------------------

We may share your personal information with our other Meredith Companies, service providers, social media platforms, advertisers, and third-party data partners.

*   **National Media Group Brands**. We share your information with other National Media Group Brands. The Brands covered by this Privacy Statement share your personal information with each other and will use that information as described in this Privacy Statement.
*   **Meredith Companies**. Our Brands also share your personal information with other businesses owned by the [Meredith](https://www.meredith.com/) Corporation, which have their own privacy statements and are not subject to this Privacy Statement.
*   **Service Providers**. We engage service providers to provide services such as credit-card and billing processing, shipping, marketing, advertising optimization and interest-based targeting, e-mail and text message distribution, data processing, mobile and website analytics, user authentication, security, and promotions management. We may share any personal information we collect about you with these service providers and authorize them to collect personal information from you directly to support the services they provide to us. We do not authorize our service providers to share or use your personal information with any other third parties.
*   **Social Media Platforms**. To make your experience with our Services more enjoyable, we may offer features made available by social media platforms (such as likes or social sharing). Some social media platforms may collect personal information directly from you pursuant to their own separate privacy policies, which may differ from ours. Some social media platforms also act as our data partners, which means that we may share your personal information with them as described below under “Data Partners.”
*   **Advertisers**. We are able to provide most of our Services and other content to you for free with the help of the advertisers who promote their products and services on our Services. Brands with ad-supported Services share aggregate visitor information with advertisers, including information about your demographics, internet activity information, interests, and preferences. In some cases, we share contact information (such as your name, age, and/or e-mail address) or online identifiers with these advertisers. If you sign up for a special e-mail offer from one of our advertisers, our Brands will also share your e-mail address and any other personal information you provided with your request with the advertisers you selected.
*   **Data Partners**. Some of our Brands provide select third-party data partners with lists of our user e-mail addresses in a hashed, encrypted, or anonymized form that they use to recognize you. These data partners will provide us with additional personal information about you (such as your interests, preferences, or demographic information). Other data partners use cookies and other tracking technologies to enable the delivery of interest-based advertising to users. We do not authorize our data partners to share your e-mail address with their other clients.
*   **Legal Compliance, Business Transfers, and Other Disclosures**. We disclose personal information about users of our Services when we believe the law requires it. For example, to respond to compulsory process or law enforcement requests, to enforce our terms of service for relevant brands, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of users, the public, Meredith Companies, service providers, social media platforms, advertisers, data partners, or third parties. Over time, we may reorganize or transfer various assets and lines of business. We reserve the right to disclose or transfer any personal information we collect to third parties in connection with any proposed or actual purchase, sale, lease, merger, foreclosure, liquidation, amalgamation, or any other type of acquisition, disposal, transfer, conveyance, or financing of all or any portion of Meredith companies.

**What Other Choices Do You Have?**

To remove your name and postal address from lists that we sell or rent to third parties for their direct marketing purposes, or to opt out of receiving marketing offers for other Meredith magazines and products by mail, please use the opt-out form available [here](https://www.meredith.com/offlinePrivacy.html) or send your request to us in a letter addressed to Meredith Corporation, Opt-Out Postal, Attn: Circulation, 1716 Locust Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50309.

**Opt Out of Cookies and Other Technologies.**

There are a few ways to opt out of or delete cookies:

*   **On Your Browser (Chrome, Safari, etc.)**. The settings of the browser you use give you an option to accept or reject most cookies, or to notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences). Please be aware that certain browsers cannot block or delete so-called Flash cookies, which use a feature of the Adobe Flash video player to store information on your computer. For information about how to delete Flash cookies, please visit the [Adobe website](https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html). This will opt you out of cookies on the browser you are using. If you use multiple browsers, you will need to take this step for all relevant browsers. Please note that denying all or certain cookies may result in a less personalized experience with some of the Services offered on the website.
*   **Opt Out on a Mobile Device**. Depending on your device and operating system, you may be able to reset your mobile device’s advertising identifier to limit this data collection, or prevent the collection of usage data across unaffiliated applications for interest-based advertising purposes, by accessing the privacy settings on your mobile device. Each operating system, iOS for Apple devices, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices, provides its own instructions. Visit the privacy settings for your mobile device or contact your platform operator for more information.
*   **Opt Out of Nielsen’s Tracking Technologies**. Some of our advertisers and Brands may use Nielsen’s measurement services, which contribute to market research, like Nielsen’s TV and Online Campaign Ratings service. Nielsen’s pixel may be in some of the ads on our Services and will record whether or not you viewed the ad. Nielsen uses the data it collects to create ratings reports for advertisers and publishers. For more information about Nielsen’s information collection practices and any related opt-out choices, please see the [Nielsen.com privacy policy](https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/legal/privacy-statement).

**Opt Out of Interest-Based Advertising.**

We follow the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“**DAA**”) Self-Regulatory Principles (“Principles”) for Online Behavioral advertising.

*   To opt out of our use of your website viewing data to serve interest-based advertising on the websites of other companies and e-mail newsletters, visit the [DAA’s Consumer Choice Page](http://optout.aboutads.info/).
*   You can also click on the Ad Choices located in the footers of our webpages and navigate to the consumer opt-out form.
*   Most of the third-party advertising and data companies we work with, including DoubleClick and Google, also subscribe to the DAA Principles and/or are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). To learn more about the information-collection practices of [NAI members](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/) and your related opt-out choices, please visit the NAI’s website.
*   You must opt out separately from each computer or device and browser that you use to access our Services, and if you clear your cookies, you will need to repeat the opt-out process.

\*\*Note that many of our websites allow you to adjust your cookie preferences by clicking on the “Ad Choices” link in the footers of our webpages.

**Mobile App Advertising and Tracking.**

Some of our Brands may collect personal information from your mobile device, including unique advertising identifiers and the names and IDs of apps you have installed, as well as information about how you use our mobile applications and other unaffiliated applications. We and our partners use this personal information to enable interest-based advertising you receive through our Services and within third-party apps and other marketing channels.

![Child Icon](http://images.meredith.com/privacy/6.png)

Children’s Privacy
------------------

National Media Group Brands do not knowingly allow anyone under the age of 16 to provide us with any personal information online. Children should always get permission from their parents before sharing any personal information about themselves over the internet. If you’re under 16, please do not register for the Services or provide us with any personal information.

### Additional Privacy Information

*   **Contests and Other Co-Sponsored Promotions**. From time to time, we may offer contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions. Participation in these promotions may require registration on our Services. We may share your registration information with co-sponsors or other third parties involved in the promotion that we identify in the rules or entry materials. We don't control these third parties’ privacy practices, and our Privacy Statement does not apply to their collection and use of your personal information. We may also share some of your entry information with third parties or the public in connection with the administration of the promotion, such as winner selection and prize fulfillment, and as permitted by the promotion’s official rules, such as on list of winners.
*   **Security, Retention, and Storage of Personal Information**. We use commercially reasonable procedures to protect the personal information that we collect. However, we cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that personal information you supply won’t be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the internet. Please see our terms of service for the relevant brand for more information related to posting materials on our Services, including our use of such materials.
*   **Location of Your Data**. Meredith is a U.S. company and your personal information will be transferred to, processed, stored, and accessed by us, the Meredith Companies, and service providers in the United States and in other jurisdictions where we or they operate, which may not provide you with the same level of privacy protection as you are entitled to in your jurisdiction. When you visit our Services or use our Brands, you consent to the processing of your personal information in the United States and other jurisdictions as described here.
*   **EU-U.S. Privacy Shield**. Meredith adheres to the principles of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (“Privacy Shield Principles”) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union (“EU”) to the United States; however, we do not rely on the Privacy Shield Principles when we transfer or receive personal information transferred from the EU. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Statement and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles will govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, please visit the [Privacy Shield website](https://www.privacyshield.gov/).

Meredith is responsible for the processing of personal information it receives under the Privacy Shield Principles or subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Meredith complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers from the EU and European Economic Area (“EEA”), including onward transfer liability provisions.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Meredith’s compliance with its obligations under the Privacy Shield Principles. In certain situations, Meredith may be required to disclose personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Meredith commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. EU individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact us at [privacy@meredith.com](mailto:privacy@meredith.com).

Meredith has further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to JAMS, an established alternative dispute-resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not resolved your complaint, please contact or visit [JAMS](https://www.jamsadr.com/) or call 800-352-5267 to file a complaint. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing, and/or other fees and you cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Meredith will pay them for you.

*   **Changes to Our Privacy Statement**. Digital technology is rapidly evolving. If we decide to change our Privacy Statement in the future, we’ll post the changes here and indicate at the top of the page the last date on which it was updated. Unless otherwise noted, all changes will be effective when posted.
