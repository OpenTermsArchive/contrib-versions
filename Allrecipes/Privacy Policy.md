#### **Third-Party Sources**

We also obtain personal information from third parties, which we often combine with personal information we collect either automatically or directly from an individual.  For example, we may receive the same categories of personal information described above from the following third parties:

⠀⠀⠀● **Other Users who Interact with our Services**:  We may receive your information from other users who interact with our Services.

⠀⠀⠀● **Business Partners**:  We may receive your information from our business partners, such as companies that offer their products or services on our Services or on other properties (e.g., digital properties, offline locations) or marketing/advertising and analytics partners, including third-party brands/agencies or other partners that facilitate the buying and selling of advertising inventory on our Services, measure of the effectiveness of those related ad campaigns, or inform business analytics (e.g., view rates, bounce rates, audience composition).

⠀⠀⠀● **Social Media Networks**:  When an individual interacts with our Services through various social media networks, such as when someone logs in through a social network, “Likes” us on Facebook, or follows us or shares our content on Google, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or other social networks, we may receive some information from those social networks including your profile information and any other information you permit the social network to share with third parties.  We use this information to allow you to log into your account, to communicate or interact with individuals on the social network, to better understand the demographics of our visitors, and to personalize content and advertising.  Individuals should always review and, if necessary, adjust their privacy settings on third-party websites and social media networks and services before sharing information or linking or connecting them to other services.

### **What are Our Third-Party Data Collection and Online Advertising Practices?**

#### **General**

We, and our third-party partners, use information that we receive about you (e.g., that you provide to us or about your use of the Services, or that we receive from third parties) to serve advertisements more relevant to your interests, the content on which the ads will appear, or audiences similar to you, to optimize marketing and advertising campaigns more broadly, as well as to generate analytics and provide marketing/advertising-related services such as reporting, market research, and measurement/attribution. These third-party partners may include online advertising networks or exchanges, measurement/attribution companies, ad fraud verification companies, social media companies, or other advertising technology services (e.g., demand-side or sell-side platforms, ad servers, clean room providers).

#### **How We Collect This Information**

The information used for these advertising practices is typically collected through tracking technologies, such as cookies, web beacons/pixels, SDKs, APIs, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, logging technologies, and similar technologies, which recognize the device you are using and collect information, including clickstream information, browser type, time and date you visited the Sites, mobile ad ID or other digital identifier (e.g., iOS IDFA, Google AAID, cookie ID, click ID, other proprietary IDs such as open-source “universal IDs” or other ID solutions), geolocation, and other information, such as the advertising/advertising measurement data discussed further above in this Privacy Policy. These tools may also collect other information you provide to us or other information about how you use the Services, such as your mouse movements, scrolling, clicks, and keystroke activity on the Services and other browsing, search, or purchasing behavior. These tools may also record information you enter when you interact with our Services or engage in chat or other features through our Service.

We may share a common account identifier (such as a hashed or encrypted email address or user ID) or other information (such as phone number, which also is typically provided in hashed or encrypted format) with our third-party advertising partners to help identify you across devices. We may share this information using mechanisms such as API, direct file upload, server-to-server transfer, or integrating the tracking technologies of those partners (e.g., pixel).

#### **How To Exercise Your Choices Regarding Online Ads**

Please see the “**[What Controls Do I Have Over My Information?](https://www.dotdashmeredith.com/brands-privacy#TextBlockOneColumn-7)**” section below to learn how you can opt out of interest-based advertising.

#### **More On Social Media Platforms and Advertising**

Our Services may include social media features, such as the Facebook “Like” button, Pinterest, Instagram, Twitter, or other widgets. These social media companies may recognize you and collect information about your visit to our Services, and they may set a cookie or employ other tracking technologies. Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of those companies.

We display targeted advertising to you through social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and other social media platforms.  For example, these companies have interest-based advertising programs that allow us to direct advertisements to users who have shown interest in our services while those users are on the social media platform, or to groups of other users who share similar traits, such as likely commercial interests and demographics.  As mentioned in the section above, we may share a unique identifier, such as a user ID or hashed or encrypted email address or phone number, with these platform providers or they may collect information from our website visitors through a pixel (or other mechanism, such as API, direct file upload, or server-to-server integration), in order to direct targeted advertising to you or to a custom audience (including “look-a-like” audiences, such as audiences that are similar to you or other users) on the social media platform.  These advertisements are governed by the privacy policies of those social media companies that provide them.  If you do not want to receive targeted ads on your social networks, you may be able to adjust your advertising preferences through your settings on those networks.

LiveRamp uses this information to create an online identification code that we may store in our first-party cookie for our use in online, in-app, and cross-channel advertising. This may be shared with advertising companies to enable interest-based and targeted advertising.

Please note that when you opt out of receiving interest-based advertisements, this does not mean you will no longer see advertisements from us (or our third-party partners) or on our online services in general. It means that the online ads that you do see from self-regulatory program participants (or other participants that may provide an opt-out mechanism) should not be based on your interests. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third parties’ opt-out options or programs, or the accuracy of their statements regarding those options or programs. In addition, third parties may still use cookies or other tracking technologies to collect information about your use of our online services, including for analytics and fraud prevention as well as any other purpose permitted under those self-regulatory programs.

The term “**State Privacy Laws**” means, as applicable, the U.S. state privacy laws that govern the processing of consumers’ personal information generally (e.g., the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “**CCPA**”), Colorado Privacy Act, Connecticut Data Privacy Act, Utah Consumer Privacy Act, Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act).

#### **Your Privacy Rights**

Depending on your state of residency, you may exercise the following rights under the State Privacy Laws in relation to the personal information about you that we have collected about you (subject to certain limitations under such laws, such as exceptions in the State Privacy Laws or the inability to verify your identity):

**The Right to Access**

Under the State Privacy Laws, you have the right to obtain confirmation regarding whether we are processing your personal information and to access that personal information and, in some cases, information about the third parties who may receive such personal information. You also have the right to access that personal information in a portable, readily usable format, unless not technically feasible to provide in such a format. 

Specifically with respect to the CCPA’s right to access, you have the right to request the following: (a) the specific pieces of personal information the business has collected about you and (b) the categories of personal information collected, the sources of collection, the business/commercial purpose for collecting or "selling/sharing" personal information, and the categories of third party to whom the business discloses personal information.

**The Right to Deletion**

You have the right to request the deletion of PI we have collected from you, subject to certain exceptions under the State Privacy Laws.

**The Right to Correction**

You have the right to request that inaccuracies in your PI be corrected, taking into account the nature of the personal information and the purposes of the processing of your personal information.

**Opt-Out Rights**

Under State Privacy Laws, you have the right to opt-out of “sales” and “shares” of personal information, “targeted advertising,” and certain use/disclosure of “sensitive” personal information.  

As further described in this Privacy Policy, we disclose the following to our advertising/marketing and analytics partners (e.g., advertisers/agencies, social media networks, adtech partners, customer intelligence firms) for advertising and marketing purposes, including direct marketing: Identifiers, commercial information, geolocation data, internet or other network information, and data that may be considered “sensitive” personal information under certain State Privacy Laws. Please see our “Your Privacy Choices” link (found in the website footer) to exercise your opt-out rights accordingly.

We do not have actual knowledge of “selling” or “sharing” PI of consumers under sixteen (16) years of age.

#### **To Exercise Your Privacy Rights**

To submit a request to exercise your right to access, deletion, or correction, please use [this form](https://privacyportalde-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/2159c482-749a-49db-916b-475017a9efa5/ac1b3f16-60f7-4795-aca2-2240267ed067.html). You may also email [privacy@dotdashmdp.com](mailto:privacy@dotdashmdp.com) for assistance on exercising rights requests (where State Privacy Laws require that we provide another means for such assistance). 

To exercise your right to opt-out of "sales," "shares," ”targeted advertising,” or certain use/disclosure of “sensitive” personal information, please click our **Your Privacy Choices** link (found in the website footer) and follow the instructions therein. As discussed in such link, you may also visit our website with the Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal enabled to opt-out of “sales/shares” via Targeting Cookies (learn more about GPC at [www.globalprivacycontrol.org](http://www.globalprivacycontrol.org/)). The Targeting Cookies opt-out is on a per-website basis and applies at the browser level for the device you use to opt out.  

Unless otherwise prohibited by the State Privacy Laws, we may need to verify your identity and confirm your residency before processing your request.  In order to verify your identity, we will generally either require the successful authentication of your account or the matching of sufficient information you provide us to the information we maintain about you in our systems.  This process may require us to request additional personal information from you, including, but not limited to, your email address, phone number, or date of last transaction on our Services.

In certain circumstances, we may decline a request to exercise the rights described above, particularly where we are unable to verify your identity or locate your information in our systems.  If we cannot comply with a request, we will explain the reasons in our response.

**Non-Discrimination and Appeals**

You have the right to not receive “discriminatory” treatment for exercising the rights discussed in the table above.  However, please note that if the exercise of these rights limits our ability to process personal information (such as in the case of a deletion request), we may no longer be able to provide you our products and services or engage with you in the same manner.

Further, under certain State Privacy Laws, you may appeal our decision to not take action on your rights request. All appeals should be submitted by emailing [privacy@dotdashmdp.com](about:blank), along with a copy of the decision that you are appealing.

**Authorized Agents**

In certain circumstances under the State Privacy Laws, you are permitted to use an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf (using the mechanisms for submitting requests above), to the extent we can verify the authorized agent’s authority to act on your behalf.

For requests to access, delete, or correct personal information, we may require the following for verification purposes:

(a) a power of attorney from you or your authorized agent that is valid under the laws of the applicable state where you reside; or

(b) sufficient evidence to show that you have:

1. provided the authorized agent signed permission to act on your behalf; and  
      
    
2. verified your own identity directly with us or directly confirmed with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request on your behalf.

For requests to opt-out of “sales,” “shares,” or the processing of your personal information for “targeted advertising” under the State Privacy Laws, we may require a signed permission demonstrating your authorized agent has been authorized by you to act on your behalf.

**Deidentified Information**

Where we process “deidentified information” (as such term is defined under the State Privacy Laws) and are required to keep such information deidentified, we commit to maintain and use the information in deidentified form and will not attempt to reidentify the information, except in instances where necessary for determining whether the deidentification process we used satisfies the requirements under applicable law.

● Each price or service difference related to the collection and use of personal information is based upon our reasonable, good-faith determination of the estimated value of such information to our business, such as by calculating the expense related to the offer, provision, or imposition of the financial incentive or price or service difference or revenue generation or expense related to the sale, collection, or retention of consumers’ personal information.
