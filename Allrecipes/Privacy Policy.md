**From your Device.**

**_What are Cookies & Other Technologies?_**

§ **Cookies.** A “cookie” is a tiny file that’s stored on your computer. It contains a unique identifier, as well as the address and other information about the website you are visiting.  Cookies help us know whether you are a returning visitor to our Sites.  For example, although you may not log-in when you visit our Sites, we can use cookies to recognize that you have visited the Site in the past. By using cookies, we are able to understand what is of interest to our customers and ensure the content and services we offer are relevant and compelling when you visit our Sites.  In some cases, we may use the information we collect from cookies, to deliver relevant and compelling content to you when you visit the Sites.

**_Can You Opt Out?_**

In most cases, yes!  There are some cookies that we need in order to operate the Sites.  If you deleted those cookies, the Sites would no longer function (as an example, if we can’t remember the items you put in a shopping cart, then you won’t be able to place an order on the Sites).  You can always decide to opt-out of or delete the third party cookies (cookies set by Advertisers and Data Partners) on our Sites.  Keep in mind, if you block cookies, you may not be able to view or access some of the features of our Sites.  Visit our section on your [privacy choices](#_How_Can_You) for more information on how to opt-out.
