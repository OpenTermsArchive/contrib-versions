4\. Payments

All our paid Services are subscribed on a service period basis. You choose the service period and the payment method yourself when you sign up for the paid Services. Your service will automatically be renewed, and your chosen payment method will be charged at the end of each service period, unless you decide to cancel your automatic payments for the Services before the end of the then-current subscription. All prices, including recurring subscription fees, are subject to change. Any changes in pricing will be communicated to you in advance. If you update payment details in your account, the updated information will be regarded as your preferred method for any future payments.

In some cases, we or others on our behalf may offer a free trial for our paid Services. The duration of the free trial period and other details will be specified during a sign-up. We determine your free trial eligibility at our sole discretion, and to the extent permitted under applicable law we may limit or withdraw a free trial option at any time without prior notice. You acknowledge and agree that we will automatically charge you for our paid Services at the end of the free trial period on a recurring basis. If you do not want to be charged, you must cancel the paid subscription before the end of the free trial by contacting our support team. If you received a free trial from a third party, you may also cancel the paid subscription through that third party.

Only basic payment information is processed through our payment service providers and payment processing partners authorized to provide services within respective country (e.g., payments for the EU are processed by Mollymind AG, registered at Neugasse 23, 6300 Zug, Switzerland and by Moonflash Limited, registered at Regent House, 316 Beulah Hill, London, United Kingdom, SE19 3HF. For the US – Lagosec, Inc. registered at 2035 Sunset Lake Rd., Suite B-2, Newark, Delaware, United States, DE 19702. Brazillian payments are processed by CYBERPOST INERMEDIACAO DE NEGOCIOS S.A, tax ID number (CNPJ), - 14.009.852/0001-54, registered at R Fernando Machado 73, Sala 203, Centro, Florianopolis, 88.010-510, SC).

Any fees charged by us are exclusive of taxes. However, we may calculate and add any taxes and / or additional fees, including, but not limited to sales tax, value added tax and other taxes or fees under laws applicable to you. Such taxes and fees will be calculated according to the billing information provided by you to Nord at the time of purchase.

5\. Refund and cancellation policy

If you wish to claim a refund, you can do so within 30 days following your purchase of our Services. We seek your full satisfaction with our Services. However, we would like to troubleshoot an issue you experience first. There are common service configuration issues that may hinder the Services for you, and we resolve most user issues encountered.

Subscriptions purchased via the iTunes/App Store are subject to iTunes/App Store refund policies. This means we cannot grant refunds if you purchased an app through iTunes/App Store – you will have to contact store support for that. Payments made using prepaid cards or gift cards will not be refunded. Nord cannot refund any purchases made from our resellers (Amazon, BestBuy, StackSocial, etc.). In this case, refunds are handled according to the terms of service of the reseller from which the product was purchased. For payments made in cryptocurrency, the equivalent amount in US Dollars will be refunded in the same cryptocurrency (based on the rate of exchange at the moment of refund).

You have a right to cancel your account at any time. You can cancel a recurring subscription from your Nord account, iTunes/App Store or Google Play Store. Canceled accounts will not be refunded for the unused part of the ongoing service period.

You can only get a refund for our Services twice. If you buy any of our Services again after that, you will not be granted a refund for any further cancellation. We do not grant refunds for recurring subscription payments if you cancel the Services after the renewal, unless applicable law provides otherwise. No refunds will be considered for accounts terminated for violation of these Terms. Once the refund is issued to you, you will lose access to the Services.

6\. Minors

The Services are not directed to minors, and any use by minors should only be done with the guidance, supervision and consent of their parents or guardians. Further, we rely on parents and guardians to ensure minors only use the Services if they can understand their rights and responsibilities as stated in these Terms and our Privacy Policy.
