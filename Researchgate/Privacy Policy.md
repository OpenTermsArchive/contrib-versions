3.  **Information we automatically collect**We and service providers acting on our behalf store log files and use tracking technologies such as cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels, and local shared objects, also known as flash cookies, to collect information relating to you and your use of the Service."Cookies" are small files that enable us to store and collect specific information related to you and your use of the Service on your computer or other end devices. They help us to analyze the number of people who use the Service, usage frequency, User behavior, advertising effectiveness, to increase security and tailor our Service to your needs and preferences.After you have logged in to your account on the Service, we use so-called “session cookies” to identify you during the course of your session. Upon the termination of your session, the session cookie is automatically deleted.We also use "persistent cookies" to record information about repeat Users of the Service. Persistent cookies are designed to help us continually improve the products and services we offer you. Persistent cookies do not contain Personal Information such as your name, IP address, etc.You can edit the settings of your browser to prevent cookies from being stored, to limit the storage of cookies to certain websites, or such that your browser informs you every time a cookie is sent. You can also delete cookies from your computer’s hard drive at any time. However, please note that if cookies are deactivated you will not be able to take advantage of some of ResearchGate’s features.In addition to cookies, ResearchGate uses so-called pixels, web beacons, clear GIFs, and other similar mechanisms ("**Pixels**"). A Pixel is an image file or link to an image file added to the website code but not sent to your end device (e.g. PC, smartphone, etc.). Pixels are largely used for the same reasons as cookies, i.e. to analyze the number of people who use our Service or, if the User's email program allows HTML, to determine whether and when an email was opened. Pixels help us to check and optimize the effectiveness of our Service and offers as well as advertising campaigns served on ResearchGate. Pixels do not provide us with Personal Information and do not enable us to track Users. Pixels are usually used in conjunction with cookies. If you have deactivated the use of cookies in your browser, then Pixels will only report an anonymous website visit.We also use pixel-based and cookie-based conversion tracking technologies to, for example, measure the success of advertising campaigns served on ResearchGate. To this end we use technologies provided by Google.The information we automatically collect about you and your use of the Service includes:
    *   IP addresses;

4.  **Information about you from third parties**We receive information about you and your activities on and off the Service from third party partners, such as information from advertisers about your experience or interactions with them. We also obtain information about you from publicly available sources, such as information regarding previous research published by you and affiliations that may be associated with your profile.
5.  **Third party advertising including tailored advertising and analytics**We have advertising on our Service so we can continue to offer many of our features for free. We do not share Personal Information with third party advertisers for their direct marketing purposes unless you give us your prior consent.When advertisers or ad networks place advertisements on our Service, they may collect or we may share the following types of information from within our Service:
    
    *   performance data (such as the number of clicks on an advertisement);
    *   aggregated and/or de-identified information about you and other Users collectively that is not intended to specifically identify you (such as Users who live in Berlin);
    *   certain technical information (for example, IP addresses, non-persistent device identifiers such as Identifiers for Advertising (IDFAs), and de-identified persistent device identifiers such as a hashed Android ID). and
    *   other contextual data about your use of the Service (for example, your session length).
    
    Advertisers or ad networks may collect this information through the use of tracking technologies like browser cookies and web beacons (see explanations above), and they may use a single tracking technology or multiple tracking technologies at the same time.The information collected may be used to:
    *   measure how effective advertisements are;
    *   offer you targeted advertising in order to personalize your experience by showing you advertisements that are more relevant to you. and/or

ResearchGate cannot be responsible for any third party, or its affiliates or agents, failing to use your Personal Information in accordance with such third party's privacy policy, or any contractual or other legal obligations to which such third party, its affiliates or agents, may be subject.For more information about our use of cookies, and how to modify or delete them, see our Cookie Policy.
6.  **Use of Google services**ResearchGate reserves the right to use certain Google services, operated by Google, Inc., California, USA ("**Google**"). Google services may include Google Analytics, a web analytics service, Google Analytics Advertising Features, namely for remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting, and integrated services that require Google Analytics to collect data via advertising cookies and anonymous identifiers, and Google’s DoubleClick Services. Any information generated by the cookies about your use of the Service (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States of America.

Please see Google’s page on ‘How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps’, and Google’s terms and policies for further information.With respect to Google Analytics, the following additional safeguards apply: we have activated IP anonymization so that your IP address will be shortened by Google within the European Economic Area before the data is forwarded and stored in the USA. only in exceptional cases are IP addresses sent to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. Google will not combine your IP address collected via Google Analytics with other data that Google holds.To opt out from Google Analytics, please click here.If you are a Californian resident, please click here to limit Google’s ability to use your personal data for the serving of personalized ads.

Messages you initiate may also provide the recipient with aggregate information about your network (for example, how many people are in your network). Other communications that you initiate through the Service, like a request for a full-text, will list your name as the initiator but will not include your personal email address. Once you have connected with an individual, regardless of who sent the invitation, your contact information that you choose to include in your researcher profile will be shared with that individual.
