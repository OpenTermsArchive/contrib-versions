You hereby grant to Blizzard a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, fully paid up, non-exclusive, sub-licensable, right and license to exploit the User Content and all elements thereof, in any and all media, formats and forms, known now or hereafter devised.

Any such submission by you shall not create any contractual relationship between you and Blizzard. Except to the extent that any such waiver is prohibited by law, you hereby waive the benefit of any provision of law known as "moral rights" or "droit moral" or any similar law in any country of the world. You represent and warrant that the User Content does not infringe upon the copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret or other intellectual property rights of any third party. You further represent and warrant that you will not use or contribute User Content that is unlawful, tortious, defamatory, obscene, invasive of the privacy of another person, threatening, harassing, abusive, hateful, racist or otherwise objectionable or inappropriate. Blizzard may remove any User Content and any related content or elements from the Platform at its sole discretion.

Miscellaneous
-------------

No failure or forbearance on Blizzard’s part to exercise its rights or insist upon performance of your obligations hereunder is to be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of those or any other rights or obligations in that or any other instance; rather, the same shall remain in full force and effect.

If any provision of this Agreement is deemed unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, such provision shall be narrowed in scope or otherwise amended to the extent necessary to make such provision lawful, valid and enforceable while as nearly as possible reflecting the intent of the parties as expressed in this Agreement, or, if such amendment is impossible, severed from this Agreement. No amendment or severing of any provision of this Agreement shall affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining provisions.

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Blizzard relating to the subject matter hereof. Blizzard may, from time to time, change, modify or update this Agreement, and the revised Agreement will apply prospectively. For easier reference, Blizzard will change the “Last revised” date above.
