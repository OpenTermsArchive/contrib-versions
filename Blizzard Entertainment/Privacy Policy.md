5\. With whom may we share your information?
--------------------------------------------

Blizzard websites have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another. When posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, please be aware that the information is being made publicly available on-line and the user does so at his or her own risk. For certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below). Some of Blizzard’s products, services and features require that we share information with (1) our partners and service providers, (2) with other players and/or the general public, (3) with subsidiaries and affiliates, or (4) for legal reasons or in the event of a dispute.

1.  **With partners and service providers**. Blizzard may provide information to its vendors, consultants, marketing partners, research firms and other service providers or business partners. For example, we may provide information to such parties to help facilitate event ticket sales, conduct surveys on our behalf and process payments for our products and/or games. We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers, who create applications and websites that benefit our player community. You may opt out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of your Battle.net account.
2.  **With other players and/or the general public**. Information may be viewable by your friends, people in games, or the public in general if you play our games, use certain features in our games, use certain features on our platforms (such as chat applications in game or on the Battle.net platform) or make posts in the forums.
3.  **With subsidiaries and affiliates**. We share information with our subsidiaries and affiliates to help us provide our services or conduct personal information processing on our behalf. For example, Blizzard processes and stores information at Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. in the United States and may store or process personal information at Blizzard Entertainment SAS in France.
4.  **For legal reasons or in the event of a dispute**. Blizzard may share your information if we believe it is required by applicable law, regulation, operating agreement, legal process or governmental request. This includes sharing your information with law enforcement officials, government authorities or other third parties as necessary to enforce our End User Licence Agreement, user agreements or other policies to protect Blizzard’s rights or property or the rights or property of others, or in the event of a claim or dispute relating to your use of our services.

6\. International Transfer
--------------------------

Your information will be transferred to and processed in the United States where many of our central databases operate. The European Commission has not issued a decision confirming the United States to offer adequate protection for personal information. However, we use European Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses to protect your information. Where we share personal information with vendors, we use these clauses, or other appropriate legal mechanism, such as a vendor's Processor Binding Corporate Rules to protect your information. A copy of the relevant mechanism can be provided for your review on request to our Data Protection Officer using the details set out below.

7\. What rights do I have?
--------------------------

Access my personal information:

You may be able to receive a report about the personal information Blizzard stores about you. To learn more about accessing your personal information, please click on this [link](https://eu.battle.net/support/help/product/services/1327/1329).

Erasure:

You may have a right to request the deletion of some your personal information. Blizzard is required by law to retain certain personal information. To learn more about having your personal information erased or anonymised, please click on this [link](https://eu.battle.net/support/help/product/services/1327/1328).

You may object to the processing of your personal information if you believe Blizzard doesn’t have the appropriate rights to engage in that processing or if you wish to ask Blizzard not to process your personal information for direct marketing purposes. To learn more about making an objection, please click on this [link](https://eu.battle.net/support/help/product/services/1327/1330).

Rectification:

Restrict Processing:

You can request that your personal information no longer be processed in certain cases, for instance, when you exercise your right to object as described above. When objecting, you will be given an option to restrict processing.

Portability:

Data portability is the ability to move your personal information from one company to another (for instance, when you transfer your mobile phone service to another carrier). While this right is not very applicable to Blizzard’s current business, we will provide you with an electronic file of your most basic account information, should you request it. To obtain this file, please click this [link](https://eu.battle.net/support/help/product/services/1327/1342/solution).

8\. What is Real ID?
--------------------

By participating in Blizzard’s optional Real ID system, you will make your real name visible to your friend’s friends, who will also be able to invite you to become friends.

When you and a friend mutually agree to become Real ID friends, you will have access to a number of additional features, including the following:

9\. What are tracking technologies, and how are they used?
----------------------------------------------------------

Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners ([listed here](https://eu.blizzard.com/en-gb/company/about/marketing-partners.html)), may use tracking technologies like cookies, beacons, tags, scripts and unique codes used in apps. These technologies are used in analysing trends, administering the websites or apps, tracking users’ movements around the websites or apps and gathering demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual, as well as an aggregated, basis.

We use this technology for various purposes, including our shopping cart, maintenance of user settings (e.g. language preference) and authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use some of the features or areas of our websites may be limited.

We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. For this reason, these types of clear gifs are tied to personal information.

We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies and Local Storage such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5. To manage Flash cookies, please click [here](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html).

We partner with third party ad networks to either display advertising on our websites or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partners may use tracking technologies to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. Some of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organisations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads. If you wish not to have your information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the [DAA's Consumer Choice page](http://www.aboutads.info/choices) and/or the [NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices). Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads. Please also note that we strive to adhere to the [DAA's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising](https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/sites/aboutads/files/DAA_files/seven-principles-07-01-09.pdf).

10\. What are Internet Protocol addresses?
------------------------------------------

An Internet Protocol ("IP") address is the unique number assigned to your computer. Blizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused. See tracking technology discussion above.

11\. What level of security is applied to your personal information?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

To help protect the privacy of the information and personal information you provide to us and that we learn from you, we maintain physical, technical and administrative safeguards. We update and test our security technology on an ongoing basis. In addition, we will take reasonable steps to assure that third parties to whom we transfer any personal information will provide sufficient protection.. We restrict access to your personal information to those employees indicated above. In addition, we train our employees about the importance of confidentiality and maintaining the privacy and security of your information.

12\. Note to Parents
--------------------

We recognise a special obligation to protect personal information about children. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses or phone numbers without permission when they are on-line.

Once a child states that his/her age is under 16, he or she will be unable to register an account with us. We do not knowingly collect or store any personal information from children under the age of 16. If parents believe that we have unintentionally collected their children’s personal information, they may request the deletion of the information by contacting us at [EU-Privacy@Blizzard.com](mailto:eu-privacy@blizzard.com).

Blizzard has engineered Parental Controls to help parents monitor and limit, if necessary, the amount of time their children spend interacting with our games. For more information, you may visit our Parental Controls area at [BattleNet Support](https://eu.battle.net/support/article/32243).

13\. Further Information or Complaints
--------------------------------------

If you have questions or concerns regarding your personal information protection at Blizzard, you may contact our Data Protection Officer by writing to [DPO@Blizzard.com](mailto:dpo@blizzard.com).

Each EU Member State shall provide one or more independent public authority (ies) to be responsible for monitoring the application of the GDPR in order to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons in relation to processing and to facilitate the free flow of personal information within the Union (‘supervisory authority’). If you feel that Blizzard has violated your rights, or if you wish to raise a concern with the data protection authorities, please contact the supervisory authority in the country where you live, work, or where you believe a breach of data protection law has occurred.
