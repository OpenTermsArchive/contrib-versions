Our ad network partners may use tracking technologies to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. Some of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organisations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads. If you wish not to have your information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the [DAA's Consumer Choice page](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) and/or the [NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/). Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads. Please also note that we strive to adhere to the [DAA's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising](http://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/sites/aboutads/files/DAA_files/seven-principles-07-01-09.pdf).

10\. What are Internet Protocol addresses?
------------------------------------------

An Internet Protocol ("IP") address is the unique number assigned to your computer. Blizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, country detection, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused. See tracking technology discussion above.

11\. What level of security is applied to your personal information?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

To help protect the privacy of the information and personal information you provide to us and that we learn from you, we maintain physical, technical and administrative safeguards. We update and test our security technology on an ongoing basis. In addition, we will take reasonable steps to assure that third parties to whom we transfer any personal information will provide sufficient protection. We restrict access to your personal information to those employees indicated above. In addition, we train our employees about the importance of confidentiality and maintaining the privacy and security of your information.

12\. Note to Parents
--------------------

We recognise a special obligation to protect personal information about children. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses or phone numbers without permission when they are online.

Once a child states that his/her age is under 16 (or under 18 in the UK), he or she will be unable to register an account with us. Parents or guardians will be prompted to create a parental account and a child account for their child. If parents believe that we have unintentionally collected their children’s personal information, they may request the deletion of the information by contacting us at [EU-Privacy@Blizzard.com](https://www.blizzard.com/en-gb/legal/8c41e7e6-0b61-42c4-a674-c91d8e8d68d3/EU-Privacy@Blizzard.com).

Blizzard has engineered Parental Controls to help parents monitor and limit, if necessary, the amount of time their children spend interacting with our games. For more information, you may visit our Parental Controls area at [BattleNet Support](https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/32243).

13\. Further Information or Complaints
--------------------------------------

If you have questions or concerns regarding your personal information protection at Blizzard, you may contact our Data Protection Officer by writing to [DPO@Blizzard.com](mailto:DPO@blizzard.com).

Each EU Member State shall provide one or more independent public authority (ies) to be responsible for monitoring the application of the GDPR in order to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons in relation to processing and to facilitate the free flow of personal information within the Union (‘supervisory authority’), as well as the UK in application of the UK-GDPR (Data Protection Act 2018). If you feel that Blizzard has violated your rights, or if you wish to raise a concern with the data protection authorities, please contact the supervisory authority in the country where you live, work, or where you believe a breach of data protection law has occurred.
