In some very rare, specific and restricted cases, we may ask you to provide a copy partially obfuscated of a document or government-issued ID to verify your identity, location, and/or account ownership to comply with our legal obligations. When photo identification is provided to us, it is normally deleted as soon as the identification verification is complete or after 30 days if the case was not addressed within this period of time, unless otherwise required to establish, defend, or exercise our legal rights.

--------------------

Real ID friends can see each other’s real-life name and can see each other’s characters across all Blizzard products and services. By participating in Blizzard’s optional Real ID system, you will make your real name visible to your friend’s friends, who will also be able to invite you to become friends.

When you and a friend mutually agree to become Real ID friends, you will have access to a number of additional features, including the following:

*   Real Names for Friends: Your Real ID friends will appear under their real-life names on your friends list, when chatting, communicating in-game, or viewing a character's profile.
*   Cross-Realm and Cross-Game Chat: With Real ID, friends can chat cross-realm, cross-faction, and cross-game using Blizzard’s products and services.
*   Rich Presence: You will see additional info on your friends list about what your Real ID friends are up to in Blizzard’s products and services in real time.

9\. What are tracking technologies, and how are they used?
----------------------------------------------------------

Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners ([listed here](https://www.blizzard.com/en-gb/legal/7fac8c01-ac9c-4c51-82ec-1f535e1f54ba/marketing-partners)), may use tracking technologies like cookies, beacons, tags, scripts and unique codes used in apps. These technologies are used in analysing trends, administering the websites or apps, tracking users’ movements around the websites or apps and gathering demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual, as well as an aggregated, basis.

We use this technology for various purposes, including our shopping cart, maintenance of user settings (e.g. language preference) and authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use some of the features or areas of our websites may be limited. To manage your cookie settings, please click [here](https://www.blizzard.com/en-gb/cookies#settings).

We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. For this reason, these types of clear gifs are tied to personal information.

We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies and Local Storage such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5. To manage Flash cookies, please click [here](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html).

We partner with third party ad networks to either display advertising on our websites or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partners may use tracking technologies to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. Some of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organisations who offer a single location to opt- out of receiving tailored ads. If you wish not to have your information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the [DAA's Consumer Choice page](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) and/or the [NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/). Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads. Please also note that we strive to adhere to the [DAA's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising](http://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/sites/aboutads/files/DAA_files/seven-principles-07-01-09.pdf).

10\. What are Internet Protocol addresses?
------------------------------------------

An Internet Protocol ("IP") address is the unique number assigned to your computer. Blizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, country detection, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused. See tracking technology discussion above.

11\. What level of security is applied to your personal information?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

To help protect the privacy of the information and personal information you provide to us and that we learn from you, we maintain physical, technical and administrative safeguards. We update and test our security technology on an ongoing basis. In addition, we will take reasonable steps to assure that third parties to whom we transfer any personal information will provide sufficient protection. We restrict access to your personal information to those employees indicated above. In addition, we train our employees about the importance of confidentiality and maintaining the privacy and security of your information.

12\. Note to Parents
--------------------

We recognise a special obligation to protect personal information about children. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses or phone numbers without permission when they are on line.

Once a child states that his/her age is under 16 (or under 18 in the UK), he or she will be unable to register an account with us. Parents or guardians will be prompted to create a parental account and a child account for their child. If parents believe that we have unintentionally collected their children’s personal information, they may request the deletion of the information by contacting us at [EU-Privacy@Blizzard.com](mailto:EU-Privacy@Blizzard.com).

Blizzard has engineered Parental Controls to help parents monitor and limit, if necessary, the amount of time their children spend interacting with our games. For more information, you may visit our Parental Controls area at [BattleNet Support](https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/32243).

13\. Further Information or Complaints
--------------------------------------

If you have questions or concerns regarding your personal information protection at Blizzard, you may contact our Data Protection Officer by writing to [DPO@Blizzard.com](mailto:DPO@Blizzard.com).

Each EU Member State and other countries shall provide one or more independent public authority (ies) to be responsible for monitoring the application of the GDPR in order to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons in relation to processing and to facilitate the free flow of personal information within the Union (‘supervisory authority’), as well as the UK in application of the UK-GDPR (Data Protection Act 2018). If you feel that Blizzard has violated your rights, or if you wish to raise a concern with the data protection authorities, please contact the supervisory authority in the country where you live, work, or where you believe a breach of data protection law has occurred.
