Disclosure Of Personal Information
----------------------------------

  

We may disclose, and may have disclosed in the preceding 12 months, the following categories of your personal information for business or commercial purposes to the categories of recipients listed below. Please note that because this list is comprehensive it may refer to types of information that we disclose about individuals other than yourself.

In addition to the specific situations discussed elsewhere in this policy, we disclose personal information in the following situations:

*   **Corporate Transactions.** If another company acquires (or proposed to acquire) our company, business, or our assets, we will also disclose your personal information with that company, including at the negotiation stage.

*   **Other Parties.** We may disclose personal information in response to subpoenas, warrants, or court orders, or in connection with any legal process, or to comply with relevant laws.

Their use of your information is not governed by this privacy policy.

We may also disclose other information, including information collected by tracking technologies, which may be used by third parties for their own marketing, advertising, and other purposes (see the Cookies & Similar Technologies section for more information).
*   **De-identified Personal Information.** We may disclose or use aggregated or de-identified data for any lawful purpose. De-identified information is generally not considered to be personal information under applicable laws.

Your Rights & Choices
---------------------

  

Pursuant to applicable data protection law, you can make the following choices regarding your personal information:

*   **Promotional Emails.** You may choose to provide us with your email address for the purpose of allowing us to send free newsletters, surveys, offers, and other promotional materials to you, as well as targeted offers from third parties. You can stop receiving promotional emails by clicking the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any promotional e-mail that you receive from us, or by logging into your account on WorldMarket.com, clicking on the "Profile" page, and managing your email preferences. Although we will remove your name from our mailing list after receiving your request within the timeframe permitted by law, you may still receive mailings from us that had been initiated prior to your name being removed. If you decide not to receive promotional emails, we may still send you transactional communications, such as those about your account, to fulfill orders you have made, to ask you to rate the product you purchased, or other service-related communications.
*   **Promotional Text Messages.** You can opt-out of receiving text messages from us by replying "STOP" to the text message you receive from us or following other instructions provided to you when you elected to receive texts. Please note that this will only opt you out of the specific text messaging program associated with that number.
*   **Direct Mailing.** If at any time you do not want to receive offers and/or circulars from us you can remove yourself from our mailing lists by completing and submitting the form [here](https://worldmarket.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=25974881155739). Please note that our mailings are prepared in advance of their being sent. Although we will remove your name from our mailing list after receiving your request, you may still receive mailings from us that had been initiated prior to your name being removed.
*   **Changes To Your Personal Information.** We rely on you to update and correct your personal information. Our website allows you to modify your account profile. Note that we may keep historical information in our backup files as permitted by law.
*   **Deletion Of Your Personal Information.** You may request that we delete your personal information. If required by law, we will delete your personal information after such request is made. We may also decide to delete your data if we believe that the data is incomplete or inaccurate, or that our continued use and storage are contrary to our obligations to other individuals or third parties. When we delete personal information, it will be removed from our active database, but it may remain in archives where it is not practical or possible to delete it. You should note that there are some situations in which we may decline to delete your personal information. For example, we retain the information that we collect to, among other things, detect security incidents, comply with our legal obligations, enforce any of our agreement, and protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity. We will retain your World Market Rewards information for the duration of your membership in order to carry out our obligation to provide you with points for purchases made and allowing you to redeem your points for rewards.
*   **Access To Your Personal Information.** You have the right to request access to the personal information we hold about you, along with other information such as the purposes of the processing, the recipients, or categories of recipients to whom the personal information has been or will be disclosed, the sources of the personal information, retention, and transfers of personal information, and a list of third party recipients of personal information that we process. If required by law, upon request, we will grant you with reasonable access to the personal information that we have about you. Where required by law, we may also transfer a machine-readable copy of your personal information to you or a third party of your choice.
*   **Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising or the Sale of My Personal Information.** Subject to certain exceptions, you may have the right to opt out of the "sale" of your personal information. It may be considered a "sale" of personal information under applicable law when we disclose certain names and contact information to advertising networks and data enrichment providers. Also, we use services that help deliver interest-based ads to you and may transfer personal information to business partners for their use. Making personal information (such as online/device identifiers, browsing activity, or geolocation data) available to these third parties may be considered "targeted advertising" or a "share" under applicable law. To opt out of "targeted advertising" or the "sale" of your personal information as just described, please click the "Privacy Choices" link at the bottom of our Site and set your preferences. Please note that your use of our Site may still be tracked by World Market and/or our service providers.
*   **Online Tracking.** Some web browsers incorporate a "Do Not Track" (DNT) or similar feature that signals to websites that a visitor does not want to have his/her online activity and behavior tracked. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and there is currently no industry consensus for how to recognize or respond to a DNT signal. We will endeavor to recognize commercially recognized opt out signals (e.g., Global Privacy Control). Recognition of this signal will only take place with respect to the device and/or browser that communicates the signal.
*   **Restriction of Processing of Sensitive Personal Information.** You have the right to request the restriction of processing of your sensitive personal information. Where applicable, the respective sensitive personal information will be marked accordingly and may only be processed by us for certain purposes. At the current time, however, we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information for purposes other than those expressed in this Policy or otherwise permitted by applicable law, and these uses cannot be limited under California law.
*   **Automated Processing.** Under certain circumstances, you have the right to object to a significant decision based solely on automated processing (i.e., without human intervention) unless that decision is required or authorized by law. At the current time, however, we do not engage in automated processing without human intervention.
*   **Right of Non-Discrimination/Retaliation.** We do not discriminate against individuals who exercise any of their rights described in this Privacy Notice, nor do we retaliate against individuals who exercise these rights.

Please note that many of the above rights are subject to exceptions and limitations. Your rights and our responses will vary based on the circumstances of the request. If you choose to assert any of these rights under applicable law, we will respond within the time period prescribed by such law.

In certain jurisdictions, a person authorized to act on your behalf may make a verifiable request related to your personal information. If you designate an authorized person to submit requests to exercise certain privacy rights on your behalf, we will require verification that you provided the authorized agent permission to make a request on your behalf. In any circumstance, your request must: (i) provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative of that person; and (ii) describe the request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.

To exercise your rights, please call us at [1-877-967-5362](tel:1-877-967-5362), or submit an online [Request](https://worldmarket.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360002045994). In certain jurisdictions, you may appeal our decision to your request regarding your personal information. To do so, please contact us in any of the ways listed in the "Contact Information" section. We respond to all appeal requests as soon as we reasonably can, and no later than legally required. If you are a current California World Market employee, please refer to our California Employee Privacy Notice. Former employees may obtain a copy of the Notice by making a request using the contact information below.

How We Protect Personal Information
-----------------------------------

  

No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is fully secure. While we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information. In the event that we are required by law to inform you of any unauthorized access to your personal information we may notify you electronically, in writing, or by telephone, if permitted to do so by law.

Some of our Sites permit you to create an account. When you do you will be prompted to create a password. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password, and you are responsible for any access to or use of your account by someone else who has obtained your password, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by you. You should notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or account.

How Long We Retain Information
------------------------------

  

We retain information about you and your relationship with us for as long as is needed to fulfill our legitimate business purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice. The specific periods for which we keep information about you vary depending on the nature of the information, why we need it, and whether the personal information is de-identified. We also consider the minimum necessary retention period prescribed by applicable laws, recommended by industry standards, and stated in contracts and other legal obligations.

Bona Fide Loyalty Program Disclosure/Notice Of Financial Incentive
------------------------------------------------------------------

  

In connection with World Market Rewards we offer our customers certain perks, such as rewards, promotions, and exclusive offers.

*   When you sign up for the World Market Rewards Program, we will ask you to provide your name, mobile number, and zip code.
*   The categories of third parties that may receive this information for targeted advertising include online advertising networks, our financial service partner Comenity Bank, and data enrichment providers.
*   We currently do not collect any sensitive personal information in connection with World Market Rewards.
*   We partner with Comenity Bank to offer the World Market credit card to World Market Rewards members. As a World Market Rewards member, you can apply for the World Market credit card online or in our stores.
*   If you request that we delete any of your personal information that is essential to providing you with the World Market Rewards program, we will not be able to provide you with the benefits of that program (e.g., if your phone number is also your World Market Rewards 10-digit identifier and you ask us to delete your phone number, we will no longer be able to maintain your World Market Rewards account).

Because World Market Rewards involves the collection of personal information, it might be interpreted as a "financial incentive" program under California law. The value of your personal information to us is related to the value of the free or discounted products or services that you obtain when you redeem points. This value is based on the expense related to offering those free or discounted products or services.

You may withdraw from participating in World Market Rewards at any time by contacting customer service at [customercare@worldmarket.com](mailto:customercare@worldmarket.com) with "REMOVE REWARDS PROGRAM" in the subject line along with your name, address and zip code. Visit the Terms and Conditions page to view full program rules, including how to join.

Pursuant to applicable data protection law, you can make the following choices regarding your personal information:

*   **Promotional Emails.** You may choose to provide us with your email address for the purpose of allowing us to send free newsletters, surveys, offers, and other promotional materials to you, as well as targeted offers from third parties. You can stop receiving promotional emails by clicking the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any promotional e-mail that you receive from us, or by logging into your account on WorldMarket.com, clicking on the "Profile" page, and managing your email preferences. Although we will remove your name from our mailing list after receiving your request within the timeframe permitted by law, you may still receive mailings from us that had been initiated prior to your name being removed. If you decide not to receive promotional emails, we may still send you transactional communications, such as those about your account, to fulfill orders you have made, to ask you to rate the product you purchased, or other service-related communications.
*   **Promotional Text Messages.** You can opt-out of receiving text messages from us by replying "STOP" to the text message you receive from us or following other instructions provided to you when you elected to receive texts. Please note that this will only opt you out of the specific text messaging program associated with that number.
*   **Direct Mailing.** If at any time you do not want to receive offers and/or circulars from us you can remove yourself from our mailing lists by completing and submitting the form [here](https://worldmarket.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=25974881155739). Please note that our mailings are prepared in advance of their being sent. Although we will remove your name from our mailing list after receiving your request, you may still receive mailings from us that had been initiated prior to your name being removed.
*   **Changes To Your Personal Information.** We rely on you to update and correct your personal information. Our website allows you to modify your account profile. Note that we may keep historical information in our backup files as permitted by law.
*   **Deletion Of Your Personal Information.** You may request that we delete your personal information. If required by law, we will delete your personal information after such request is made. We may also decide to delete your data if we believe that the data is incomplete or inaccurate, or that our continued use and storage are contrary to our obligations to other individuals or third parties. When we delete personal information, it will be removed from our active database, but it may remain in archives where it is not practical or possible to delete it. You should note that there are some situations in which we may decline to delete your personal information. For example, we retain the information that we collect to, among other things, detect security incidents, comply with our legal obligations, enforce any of our agreement, and protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity. We will retain your World Market Rewards information for the duration of your membership in order to carry out our obligation to provide you with points for purchases made and allowing you to redeem your points for rewards.
*   **Access To Your Personal Information.** You have the right to request access to the personal information we hold about you, along with other information such as the purposes of the processing, the recipients, or categories of recipients to whom the personal information has been or will be disclosed, the sources of the personal information, retention, and transfers of personal information, and a list of third party recipients of personal information that we process.

*   **Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising or the Sale of My Personal Information.** Subject to certain exceptions, you may have the right to opt out of the "sale" of your personal information. It may be considered a "sale" of personal information under applicable law when we disclose certain names and contact information to advertising networks and data enrichment providers. Also, we use services that help deliver interest-based ads to you and may transfer personal information to business partners for their use. Making personal information (such as online/device identifiers, browsing activity, or geolocation data) available to these third parties may be considered "targeted advertising" or a "share" under applicable law. To opt out of "targeted advertising" or the "sale" of your personal information as just described, please click the "Privacy Choices" link at the bottom of our Site and set your preferences. Please note that your use of our Site may still be tracked by World Market and/or our service providers.
*   **Online Tracking.** Some web browsers incorporate a "Do Not Track" (DNT) or similar feature that signals to websites that a visitor does not want to have his/her online activity and behavior tracked. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and there is currently no industry consensus for how to recognize or respond to a DNT signal. We will endeavor to recognize commercially recognized opt out signals (e.g., Global Privacy Control). Recognition of this signal will only take place with respect to the device and/or browser that communicates the signal.
*   **Restriction of Processing of Sensitive Personal Information.** You have the right to request the restriction of processing of your sensitive personal information. Where applicable, the respective sensitive personal information will be marked accordingly and may only be processed by us for certain purposes. At the current time, however, we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information for purposes other than those expressed in this Policy or otherwise permitted by applicable law, and these uses cannot be limited under California law.
*   **Automated Processing.** Under certain circumstances, you have the right to object to a significant decision based solely on automated processing (i.e., without human intervention) unless that decision is required or authorized by law. At the current time, however, we do not engage in automated processing without human intervention.
*   **Right of Non-Discrimination/Retaliation.** We do not discriminate against individuals who exercise any of their rights described in this Privacy Notice, nor do we retaliate against individuals who exercise these rights.

Please note that many of the above rights are subject to exceptions and limitations. Your rights and our responses will vary based on the circumstances of the request. If you choose to assert any of these rights under applicable law, we will respond within the time period prescribed by such law.

In certain jurisdictions, a person authorized to act on your behalf may make a verifiable request related to your personal information. If you designate an authorized person to submit requests to exercise certain privacy rights on your behalf, we will require verification that you provided the authorized agent permission to make a request on your behalf. In any circumstance, your request must: (i) provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative of that person; and (ii) describe the request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.

To exercise your rights, please call us at [1-877-967-5362](tel:1-877-967-5362), or submit an online [Request](https://worldmarket.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360002045994). In certain jurisdictions, you may appeal our decision to your request regarding your personal information. To do so, please contact us in any of the ways listed in the "Contact Information" section. We respond to all appeal requests as soon as we reasonably can, and no later than legally required. If you are a current California World Market employee, please refer to our California Employee Privacy Notice. Former employees may obtain a copy of the Notice by making a request using the contact information below.

How We Protect Personal Information
-----------------------------------

  

No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is fully secure. While we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information. In the event that we are required by law to inform you of any unauthorized access to your personal information we may notify you electronically, in writing, or by telephone, if permitted to do so by law.

Some of our Sites permit you to create an account. When you do you will be prompted to create a password. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password, and you are responsible for any access to or use of your account by someone else who has obtained your password, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by you. You should notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or account.

How Long We Retain Information
------------------------------

  

We retain information about you and your relationship with us for as long as is needed to fulfill our legitimate business purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice. The specific periods for which we keep information about you vary depending on the nature of the information, why we need it, and whether the personal information is de-identified. We also consider the minimum necessary retention period prescribed by applicable laws, recommended by industry standards, and stated in contracts and other legal obligations.

Bona Fide Loyalty Program Disclosure/Notice Of Financial Incentive
------------------------------------------------------------------

  

In connection with World Market Rewards we offer our customers certain perks, such as rewards, promotions, and exclusive offers.

*   When you sign up for the World Market Rewards Program, we will ask you to provide your name, mobile number, and zip code.
*   The categories of third parties that may receive this information for targeted advertising include online advertising networks, our financial service partner Comenity Bank, and data enrichment providers.
*   We currently do not collect any sensitive personal information in connection with World Market Rewards.
*   We partner with Comenity Bank to offer the World Market credit card to World Market Rewards members. As a World Market Rewards member, you can apply for the World Market credit card online or in our stores.
*   If you request that we delete any of your personal information that is essential to providing you with the World Market Rewards program, we will not be able to provide you with the benefits of that program (e.g., if your phone number is also your World Market Rewards 10-digit identifier and you ask us to delete your phone number, we will no longer be able to maintain your World Market Rewards account).

Because World Market Rewards involves the collection of personal information, it might be interpreted as a "financial incentive" program under California law. The value of your personal information to us is related to the value of the free or discounted products or services that you obtain when you redeem points. This value is based on the expense related to offering those free or discounted products or services.

You may withdraw from participating in World Market Rewards at any time by contacting customer service at [customercare@worldmarket.com](mailto:customercare@worldmarket.com) with "REMOVE REWARDS PROGRAM" in the subject line along with your name, address and zip code. Visit the Terms and Conditions page to view full program rules, including how to join.
