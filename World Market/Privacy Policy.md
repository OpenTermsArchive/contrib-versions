3. **Changes To Your Personal Information.** We rely on you to update and correct your personal information. Our website allows you to modify your account profile. Note that we may keep historical information in our backup files as permitted by law.
4. **Deletion Of Your Personal Information.** In certain circumstances, you may request that we delete your personal information. If required by law, we will delete your personal information after such a request is made. We may also decide to delete your data if we believe that the data is incomplete, inaccurate, or that our continued use and storage are contrary to our obligations to other individuals or third parties. When we delete personal information, it will be removed from our active database, but it may remain in archives where it is not practical or possible to delete it. You should note that there are some situations in which we may decline to delete your personal information. For example, we retain the information that we collect to, among other things, detect security incidents, comply with our legal obligations, enforce any of our agreement, and protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity.

If you revoke your consent for the processing of personal information, then we may no longer be able to provide you services.

6. **Access To Your Personal Information.** You have the right to request access to the personal information we hold about you, along with other information such as the purposes of the processing, the recipients, or categories of recipients to whom the personal information has been or will be disclosed, the sources of the personal information, retention, and transfers of personal information. If required by law, upon request, we will grant you with reasonable access to the personal information that we have about you. Where required by law, we may also transfer a machine-readable copy of your personal information to you or a third party of your choice. Note that California residents may be entitled to ask us for a notice describing what categories of personal information (if any) we disclose to third parties or affiliates for direct marketing.
7. **Do Not Sell My Personal Information.** Subject to certain exceptions, California residents have the right to opt out of the "sale" of their personal information. It may be considered a "sale" or "sharing" of personal information under California law when we disclose certain names, contact information, and purchasing history with third party businesses whose catalogues may be of interest to you. Also, we use services that help deliver interest-based ads to you and may transfer personal information to business partners for their use. Making personal information (such as online/device identifiers, browsing activity, or geolocation data) available to these third parties may be considered a "share" under California law. To opt out of the "sale"/"sharing" of your personal information as just described, please click the "Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information" link at the bottom of our website and set your preferences, or click [here](https://worldmarket.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=1260811375130). Please note that your use of our website may still be tracked by World Market and/or our service providers.
8. **Online Tracking.** Some web browsers incorporate a "Do Not Track" (DNT) or similar feature that signals to websites that a visitor does not want to have his/her online activity and behavior tracked. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and there is currently no industry consensus for how to recognize or respond to a DNT signal. We will endeavor to recognize commercially recognized opt out signals (e.g., Global Privacy Control). Recognition of this signal will only take place with respect to the device and/or browser that communicates the signal.
9. **Restriction of processing of Sensitive Personal Information.** You have the right to request the restriction of processing of your sensitive personal information. Where applicable, the respective sensitive personal information will be marked accordingly and may only be processed by us for certain purposes. At the current time, however, we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information for purposes other than those expressed in this Policy or otherwise permitted by applicable law, and these uses cannot be limited under California law.
10. **Automated Processing.** Under certain circumstances, you have the right to object to a significant decision based solely on automated processing (i.e., without human intervention) unless that decision is required or authorized by law. At the current time, however, we do not engage in automated processing without human intervention.
11. **Right of Non-Discrimination/Retaliation.** We do not discriminate against individuals who exercise any of their rights described in this Privacy Notice, nor do we retaliate against individuals who exercise these rights.

Please note that many of the above rights are subject to exceptions and limitations. Your rights and our responses will vary based on the circumstances of the request. If you choose to assert any of these rights under applicable law, we will respond within the time period prescribed by such law.

In the State of California, a person authorized to act on your behalf may make a verifiable request related to your Personal Information. If you designate an authorized person to submit requests to exercise certain privacy rights on your behalf, we will require verification that you provided the authorized agent permission to make a request on your behalf. In any circumstance, your request must: (i) provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or an authorized representative of that person; and (ii) describe the request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.

To exercise your rights, please call us at 877-967-5362, or submit an online [Request Form.](https://worldmarket.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360002045994) In certain jurisdictions, you may appeal our decision to your request regarding your personal information. To do so, pleasure contact us in any of the ways listed in the "Contact Information" section. We respond to all appeal requests as soon as we reasonably can, and no later than legally required.

### How We Protect Personal Information

No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is fully secure. While we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information. In the event that we are required by law to inform you of any unauthorized access to your personal information we may notify you electronically, in writing, or by telephone, if permitted to do so by law.

Some of our Sites permit you to create an account. When you do you will be prompted to create a password. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password, and you are responsible for any access to or use of your account by someone else who has obtained your password, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by you. You should notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or account.

### How Long We Retain Information

We retain information about you and your relationship with us for as long as is needed to fulfill our legitimate business purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice. The specific periods for which we keep information about you vary depending on the nature of the information, why we need it, and whether the personal information is de-identified. We also consider the minimum necessary retention period prescribed by applicable laws, recommended by industry standards, and stated in contracts and other legal obligations.

### Notice of Financial Incentive

We offer our customers a Rewards Program that provides certain perks, such as rewards, promotions, and exclusive offers (the "World Market Rewards Program"). When you sign up for the World Market Rewards Program, we will ask you to provide your name and email address. Because our World Rewards Program involves the collection of personal information, it might be interpreted as a "financial incentive" program under California law. The value of your personal information to us is related to the value of the free or discounted products or services that you obtain when you redeem points. This value is based on the expense related to offering those free or discounted products or services.

You may withdraw from participating in the Rewards Program at any time by contacting customer service at [customercare@worldmarket.com](mailto:customercare@worldmarket.com) with "REMOVE REWARDS PROGRAM" in the subject line along with your name, address and zip code. [Visit the Terms and Conditions](https://www.worldmarket.com/category/customer-service/terms-of-use.do) page to view full program rules, including how to join.

### Information for Nevada Residents

Subject to certain exceptions, Nevada residents may opt-out of the "sale" of personal information. This may apply when we share certain names and mailing addresses of direct mail recipients with parties whose catalogues may be of interest to you. You may opt-out by clicking "Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information" link at the bottom of our website and setting your preferences, or by contacting us at [1-877-967-5362](tel:/(877)%20967-5362).

### Other Important Information

The following additional information relates to our privacy practices:

* **Third Party Applications/Websites.** We have no control over the privacy practices of websites or applications that we do not own. For example, to enhance your experience on this Site, we use Google Maps APIs including at account creation, and at checkout. Google has specifically requested that we inform you that your use of such services is subject to the Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service (including the Google Privacy Policy).
* **Changes To This Privacy Policy.** We may revise this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of changes by posting the effective date of the latest version at the top of this privacy policy.
* **Children's Privacy.** We will not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 and our websites and our services are not directed to children under the age of 13. If a child under 13 submits personal information to us and we learn that the information is from a child under 13, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible. In addition, we do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under the age of 16.
