**6\. Terms of Sale**

The following terms apply to your purchase of the products offered on this website ("Products")

(a) Purchasing Products. This website invites you to make us an offer to buy the Products shown on the pages. Your order is an offer to buy some of those goods, which we accept only by shipping the Products ordered. Any confirmation that you receive after placing an order does not constitute an acceptance of your offer, and is subject to correction before shipment in the event of inaccuracies, errors, Product unavailability, or for any other reason.

(b) Product Descriptions. We attempt to describe Products, including their colors, as accurately as possible; however, the appearance of Products may vary as a result of the quality of your monitor and for other reasons. We also make no guarantees with respect to the accuracy, completeness, reliability, or currency of our Product descriptions.

(c) No Commercial Use. Products are sold for the personal and household use of our customers. Products are not designed or otherwise intended for use in commercial or other public establishments, such as restaurants, coffee shops, retail stores of any kind, or commercial services such as caterers. Accordingly and without limiting any other provision of these Terms and Conditions, we will not be liable in connection with any such use. We also reserve the right to prohibit sale of Products to users who we believe are using Products for commercial purposes or reselling them.

(d) Children’s Products. Our Products that are not toys are generally not for use by children. Products that are toys are age graded to help you decide what is appropriate for your family.

When a Product is out of stock and cannot be replenished we will attempt to remove the Product from this website in a timely manner. Some Products offered for sale on this website may not be offered for sale at World Market® stores (and vice versa). While Products offered for sale at stores and on the website are generally offered at the same price, there may be price differences from time to time due to promotional events and special offers, or for other reasons.

Products offered for sale on this website are for sale only in the United States and all prices are quoted in U.S. dollars. We may occasionally make errors in the stated prices on this website. If a Product’s correct price is higher than the listed price, we will, in our discretion, either confirm the correct price with you or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation.

(g) Orders. We have the right to refuse or limit any orders and limit quantities. We will not be liable if a Product is unavailable or a shipment is delayed. We reserve the right to provide substantially similar products to fulfill your order.

(j) Transfer of Title and Risk of Loss/Damage. Title to and the risk of loss/damage of all Products passes from us to you at the time we deliver the Products to the common carrier for shipment.

We reserve the right to choose any and all procedures, packaging and the common carrier of sold Products. We may not be able to have your order shipped to a post office box, to certain addresses or on certain days. We reserve the right to ship your order in multiple boxes or shipments.

You and the Company agree that any dispute that has arisen or may arise between us relating in any way to your use of or access to the website, the Products, any breach, enforcement, or termination of these Terms and Conditions, or otherwise relating to the Company in any way (collectively, "Covered Matters") will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth herein:

(a) Arbitration. These Terms and Conditions and each of its parts evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce, and the Federal Arbitration Act applies in all cases and governs the interpretation and enforcement of the arbitration rules and arbitration proceedings. Any Covered Matter must be asserted individually in binding arbitration administered by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. ("JAMS") in accordance with JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (including, without limitation, utilizing desk, phone or video conference proceedings where appropriate and permitted to mitigate costs of travel) and the JAMS Policy on Consumer Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness (which will prevail over any inconsistent terms in this Section 17). The arbitrator shall not conduct any form of class or collective arbitration nor join or consolidate claims by or for individuals. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms and Conditions, including, any claim that all or any part of these Terms and Conditions is void or voidable or a particular claim is subject to arbitration. This Section 17 shall not, however, preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

(b) Applicable Law. United States federal law, and (to the extent not inconsistent with or pre-empted by federal law) the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict of laws principles, will govern all Covered Matters.

(c) Award. For matters where the relief sought is over $5,000, the arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitation of Liability" section as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER USERS.

(d) Exceptions. There are two exceptions to this agreement to arbitrate:

(i) First, if either party reasonably believes that the other party has in any manner violated or threatened to infringe the intellectual property rights of the other party, the party whose rights have been violated may seek injunctive or other appropriate interim relief in any court of competent jurisdiction.

(ii) Second, no party shall be precluded from seeking remedies in small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of its jurisdiction (including amounts) and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.

(e) Future Amendments to the Agreement to Arbitrate. Notwithstanding any provision in the Terms and Conditions to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any amendment to this agreement to arbitrate in the future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against the Company prior to the effective date of the amendment. The amendment shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed by the agreement to arbitrate that have arisen or may arise between you and the Company. If you do not agree to these amended terms, you may close your account and otherwise cease use of this website within thirty (30) days of the posting or notification and you will not be bound by the amended terms.

(f) Judicial Forum for Legal Disputes. Unless you and we agree otherwise, in the event that the agreement to arbitrate above is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute, either as a result of your decision to opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order or because you have chosen to file an eligible lawsuit in small claims court, you agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and the Company must be resolved exclusively by a state, federal, or small claims court located in Alameda County, California. You and the Company agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Alameda County, California for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.

(g) Opt-Out. IF YOU ARE USING THIS WEBSITE FOR THE FIRST TIME, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO REJECT THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE PROVISION ("OPT-OUT") BY PROVIDING THE OPT-OUT NOTICE DESCRIBED BELOW. THAT NOTICE MUST BE RECEIVED NO LATER THAN THIRTY (30) DAYS AFTER THE DATE YOU USE THE WEBSITE FOR THE FIRST TIME. IF YOU ARE NOT USING THE WEBSITE FOR THE FIRST TIME, YOU HAVE UNTIL THIRTY (30) DAYS AFTER THE POSTING OF THE VERSION OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FIRST CONTAINING AN OPT-OUT TO SUBMIT AN ARBITRATION OPT-OUT NOTICE.

(h) Procedure. In order to opt-out, you must email your name, address (including street address, city, state, and zip code), and email address(es) associated with your account(s) to which the opt-out applies and an unaltered digital image of a valid driver’s license which matches the name on your account to: [customercare@worldmarket.com](mailto:customercare@worldmarket.com). This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the agreement to arbitrate. If you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, all other parts of these Terms and Conditions and this Disputes section will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this agreement to arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us.

(i) WAIVER. BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO A COURT TRIAL (OTHER THAN SMALL CLAIMS COURT AS PROVIDED ABOVE) OR TO SERVE AS A REPRESENTATIVE, AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR IN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS, IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING FILED AGAINST US AND/OR RELATED THIRD PARTIES.
