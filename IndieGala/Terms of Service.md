Once you make a purchase, you should receive a unique game download page. You shall not, directly or indirectly, disclose the unique URL for your download page to anyone else or use anyone else's download page. You are solely and entirely responsible for all activities that occur on your download page. INDIEGALA shall not be responsible for any losses arising out of the unauthorized use of your download page.  
  
Objectionable Material. You understand that by using the Service and Products, you may encounter content that may be deemed mature, offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as having explicit language or adult themes, and which may be due to the content of the Product or your interactions with other users in the course of using the Products. You agree to use the Service at your sole risk and that INDIEGALA shall have no liability to you for content that may be found to be mature, offensive, indecent, or objectionable.  
  
Product Requirements. Use of the Service and/or Products requires a compatible computer, Internet access (fees may apply), and certain software (fees may apply), and may require obtaining patches, updates or upgrades from time to time. Because use of the Service and/or Products involves hardware, software, and Internet access (high speed Internet access is strongly recommended), your ability to use the Service and/or Products may be affected by these factors.

Orders. Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell.

Delivery of Products. On occasion, technical problems may delay, interrupt or prevent the download or activation of your Product.
