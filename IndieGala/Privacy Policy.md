### What "Personal data" and "Processing your personal data" means to us?

By "Personal data" we mean information about any individual or from which any individual is directly or indirectly identifiable. This inlcudes your personal details (e.g., name); demographic data (e.g., age); contact details (e.g., address); records of your consents; purchase details; information about your interactions with our content or advertising; and any views or opinions you provide to us. We may also Process information about you from your use of our Services (e.g., the type of device you are using, the internet service provider, etc.), including your interactions with content and advertising on the Services.  
  
By "Process", "Processing" or "Processed" in the context of your personal data we mean anything that is done with any Personal Information, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.

### Which personal data we collect and how we collect it?

There are three types of personal data we or our partners may collect from you:

* Personal information which is provided voluntarily by you to us:
    * personal data you provide when registering an account on our web platform;
    * personal data you provide when you subscribe to our email newsletter and/or push notifications;
    * personal data you provide when you participate in a giveaway offer we organize;
    * any other personal data you chose to send to us via email or postal service.
* Personal information we collect automatically:
    * information about your computer and your position. This may include IP address, geo-location, operating system, number of visits and/or page views, referral page and browsing history on our website;
    * information about the purchases made on this website or, in some cases, made on third parties (e.g. if you connect your Steam account to your IndieGala account and your Steam privacy settings are set to public, we may see the list of games you own on Steam or on which groups you are part of);
    * information about the giveaways you've participated in on our site or on third party partners.
* Online Behavioral Advertising ("OBA") data collected by us or third parties we work with

  
We may use analytics software (e.g. Google Analytics) to collect data and to better understand your behaviour on our site and your commercial preferences. This software may record information such as how often you use our website, the events that occur within the website, which product pages you visit or which products you buy, aggregated usage, performance data, and where you reached our site from.  
  
Certain third parties (Google AdSense or Facebook) may collect information about you for online behavioral advertising ("OBA") purposes in order for you to receive relevant interest-based advertising on the Services and on other websites, platforms and media channels. OBA is also referred to as interest-based advertising.  
  
These third parties may use Online Data as well as other User Information to send you OBA. For example, if you read an article about a particular subject on the Services, the third party may use cookies to later serve you an advertisement for a particular product or service related to the viewed article. These third party vendors may connect information about pages you visit on the Services with information about pages you visit on other Channels and show you advertising based on this combined information. These advertisements may appear when you are visiting a different section of the Services or on another Channel.  
  
The specific providers we use for OBA are subject to constant change. Below you can find a list of some of the providers we use most often:

We may disclose your User Information to other entities for legitimate business purposes (including operating the Services, and providing services to you), in accordance with applicable law. In addition, we may disclose your User Information to:

If you choose to interact with any such advertising, plugins or content, information about your activities on the Channels to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests may be shared with the relevant third party provider. If you click or tap on or otherwise interact with an advertisement, the advertiser may assume that you meet its target criteria;

* any sponsors of promotional giveaways, the registration data for such events is to be used by us as part of User Information, and may be shared with the sponsor and others, subject to this Policy and the sponsor’s privacy policy. We may also share your information with third party vendors involved in the administration of such events.

* to third parties whose practices are not covered by this Privacy Policy (e.g., third party providers of goods and services, marketing and advertising companies and agencies, analytics providers and retailers).

  
Certain functionalities on the Service permit interactions that you initiate between the Service and certain third party services ("Third Party Features"). Examples of Third Party Features include "liking" or "sharing" content over social media platforms through our Service or linking your IndieGala account to a third party service such as Steam. If you use Third Party Features, both IndieGala and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of our Service and the third party service. For example, if you link your IndieGala account to Steam, we may receive information related to your Steam account for the duration of the linking, including information about the games you own on the Service. Similarly, if you post information on a third party service that references our Service (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with IndieGala in a tweet or status update), your post may be used on or in connection with our Service or that third party service. We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from the Service, nor the information or content contained therein or any information third parties obtain through your use of Third Party Features. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Service to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our website, is subject to that website's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.  
  
With respect to surveys, in the event that responses are publicly disclosed, users will be notified at the time they take the survey. Otherwise we will disclose only aggregate information regarding its users’ responses in surveys to other participants in the survey. Where surveys allow users to submit written comments, and where IndieGala advises users of the possibility of such disclosure at the time they take the survey, IndieGala reserves the right to disclose any information provided by users, provided that no User Information identifying a specific user is disclosed.  
  
Some of our advertisers may use third party advertising service companies to serve advertisements, for OBA or otherwise, and perform related services when you interact with the Channels. Often, these third party advertising companies employ cookies and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of website and email advertisements and to create a record of interaction with our content that they use in conjunction with their advertising which appears on other sites or applications, or for reporting website traffic, app use, statistics, advertisement data and/or other activities on the Services. We also engage third party providers to assist with the segmentation of this data.  
  
We may engage third party providers to assist with the collection, storage and segmentation of Online Data and the providers are required to maintain the confidentiality of this information. These third party providers may collect User Information from our Services for their own purposes, such as to monitor fraud around the web.  
  
If we engage a third-party Processor to Process your User Information, the Processor will be subject to binding contractual obligations to: (i) only Process the User Information in accordance with our prior written instructions; and (ii) use measures to protect the confidentiality and security of the User Information; together with any additional requirements under applicable law.

### How do we secure your personal data?

We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your User Information. Please ensure that any Personal Information that you send to us is sent securely.  
  
The data we collect from the subjects indicated in this privacy policy, according to the indications of the relevant legislation, with particular regard to the security measures provided by the GDPR (Article 32) for their processing by means of computerized tools, manual and automated tools and with strictly related logic to the purposes indicated in above and in any case so as to guarantee the security and confidentiality of the data.  
  
In compliance with applicable regulations, a system of anti-spam verification on the communication between users is active.

However, we cannot guarantee there will not be a breach, and we are not responsible for any breach of security or for the actions of any third parties.  
  
Because the internet is an open system, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.
