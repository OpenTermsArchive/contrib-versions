INTRODUCTION

Fox News Network, L.L.C. ("FOX News" or "we") operates foxnews.com, foxbusiness.com, foxnews.mobi, m.foxbusiness.com, the FOX News iPhone application, the FOX Business iPhone application, the FOX News Android application, the FOX Business Android application, and any other FOX News owned and controlled URL, WAP site and mobile application (collectively, the "Site"), FOX News messaging services, video services, RSS feeds, podcasting services, mobile services, and any other feature, content, or applications offered from time to time by FOX News in connection with FOX News' business (collectively, the "FOX News Services"). FOX News is part of the United States based operations of News Corporation.

As set forth in our Terms of Use, FOX News is a general audience site, is not targeted to children, and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.

This Privacy Policy describes FOX News's collection and use of users' personal information (e.g., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address). It also describes generally FOX News's practices for handling non-personally identifiable information (e.g., user interests, demographics and site usage) to the extent such information is associated with a particular user or user account. This Privacy Policy applies to all "users," including both visitors (users who use some of the FOX News Services without being registered) and "Members" (users who have registered with FOX News).

SUBMISSION AND COLLECTION OF INFORMATION ON FOX NEWS SERVICES

User Submitted Information

**Registration Information** is the information that Members must provide to use at registration in order to create a profile (also called an "account"), and includes display name, email address, year of birth, zip code, and country.

FOX News Collected Information

**FOX News Services Activity Information.** When users access the FOX News Services, we may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection to the FOX News Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the FOX News Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device or other transactional information for that device in order to serve content to it. We also may use cookies and other tracking technologies (including browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies), which are comprised of small bits of data that often include an anonymous unique identifier. Web sites send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so the web site can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that site. We may use these technologies to anonymously collect and store information about your usage of the FOX News Services, such as pages you have visited, search queries you have run, and advertisements you have seen. If FOX News wishes to combine your personal information with information we obtain through these technologies in order to determine what messages FOX News provides to you, we will obtain your express affirmative consent.

Third parties that support the FOX News Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing users to share content or tracking aggregate site usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information. FOX News does not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies. For more information about third-party ad networks that use these technologies, see www.aboutads.info.

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g., http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies). Users can manage the use of Flash technologies, including cookies, with the Flash management tools available at Adobe's web site, see http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security/privacy\_policy/. Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features or personalization available through the FOX News Services.

**Public Information and Posts** consist of comments or content that you post to the Site and the information about you that accompanies those posts or content, which may include a name, user name, comments, likes, status, profile information and picture. Public information and posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines.

**Third Parties.** To improve the quality of the FOX News Services, we may supplement the information we collect with information from third parties. If you access the FOX News Services through a third-party connection, log-in, website, app or service, we may also collect your public user ID associated with that third-party service, and any information or content you have permitted that third party service to share with us, such as your profile picture, email address, and any information you have made public in connection with that service and which the third party shares with partner services. When you access the FOX News Services through a third party service, or when you connect the FOX News Services to a third party service, you are authorizing us to collect, store and use any and all information or content you have made public in connection with that service in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

FOX News is not responsible for the privacy practices of any such third parties, and once you leave the FOX News Services via a link, enable a third-party service, or click an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third-party site. Additionally, although all Affiliated Companies adhere to the News Corporation corporate Privacy Principles, users who visit an Affiliated Company site should still refer to its separate privacy policy, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy.
