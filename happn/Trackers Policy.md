HAPPN is very concerned about respecting your privacy and invites you to read this Use of Cookies document (hereinafter “the Policy”) to understand how HAPPN uses cookies and other trackers on its website and its applications. 

This Policy aims to complement the [Privacy Policy](https://www.happn.com/privacy/) and the [Terms of Service](https://www.happn.com/terms/) on the HAPPN website.

Terms starting with a capital letter and not defined in this document have the meanings of the terms defined in the [Terms of Service](https://www.happn.com/terms/).

1\. Scope of the Policy
-----------------------

The current Policy applies to the following media: 

*   The HAPPN website, available at the following address: [https://www.happn.com](https://www.happn.com/) (hereinafter, “the Website”);
*   The HAPPN mobile application, available on the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store (hereinafter, “the Application”);
*   The HAPPN web app (hereinafter, “the Web App”), available at the following address: [https://app.happn.com/signin](https://app.happn.com/signin)

2\. What are cookies and trackers?
----------------------------------

### 2.1. Cookies

A cookie is a small text file stored by the browser on the hard drive of a user’s terminal (PC, Smartphone, etc.) when he/she visits a website. Cookies are designed to contain a small amount of data attached to the user’s terminal, and can only be read by the website server that deposited them. 

A cookie can be categorized based on its lifetime and domain to which it belongs.

The lifetime of a cookie is either:

*   A session cookie, which is deleted when the user closes his/her browser
*   A persistent cookie that remains stored on the hard drive of the user’s terminal for a predetermined time.

Domain refers to either:

*   Proprietary cookies which are placed by the server of the website visited that shares the same domain
*   Thirdparty cookies are placed by a domain that is different from the website visited. For example, these cookies can be placed when a website makes reference to a file, such as JavaScript, located outside its domain (available on another site).

### 2.2. Other trackers

HAPPN uses tracking pixels from third-party sites on its Website and its Web App to compile statistics and audience measurements.

A tracking pixel is a code that is loaded when you visit a website, and can take the form of various resources (images, JavaScript, etc.) that are invisible to the naked eye. The tracking pixel collects information about your browsing and transfers it to the server on the website that installed the pixel. 

What’s more, internal and partner tools (hereinafter, “Tracking Tools) are also installed on the Application and the Web App to access and collect details on your device (hereinafter, “User Details”). The following data can be collected:

*   The device ID;
*   The version of the Application or the Web App installed on the user’s device;
*   The model of the user’s device; 
*   The version of the operating system on the user’s device; 
*   The battery level on the user’s device;
*   The language configured on the user’s device;
*   The device’s identifier for advertisers (IDFA/GAID); 
*   The Push identifier on the user’s device; 
*   The telephone operator;
*   The user’s country and continent;
*   The IP address.

Tracking tools and pixels will hereinafter be referred to, individually or collectively, as “Trackers.”
