==============

Updated: 05/11/2021

The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you about how HAPPN uses your personal data. We recommend you should read it carefully. However, please find an overview of the data collected and the reasons for its collection at the following link: [https://www.happn.com/en/privacy-basics/](https://www.happn.com/fr/privacy-basics/) 

1\. Definitions
---------------

**Application:** The HAPPN application, available on the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store and on the HAPPN Webapp: [https://app.happn.com](https://app.happn.com/) 

**Account:** The Member’s dedicated personal area within the Application, which he or she accesses when he or she registers and connects to the Application. It enables the Member to access the Services. A Member may only have one Account.

**Boost**: a function enabling Members to increase the visibility of their profile during the time that this option is activated.

**Crossing point:** your Geographical position, as recorded when you crossed paths with another Member, if the geolocation feature is enabled.

**Crush:** An event that is created between two profiles, triggered by a Like on both profiles. It represents mutual interest and sends out a “You have a Crush” notification, allowing Members to start a conversation.

**Facebook Connect:** A feature enabling Members to use their Facebook account to log in to the Application, in order to simplify the registration process.

**FlashNote (function only available in certain countries)**: a function that sends a notification to the Member to whom you address it, and which also enables you to send him or her a private, personalized message to start a private conversation.

**Geographical position:** your location, recorded by HAPPN and updated regularly when this option is enabled.

**HAPPN:** HAPPN, a French joint stock company (Société par Actions Simplifiée) registered with the Paris RCS (trade and companies registry) under no. 535 217 723, and owner and sole operator of the HAPPN application and trademark.

**Hello (Chat request):** Non-confidential function suggested before and/or after the Like which triggers a notification to the Member to whom you’re sending it and constitutes an invitation to chat with this person.

**Like**: An action represented by a heart, expressing interest. Premium Members have access to the list of Likes. Except for the first Like, this function remains hidden from non-Premium Members until they receive a reciprocal Like.

**Map (Mapping):** A map that allows you to find Members with whom you’ve crossed paths.

**Member:** A person registered with the Application. 

**Member characteristics**: Information provided by the Member describing his or her lifestyle and personal characteristics on the profile. The Member can choose the information he or she wishes to appear on the profile and filter other Members on the Application based on this information.

**Messages and/or voice messages:** Only Members who have a Crush (or a FlashNote, if eligible) can use the Application’s “Chat” function to send each other Messages. Messages are stored in the inbox, which is accessible via the icon on the top right of the homepage.

**Premium Member:** A Member who has a HAPPN Premium subscription.

**Profile Certification:** a function that enables the authentication of a Member’s Profile picture(s) to obtain the “Certified Profile” badge, which enables other Members to see that the photo of the Member’s face posted on his or her profile corresponds to his or her real visual identity while moving (via the video).

**Profile Photos:** photos on your profile enabling the easy identification of the Member. The Member accepts to, at the very least, provide a photo of his or her face in which he or she is clearly recognizable, and place it in first position. These two criteria combined are an essential condition for using the Services.

If the photo of the Member’s face is not placed in first position, it will be automatically placed in first position by default. If the Member has several photos of his or her face, he or she will be able to choose their order of appearance.

**Services:** All services, whether charged or free-of-charge, offered by HAPPN to encourage virtual or real-life meet-ups between Members who have crossed paths and who have a mutual interest in one another, according to the selected search criteria.  
**Shortlist:** A free feature enabling Members to access a selection of three profiles recommended by HAPPN every day. The Shortlist feature is available from Members’ third day of activity on their profiles.

**Video Call:** feature offered only to Members who have a Crush, enabling them to call and talk to each of their Crushes spontaneously, for a limited duration. This feature can be accessed from the “Messages” page, by clicking the icon in the top right corner to start the Video Call. During the Video Call, Members have access to the following options:

*   Pick up
    
*   Mute
    
*   Disable video
    
*   Switch to frontcam
    
*   Hang up

**3.1 Data you share directly** 

When you use our Services, **you share information with us**, some of which may be used to identify you. When you communicate this information, you accept that **some of the data will be visible to the other Members** of the Application, and therefore made public on the Application. In an effort to help you identify this information easily, it is signaled as ‘public’ below. HAPPN cannot be held liable for data published on its platform and disclosed by a Member. However, **information not marked as Public will not be visible or accessible by other Members**; such information is signaled as ‘private’ below. 

HAPPN collects and processes data relating to your registration and data relating to your interactions with HAPPN. 

**3.1.1. Registration data** 

_Information required for registering_

This is the basic data **required for you to register** and access our Services. 

This data is collected by HAPPN using different methods depending on the type of registration you choose. 

If you choose to **register using your Facebook, Apple or Google account, your data will be collected from the relevant platform** in an effort to reduce formalism. By selecting “Log in with Facebook/Apple/Google,” you agree to having these platforms provide us with such data.

In addition, **you can register using a cell phone number** and, if this is the case, your data will be **sent to HAPPN directly by you**. 

This data relates to your identity. 

Depending on how you registered, some data **must be collected in order to provide our Services.** If such data is not obtained, HAPPN will not be able to provide you with its Services via the Application, and you will not be able to create an Account. In all cases, your first name (public), age (public), birthdate (private), gender, and at least one Profile Photo (public) are required to register with the Application. Subsequently, you may add or remove Profile Photos at any time, providing you have added at least one Profile Photo containing a person’s face. As stated in paragraph 1, “Definitions,” the first Profile Photo should be a photo of a person’s face, otherwise one of your photos of your face will automatically be put in first position.

If you register using your phone number, you must provide said phone number in order to register.

When you register via Facebook, we must collect your first name and your age. You may also allow Facebook to provide HAPPN with your last name, birthdate, gender, email address, and to transfer your Profile Photos from Facebook.

When you register via Apple or Google, we must collect your first name and email address. Said platforms may also provide HAPPN with your last name.

In addition, if you refuse the geolocation feature when registering, and thereby the possibility for HAPPN to collect your location data to suggest Member profiles with whom you have crossed paths, you must provide the name of your city. This information will enable HAPPN to suggest Member profiles near you.

_Optional information_ _to complete your profile_ 

You may add additional information to improve your profile. This information is optional, shared at your own discretion, and is your sole responsibility. You can add this information directly to your profile on the Application and/or via Facebook Connect by syncing your Account with Facebook. This data is as follows: 

*   **professional career and education (public)**: profession or studies;

*   **interests and habits (public):** personal preferences, leisure activities, musical preferences, lifestyle, Member Characteristics;
    

*   **height (public);**

*   **profile description (public)**: if you would like to, you can share additional information about you in the space provided for this purpose. This information will be visible to HAPPN Members. Moreover, if you so wish, you can also answer the questions on your lifestyle (personality traits, sports, travel, type of meeting expected, etc.).

Your description is a free text area, **HAPPN does not encourage Members to share data that can be perceived as sensitive with other Members, or with HAPPN through the Application.** Sensitive data refers to data that is legally qualified as “sensitive” by the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). More specifically, it includes information on race or ethnicity, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs or affiliation with a union, along with information on health, sexual life or sexual preferences (“Sensitive Data”). If a **Member decides to share such information on his/her profile regardless, it is deemed to have been “clearly made public”** by the Member who shared it, according to the GDPR. 

**3.1.2. Data relating to interactions with HAPPN**: 

When you contact our customer or support services, report an issue with our services, ask for help, exercise your personal data rights, or participate in promotional activities, games, competitions or surveys, when you share your experience of our services, give testimonies, or answer one of our questionnaires, HAPPN will collect, depending on the case, the following personal data: 

*   **Data relating to reports and requests sent to the HAPPN customer service (private):** Date and time of the report, nature and reason for the report, data relating to the reported user. Furthermore, proof of identity may be requested as part of the exercise of your rights over your personal data, and for safety/confidentiality reasons.

This data will be collected by HAPPN when you ask for help from our customer service, exercise your rights over your personal data, report a problem or another user. Such information **is required to handle reports or answer your requests.** This information will also be handled if a **report is made about you**. In fact, HAPPN has a legal obligation to collect reports from its Members brought to its knowledge regarding contents or behavior likely to infringe our Terms of Service.

*   **Data relating to taking part in games and competitions, to your experience and satisfaction (private)**: participation, responses, satisfaction level, suggestions, experience.

Such data is collected by HAPPN when you take part in our games and competitions, answer our surveys and satisfaction questionnaires, share your experiences. This data **is mandatory if you wish to take part in the games and competitions organized by HAPPN**. Without this data, HAPPN may not register you for games or competitions. However, data on your experiences and satisfaction is optional.

**3.2 Data we collect automatically**

When you use our services and features, we collect information on your activities on the Application: 

*   **Activity data (private)** (registration date, login dates, on or offline status, interactions with Members and third-party accounts, number of transactions, notifications received, notification preferences, etc.) 
    

When you access our Services and use the Application and its features, information on the way you use them is collected and processed. **Most of the information collected by HAPPN is necessary to the provision of its Services.** Without this data HAPPN cannot supply the Services linked to the HAPPN application. 

More specifically, this includes your registration date, login dates, on or offline status, the type and number of interactions with other Members (such as FlashNotes, Hellos, Likes, crossings, and Crushes), with the third-party accounts connected to your Account (such as Spotify, Instagram), or the number of transactions made (purchases of Hellos, FlashNotes, or subscriptions), notifications received and notification preferences. 

*   **Geographical positions and Crossing points with other Members (public)**

The Application’s main value and purpose is to allow Members to find other Members they have or may have crossed paths. Your Geographical position is collected **with your express consent only.** In fact, you will be asked to authorize the collection and processing of your location data to allow HAPPN to identify your crossing points with other Members who have agreed to be geolocated.

Unless you have chosen stricter settings on your device, HAPPN will collect your Geographical position regularly.

When the Geographical positions of two Members are within a certain radius, HAPPN pinpoints a Crossing point.

Your Crossing points will be displayed on your profile, but **Members with whom you cross paths can never see your exact location.** Each Member sees his/her location when the Crossing point was registered in a radius defined by HAPPN. They cannot see the other Member’s location.

During your registration, if you do not provide your consent for geolocation, you must provide the name of your city. This information will enable HAPPN to suggest profiles of Members near you.

These Crossing points can be displayed as a news feed or on a Map (Mapping).

  
You may, at any time, **withdraw your consent** by disabling geolocation on your smartphone. If you choose to do so, your news feed will no longer be updated, and you will not be able to see who you have crossed paths with after disabling the geolocation option. When you have no more profiles in your newsfeed, we will ask you the name of your city in order to suggest new Member profiles near you.

You can also ask that your profile, and therefore your crossing points, are no longer displayed on the Map (Mapping). In this case, you will only appear in the news feed of other Members. Equally, you will no longer be able to see the profiles of Members you have crossed paths with on the Map (Mapping); you will only see these profiles on your news feed. For this, go to the application and click on “My preferences” then go to the bottom of your screen and disable the option “Share my crossing cluster”.

*   **Text messages and voice messages sent and received (private)**

Messages are sent and stored on HAPPN’s servers, to provide the Service to allow Members with a Crush to have a conversation or when a Member uses the FlashNote function. **Messages and voice messages are strictly private** and only implicate the Members involved. HAPPN’s authorized managers do not exercise any rights to view these conversations. These Messages are not transmitted or communicated to third parties except in cases of judicial requests, and/or in compliance with the applicable legislative or regulatory provisions. Moreover, Messages are strictly private and are not accessible to other Members who are not involved in the conversation, nor to any third party. 

*   **Information relating to Video Calls** (start and end time/date of calls, etc.) **(private)**
    

If you wish to make a Video Call using HAPPN, your telephone’s technical data is required in order to establish communication between the two Members. HAPPN will collect the start and end time/date of Video Calls, but not their content. Such Video Calls are instant.

*   **Search preferences - people whom you would like to cross paths with (age and gender) (private)**

The Application lets you set preferences by age, gender, and the Member Characteristics they have provided. You can change these settings in the Application and specify the age range and Member Characteristics, and, after agreeing to HAPPN collecting and processing your data, the gender of people you are looking for, so you can be matched exclusively with profiles you crossed paths with and who meet your search criteria. You will then only see the Members you have crossed paths with and who share your search preferences on your news feed. 

*   **Technical data of the cell phone or device** (IP, mobile ID, application version, telephone version and model advertisement ID, etc.) **(private)**

We collect information from the devices and equipment you use to access our Services, including server logs, which may contain information such as IP addresses, version of the application, device version and model, language used, operating system, application crashes, and advertisement ID. Data may be collected with cookies or other tracking tools: to learn more about this, please refer to our document on the [Use of Cookies](http://www.happn.com/cookies). 

**Transaction Data: HAPPN does not collect or process any banking data.** Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store have opted to refrain from sending certain types data to mobile applications, which includes any banking and financial information. This data is collected and processed solely by the above platforms, and HAPPN does not have the option of changing this payment method. The only information exchanged between HAPPN and Apple’s App Store or Google’s Play Store is technical data that does not allow us to identify you (for example, a transaction number), and is used to validate transactions. HAPPN will therefore retain a history of your purchases and subscriptions but will not store any information relating to the payment methods you use.

9\. How long will we keep your data?
------------------------------------

HAPPN has introduced a process for automatically deleting your account and your personal data with regard to the storage time limits defined below. When certain data must be stored for statistical uses beyond these storage time limits, this data is anonymized irreversibly to ensure you can no longer be identified.

  
HAPPN will store the Member’s data for as long as required in order for the Member to use his/her Account, namely: 

*   For the **length of the Member’s registration, plus one year**. After one year of inactivity on an Account, the Account will be deleted and the Member’s data will be retained for another year, before being permanently destroyed or irreversibly anonymized. An account is considered inactive when the Application of the Member has not established contact with HAPPN’s servers (including due to deactivation of the geolocation process); and the Member has not used the Application. In any event, the Account of a Premium Member is not considered inactive. Furthermore, please note that in accordance with its status as a hosting provider, HAPPN has a legal obligation to retain some of its Members’ personal data for a period of one year based on Article 6, II of the French Trust in the Digital Economy Act (_Loi pour la Confiance dans l’Économie Numérique_) of 21 June 2004.
*   When **a Member is banned, his/her Account becomes inactive.** Information from this Account is retained in an active database for one year, in order cross check it with information provided with new registrations to the Application, in order to prevent, to the extent possible, banned users from registering again. Subsequently, the personal data is archived for one more year, after which it is deleted permanently or irreversibly anonymized.
*   When **the Member deletes his/her Account or requests its deletion** from Customer Service, it will be deleted from the Application. However, the Member’s data will be kept in a separate archive for one year before being permanently destroyed or irreversibly anonymized, in order to enable HAPPN to comply with its obligation to keep it as host.
*   Some of the Member’s data, such as email address and telephone number, will be **retained for prospecting** or Marketing purposes (see Article 4.3) or to be analyzed in order to improve and optimize our service (see Article 4.4) for one year after an Account has been inactive for one year. If a Member deletes his/her Account, this data will not be used for prospecting or marketing purposes.

With regard to your Geographical Positions and Crossing Points, shorter storage times apply:

\-  Your Geographical Positions are stored for one month from their collection in order to determine your Crossing Points with other Members;

\- Your Crossing Points are stored for six months from their collection in order to display the Profiles of Members you have crossed on the Application.

HAPPN undertakes to make every effort and to invest all means at its disposal to guarantee that the stored data is kept as secure as possible. However, it is the Member’s responsibility to take appropriate measures to protect his/her data.
