Article 1: Scope 
-----------------

The TOS define the rights and obligations of the parties when using the Application. They form the basis of the contractual relationship between the Member and HAPPN.

**1.1 Conflicting Rules**

These Terms of Service (TOS) determine the main rules of use for the Application. They are supplemented by additional policies – the [Privacy Policy](http://www.happn.com/privacy), the [Cookies Use Policy](http://www.happn.com/cookies) and the [Confidence Charter](http://www.happn.com/trust) – in order to provide the Member with clearer guidance on how to use the Application. In the event of a conflict between the various policies making the rules inaccessible, unintelligible and/or unpredictable, these TOS shall prevail over the Privacy Policy, the Cookies Use Policy and the Confidence Charter. 

**1.2 Independence of Provisions**

Should any provision of these TOS be declared invalid or inapplicable due to the effects of a law, regulation or ruling by a court with relevant jurisdiction, the other provisions shall remain effective and in force, unless these TOS become distorted, or the obligations of the parties significantly thrown out of balance. 

Article 2: Amendments to the TOS
--------------------------------

**2.1 Updates**

HAPPN reserves the right, unilaterally and at any time, to add to or amend these TOS as it sees fit or to terminate the Services. 

The Member will be informed of updates to the TOS via the Application and/or by email sent to the address provided by the Member. It is the Member’s responsibility to ensure that this email address is valid.

It is the Member’s responsibility to carefully read the updated TOS and to be fully aware of any changes ensuing from said updates.

Complete acceptance of the changes is implied by the Member’s continued use of the Application’s Services following the updates.

Should the Member not agree with changes made to the TOS, he or she has the option to end the Services and delete his or her Account as per Article 15.3.

**2.2 Immediate Effect**

All new versions of the TOS shall be effective immediately for all Members.

Article 3: Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
-----------------------------------------------

**3.1 Governing Law**

These TOS shall be governed by French law, exclusive of its conflict of laws rules.  

**3.2 Dispute Resolution**

In the case of dispute, the Member agrees to contact HAPPN directly in writing (by email or letter, to the email or postal address provided in article 16 hereof) prior to taking any judicial or extra-judicial action, in order to try and find an amicable settlement to this dispute.

In the case of failure, the Member is informed that he or she may choose to have recourse to mediation, free of charge, and submit its dispute to the Online Dispute Resolution platform proposed by the European Commission, which may be accessed at the following address: [http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/](http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/).

Any challenge or dispute related to the formation, interpretation, performance or expiry of these TOS or in any connection therewith which has not been amicably settled shall be submitted to the relevant courts of Paris (France).

Article 4: Registration

Registration can be done in these ways:

\- via the Facebook Connect: the social network enables HAPPN to use the Member’s profile photo, first name, age calculated based on date of birth in order to create a “profile” page.  Consequently, the Member must check the accuracy of his or her Facebook  information before registering with the Service.

\- via a cell phone number: in this case, no information on the Member may be automatically retrieved and it is his or her responsibility to supply personal information such as first and last name, sex, date of birth as well as other additional information if desired and one or more personal photos at the time of registration.

This Application is for personal and recreational use only. Each Member is free to talk to and form relationships with other Members in compliance with these TOS and the law.

The Services offered by HAPPN may in no case be likened to a counseling or marriage bureau service. Its sole aim is to facilitate virtual or real-life meet-ups through the Application between Members with mutual interests, according to their locations and preferences.

Article 6: Protection of Personal Data
--------------------------------------

HAPPN is very concerned with the protection of your personal data and the respect of your privacy. We suggest that you read our Privacy Policy and our Confidence Charter carefully to better understand how we process your personal data, available by clicking on the following links: 

• [Privacy Policy](https://www.happn.com/privacy)

• [Confidence Charter](https://www.happn.com/trust)

Article 7: HAPPN’s Obligations and Liability
--------------------------------------------

**7.1 Technical Resources and Security**

HAPPN agrees to provide the infrastructure and technical resources to provide a high-quality service to Members with an iPhone device running operating system version iOS 10 or higher, an Android Smartphone running version 5 or higher.

HAPPN cannot be held liable for any operating fault on the Member’s device or for any compatibility issue between the Application and the device.

In addition, every effort is made to ensure that the risks of fraudulent access to HAPPN’s system are minimized.  In this respect, HAPPN uses a firewall or equipment located between the Internet and the company’s private network, in order to make its security more robust by filtering traffic to and from the internet. It is, however, impossible to fully guarantee the security of a network. 

HAPPN is not responsible for any failures, interruptions or poor performance of the Member’s internet provider Services, or for any cause beyond HAPPN’s control which might interrupt or have an adverse effect on access to HAPPN Services.

The Member must have access to a secure email account. If such a precaution is not taken, or even if it is, while this probability remains low, the Member’s Account may be vulnerable to fraud. 

HAPPN shall also endeavor to avert Members of any exceptional risk of receiving spam Messages or Messages claiming to have been sent by HAPPN. The Member must be attentive and vigilant in order to avoid being the victim of scams and report any of the above circumstances to HAPPN by sending a letter or email to the address provided in Article 16 hereof.

**7.2 Illegal Conduct** 

HAPPN and its partners cannot be held liable for actions by its Members which are illegal or which incur criminal penalties, including but not limited to:

• All types of scams, 

• All activities of a commercial or professional nature,

• Prostitution,

• Identity theft,

• An infringement of a third-party intellectual property right,

• An infringement of personal rights, such as image rights and the respect of the right to privacy. 

**7.3 Reporting and Community Moderation System**

As a hosting provider and pursuant to Article 6.I-7 of the French Trust in the Digital Economy Act of June 21, 2004, HAPPN has no legal obligation to monitor the content sent or stored via the Application.

However, according to Article 6.I-3 of this law, as a hosting provider, HAPPN must set up a reporting and community moderation system in order to report some unlawful, abusive and prejudicial content.

In such case and after due verification by Customer Service, HAPPN commits to promptly remove the said content.

Pursuant to Article 6.I-5 of the French Trust in the Digital Economy Act: the knowledge of illicit content is deemed effective when the hosting provider is notified of following:

• The notification date

• The content transmitter’s identity

• The description of the facts in contention (possibly with screen shots of the content)

• As well as the reasons for which the content must be removed.

HAPPN has therefore equipped the Application with a reporting and community moderation system, allowing Members to report the content described in Article 6.I-7 of the French Trust in the Digital Economy Act if it constitutes apology for crimes against humanity, apology for and incitement to terrorism, incitement to racial hatred, incitement to hatred based on gender, sexual orientation or handicap and inter alia child pornography, incitement to violence against women and violation of human dignity.

Guided by an extremely strict professional ethic and refusing any association with violent or insulting Members as well as unlawful, abusive or prejudicial content, HAPPN’s team takes this reporting procedure very seriously, which may also be implemented in the case of statements contrary to accepted social etiquette.

Hence, when the content published by a Member is reported, including using the Vidéo Call feature, the transmitter’s account can be suspended or terminated according to the conditions set forth in Article 15.4. This decision is based on the proof given by the report’s author and is made in order to ensure the withdrawal of the content in compliance with HAPPN’s legal obligations.

The Member having originally published the reported content will in no case be informed of the identity of the report’s author.

Outside the scope of this reporting system, the Member can decide to block another Member whose conduct does not comply with the rules of etiquette in order to prevent any conversation with him or her (mutual prevention of access to Likes, Hellos, FlashNotes (if eligible), Messages and voice messages that have been sent in the past and of sending any messages in the future, or being alerted of the presence of a Member who has been blocked, particularly if they think this Member is bothering them in one way or another).  This action is confidential and enables Members to control the Members with whom they want to keep in touch or not.  

This reporting system is accessible and operational: 

• On an iPhone: at the top right of the Member’s profile photo, and at the top right of the conversation with the Member in question;

• On an Android Smartphone: at the top right of the Member’s profile photo, and at the top right of the conversation with the Member in question;

Should content be published that was reported and that may be seen as a violation of law or regulations, the Member who is a victim of this content is encouraged to submit a complaint to the appropriate police authorities.

The reporting system put in place by HAPPN does not replace any complaint and judicial procedure against a Member who authored the reported content. 

Any misuse of the community moderation system or any unjustified reporting of a Member shall be considered a breach of these TOS, and penalties may be imposed including Account suspension/termination, pursuant to Article 15.4 of the TOS, besides application of penalties pursuant to Article 6.I-4 of the French Trust in the Digital Economy Act or even legal proceedings, under which damages may have to be paid to victims.

**7.4 Duty of Caution**

The Member is solely liable for checking the identity of the people with whom he or she wishes to arrange a “real-life” meet-up. HAPPN may not be held liable for any problems whatsoever arising from a “real-life” meet-up.

Similarly, the Member is solely liable for checking the identity of the Crush with whom they may want to engage in a Video Call and organize a “virtual” meetup. HAPPN may not be held liable for any incidents occurring during a “virtual” meetup.

**7.5 Group Events**

Any use of HAPPN Services to organize a group meeting of its Members constitutes a misuse of the Service. This is why using the Application to plan or organize a demonstration in a public place is strictly prohibited. Should such a meeting take place, HAPPN may not be held liable in the case of a public order offense or any damage caused by such meeting.

Article 8: Member Code of Conduct 
----------------------------------

**8.1 Duty of Fairness and Honesty when Registering**

For the duration of the investigation, HAPPN reserves the right to suspend the Account of any Member giving cause for suspicion as well as his or her access to the Application, and to conduct the necessary checks, in particular by asking him or her to send a copy of an official ID. The Member will be informed of the suspension of his or her Account via the application and/or by email to the address given by the Member pursuant to Article 15.4 hereof.

Should the Member be unable to provide said proof, or in the case of a proven offense under these TOS, HAPPN may terminate the Account of the Member in question in accordance with the conditions set out by Article 15.4 hereof. 

The Member agrees to have only one single account. Failing that, HAPPN may terminate the additional accounts, under the conditions described in article 15.4 hereof.

• Refrain from posting any confidential information about others such as financial data.

Especially when using the Video Call feature, and in addition to the rules above, Members also commit to abide by the following terms of use:

• Refrain from transmitting or exchanging fixed and/or animated content of an offensive, sexually explicit, illegal, dangerous, violent, bullying, disrespectful, defamatory or threatening nature;

• Refrain from using the Video Call feature:

(i) for gambling, games of chance, lotteries or sweepstakes;

(ii) for the promotion of gambling, games of chance, lotteries or sweepstakes;

(iii) for the promotion, encouragement or facilitation of any illegal activity or activity violating the rights of a third party (including, but not limited to intellectual and industrial property rights, right to privacy and to personality);

(iv) to attempt to circumvent the feature’s safety measures or to use the feature for purposes other than the ones it is intended for, i.e., calling and communicating with your Crush spontaneously via video call for a limited duration.

• Refrain from using the feature other than in an interactive, instant way, or from making any fixed and/or animated recording of the Video Call using any media.

**8.3 Personal Use**

The Member agrees to use the Application solely for personal use. The HAPPN network must not be exploited for commercial, promotional, electoral or recruitment purposes. It is strictly prohibited to send Messages of a marketing and/or commercial nature and/or newsletters via the HAPPN inbox, including but not limited to content, guidelines or hyperlinks to third-party sites or materials, particularly those of HAPPN’s competitors. 

**8.4 Member’s Liability**

The Member is only liable for his or her own actions and for the data that he or she publishes via the Application.

Should HAPPN be held liable for any failure by the Member to comply with its obligations, the Member shall hold HAPPN harmless against any conviction made against it regarding the Member’s infringement of the law or of these TOS.

The Member may report unlawful content which violates French law or these TOS using the moderation tools provided by the Application in accordance with Article 7.3 hereof. 

**8.5 Photos**

All photos of a pornographic or exhibitionist nature, or which violate modesty and are generally offensive to moral values are strictly prohibited. The publication of such photos will be considered a serious offense which can lead to the suspension and/or termination of the Member’s Account, in addition to any other penalties that may be imposed by the courts.

**8.6 Real-life Meet-ups**

HAPPN advises Members who wish to arrange “real-life” meet-ups to be vigilant.  Members are solely responsible for verifying the identity of those with whom they meet. “Real-life” meet-ups are arranged independently of HAPPN and are the sole responsibility of Members. HAPPN cannot be held liable for any acts or problems of any type which have been committed or caused by Members and/or former Members when such events occur following use of the Application.  In this respect, one of the intended benefits of the HAPPN messaging service, again to ensure that Members remain safe and free from harassment, is to enable Members to decide which people should be allowed to see their profiles and talk to them. 

As regards the people with whom the Member has agreed to exchange Messages, it is recommended that Members do not too readily reveal information which is not included in the profile such as a phone number, address or surname.  For safety reasons, HAPPN strongly advises that real-life meetings be arranged only in busy public places or that a friend or relative be informed of the meeting and that Members disclose their contact information only after a reasonable period of time.

**8.7 Account Management**

The Member must regularly consult his or her inbox and notifications, which HAPPN will use inter alia to keep the Member updated on information pertaining to its Services. This information may also be sent to the Member’s email address obtained through Facebook Connect or directly provided by the Member when registering with a cell phone number, or via Apple, Google Sign in, or via the HAPPN Webapp.

The Member may access the Services of his or her Account by connecting to the Application using a confidential user name and password. The Member is solely responsible for his or her login information and must ensure that no third party may access them. In particular, the Member shall specifically hold HAPPN harmless against any communication, use or declaration made using his or her Account.

**8.8 Equipment**

The cost of equipment (hardware or software) required to access the Services together with all other costs related thereto, including telecommunications costs, shall be borne solely by the Member.  The Member is solely responsible for the hardware used to access the Service.

Article 9: Charged Services

A missed call does not count as a used Video Call. However, a Video Call is deemed used as soon as the Members are in communication.

In the event of breach of the TOS or a legal provision by the Member, HAPPN has the right to terminate the contract, effective immediately and without prejudice. HAPPN is not required to justify its decision to terminate to the Member.

In all cases, no reimbursement will be made if the Member is a HAPPN Premium subscriber or has purchased Packs (of Hellos and/or FlashNotes (if eligible) and/or Video Calls and/or Boosts).

Article 10: Scope of the Offer 
-------------------------------

**10.1 Hello and Videos Calls and Boost Validity Period**

Hellos and/or Video Calls and/or Boosts purchased and/or offered by HAPPN may only be used for the term during which the Account remains active, in compliance with the TOS.  In the event of early termination of the Account pursuant to Article 15.3, 15.4 or 15.5 hereafter, any remaining Hellos and/or Vidéo Calls and/or Boosts at the date of termination or deletion of the Member Account shall be permanently deleted from the Member Account, without compensation of any kind.

A subsequent re-registration of the Member will not allow him or her to recover the lost Hellos and/Video Calls and/or Boosts.

HAPPN may offer Hellos and/or Video Calls to Members as part of its loyalty program or for a special event. 

**10.2 FlashNote Validity Period (if eligible)**

FlashNotes purchased and/or offered by HAPPN may only be used for the term during which the Account remains active, in compliance with the TOS. In the event of early termination of the Account pursuant to Article 15.3, 15.4 or 15.5 hereafter, any remaining FlashNotes at the date of termination or deletion of the Member Account shall be permanently deleted from the Member Account, without compensation of any kind.

A subsequent re-registration of the Member will not allow him or her to recover the lost FlashNotes. HAPPN may offer FlashNotes to Members as part of its loyalty program or for a special event.

**10.3 Cumulative Offers**

Packs of Hellos (or FlashNotes if eligible), or Packs of Video Calls and Boosts are cumulative. The number of Hellos (or FlashNotes if eligible), or Video Calls and Boosts in each Pack purchased is added to the Hellos (or FlashNotes if eligible), Video Calls and Boosts already in the Member’s Account.

Packs of Hellos (or FlashNotes if eligible) and/or Packs of Video Calls are also cumulative with subscriptions, meaning that they allow users to benefit from more Hellos (or FlashNotes if eligible) and/or Video Calls than those to which Premium Members have access.

Article 12: Sponsoring

HAPPN allows its Members to invite friends to join the Application in order to widen the network and increase their chances of meeting someone. In return, Members who sponsor a new user receive Hellos as a gift. Sponsorship by Members is limited to a small circle of friends, relatives whom they actually know in real life. Consequently, group recommendations outside this circle are strictly prohibited.

The trademark is protected by Articles L713-2 et seq. of the French Intellectual Property Code (Code de la propriété intellectuelle) currently in force in France, and this protection is international.

**13.2 Prerogatives related to Copyright**

Any representation and/or reproduction and/or distribution and/or partial and/or total exploitation of the content and Services provided by the Application, such as for example the software, animations, text, photos, videos, graphics and more broadly the general structure, through any method whatsoever and in any form whatsoever, in any format or through any medium whatsoever, is strictly prohibited without HAPPN’s prior, express and written authorization, and may give rise to legal proceedings.

These original works are protected by Articles L335-3 et seq. of the French Intellectual Property Code (Code de la propriété intellectuelle) currently in force in France, and this protection is international.

**13.3 License**

The usage rights granted by HAPPN to the Member are restricted to private and personal use. Any other use by the Member is prohibited without HAPPN’s prior, express and written authorization. 

The Member grants HAPPN and its partners a free-of-charge, non-exclusive, international and permanent license for the use, reproduction, representation, modification and translation of any basic intellectual property-related component and personality rights (including rights of image, name, and voice) (text, photos, videos, etc.) that it may provide through the Application for the non-exclusive purpose of communicating with other Members.

HAPPN shall use this license in a manner which complies with image rights, respect of personality attributes, and respect of the right to privacy which protects the user’s personal data, without misrepresenting the true nature of the Member’s profile and therefore in keeping with this profile. This license permits HAPPN to ensure that these components are compatible with its technical performance or the required media formats. These rights are granted on an international basis and throughout the performance of these TOS between the Member and HAPPN. 

The Member shall retain ownership of any content and personal data that he or she provides.

The Member shall hold HAPPN harmless against any legal action, appeal or conviction brought against him or her due to his or her infringement of a third party’s intellectual property rights. The Member shall hold HAPPN harmless against any claims or damages which may result from it including, but not limited to, requests for compensation. 

As part of the Profile recommendation service, the Member grants HAPPN the same rights and guarantees of use as described in the aforementioned license. This is to enable the sending of the indicative selection of three profiles to other Members via the Application and via an editorial or themed newsletter sent by email. It should be noted that this list of recommendations may be different to the one the Member may find in their Profile on the HAPPN Application as Profiles are continuously refined based on their relevance and status.

Article 14: Counterfeiting, Unfair Competition and Parasitism

It is strictly prohibited to design a product similar to the Application or to create a derivative, and more generally to be guilty of parasitism, imitation, a smear campaign or any other act of unfair competition. HAPPN reserves the right, in this case, to serve a writ on the Member in question in view of obtaining compensation for the injury caused by the Member.

Additionally, the Member who succeeds in or attempts to grant licenses or sub-licenses, or to sell, resell, transfer, assign, distribute or commercially exploit in any other way, or to make available the Services or Application to a third party in any way shall risk serious legal penalties.

In case of breach of TOS by the Member, his or her account can at any time be suspended as a safeguard measure and then terminated as of right by HAPPN.

HAPPN will be entitled to suspend a Member’s account as long as necessary to allow HAPPN’s customer service team to make all investigations necessary following the report as required by Article 7.3 hereof or in case of presumed breach of TOS which may be remediated.

The Member is invited to contact HAPPN customer service by email in order to obtain more information on the reasons for the suspension and in order to provide explanations and/or bring the proof that the breach has been remediated.

If within 30 days following the notification of the account suspension, the Member has not contacted HAPPN customer service, or if the elements given by the Members did not help to remedy the breach, HAPPN will be entitled to notify the Member of termination of his or Account via the Application and/or by email and inform the Member of the period in which he or she cannot re-register for the Application.  Unless stated otherwise, the duration of such removal is set at 1 year from the notification of termination of the Account.

The Member will not be able to create another account for a maximum 1-year period from the notification of the Account termination. 

**15.5 Termination of Inactive Accounts by HAPPN**

HAPPN will delete inactive accounts as defined below.

An account is considered inactive if after a continuous period of one year, both of the following conditions are met:

• The Application of the Member did not establish contact with HAPPN’s servers (including because of deactivation of the geolocation process); and

• The Member has not used the Application. In any event, the Account of a Premium Member is not considered inactive.

The Member will be informed by email sent to the address given in the Application of the deletion of his or her account subject to prior notice of eight (8) days.

During the period of notice, the Member may reactivate his or her Account, which results in the suspension of the termination procedure. All content from the Member’s profile will then be preserved.

Once the Account has been deleted:

• The Member’s profile will be made invisible to other Members.

• The Member’s data shall be retained for one year as of this date, as regards in particular the legal obligations incumbent upon HAPPN in accordance with the terms set out by Article 9 of the Privacy Policy, and shall be permanently deleted thereafter.
