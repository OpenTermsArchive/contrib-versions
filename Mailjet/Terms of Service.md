Your obligations under this Section include claims arising out of the acts or omissions of your employees or agents, any other person to whom you have given access to the Customer Configuration, and any person who gains access to the Customer Configuration as a result of your failure to use reasonable security precautions, even if the acts or omissions of such persons were not authorized by you.

**10.2** Mailgun will choose legal counsel to defend the claim, provided that the choice is reasonable and is communicated to you. You must comply with our reasonable requests for assistance and cooperation in the defense of the claim.

Neither party may assign the Agreement or any Service Orders without the prior written consent of the other party except to an Affiliate or successor as part of a corporate reorganization or a sale of some or all of its business, provided the assigning party notifies the other party of such change of control. Mailgun may use its Affiliates or subcontractors to perform all or any part of the Services, but Mailgun remains responsible under the Agreement for work performed by its Affiliates and subcontractors to the same extent as if Mailgun performed the Services itself.

You acknowledge and agree that Mailgun Affiliates and subcontractors may be based outside of the geographic jurisdiction in which you have chosen to store Customer Data and if legally required the parties will enter into good faith negotiations of such agreements as are necessary in order to legitimize the transfer of Customer Data.

**14\. FORCE MAJEURE**

Neither party will be in violation of the Agreement if the failure to perform the obligation is due to an extraordinary event beyond its control, such as significant failure of a part of the power grid, Internet failure, natural disaster, war, riot, epidemic, strikes or labor action, terrorism (“Force Majeure”).

If a Force Majeure event occurs, this Agreement shall be automatically suspended during the time the Force Majeure event continues, and neither Party shall be liable to the other for non-performance or delay in the performance of required obligation(s) due to the Force Majeure event, provided the non-performing Party gives prompt written notice of its inability to perform specified obligation(s) due to the event and uses reasonable efforts to resume its performance of its obligation(s) as soon as possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall a Force Majeure event excuse or delay a Party’s obligation(s) with respect to confidentiality or Intellectual Property Rights.

**15\. GOVERNING LAW**  
**15.1** The Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Texas, USA, exclusive of any choice of law principle that would require the application of the law of a different jurisdiction, and the laws of the United States of America including the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §1, et seq. Any dispute or claim relating to or arising out of the Agreement shall be submitted to binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted in the state and county (or equivalent geographic location) of the non-asserting party’s principal business offices in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in effect at the time the dispute or claim arose. The arbitration shall be conducted by one arbitrator from AAA or a comparable arbitration service. The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned award with findings of fact and conclusions of law. Either party may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration under this Agreement, or to enforce an arbitration award. Neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both parties.

Either party shall be permitted to appeal the final award under the AAA’s Optional Appellate Arbitration Rules in effect at the time the dispute or claim arose. Grounds for vacating the award shall include, in addition to those enumerated under the Federal Arbitration Act, that the arbitrator committed errors of law that are material and prejudicial. The appeal shall be determined upon the written documents submitted by the parties, with no oral argument. After the appellate rights described herein have been exercised or waived, the parties shall have no further right to challenge the award.

**15.2** Notwithstanding the exclusive jurisdiction provision above, you agree that Mailgun may seek to enforce any judgment anywhere in the world where you may have assets. No claim may be brought as a class or collective action, nor may you assert such a claim as a member of a class or collective action that is brought by another claimant. Each of us agrees that Mailgun will not bring a claim under the Agreement more than two years after the time that the claim accrued. The Agreement shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.

**15.3** The prevailing party in any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement shall be entitled to recover reasonable legal fees and costs, including attorney’s fees.

**16\. MISCELLANEOUS**

**16.1** Some terms are incorporated into the Agreement by reference to pages on the Mailgun website and Mailgun may revise those terms from time to time (including these Terms of Service). Such revisions will be effective and supersede and form part of the Agreement as of the time (i) you enter into a new Service Order referencing the terms subject to the revisions or (ii) a Service Order automatically renews pursuant to the Agreement in which case you acknowledge that you have reviewed and accept the then-current version of the terms as of the date of the renewal. If there is a conflict between the terms of the Agreement, the documents will govern in the following order: the Service Order, then these Terms of Service. The headings or captions in the Agreement are for convenience only. If over time you enter into multiple Agreements for a given Customer Configuration (for example to add additional components or services) then the most recent terms referenced in the Service Order(s) will govern the entirety of the Services for the given Customer Configuration.

**16.2** Unless otherwise expressly permitted in the Agreement the terms of the Agreement may be varied only by a written agreement signed by both parties that expressly refers to the Agreement. A Service Order may be amended to modify, add, or remove services by a formal written agreement signed by both parties, or by an exchange of correspondence (including via the Mailgun ticketing system) that includes the express consent of an authorized individual for each of us. The pre-printed terms of your purchase order or other business form or terms that you provide shall be void and of no effect.

**16.3** If any part of the Agreement is found unenforceable, the rest of the Agreement will continue in effect, and the unenforceable part shall be reformed to the extent possible to make it enforceable and give business efficacy to the Agreement. Each party may enforce its respective rights under the Agreement even if it has waived the right or failed to enforce the same or other rights in the past. The relationship between the parties is that of independent contractors and not business partners. Neither party is the agent for the other and neither party has the right to bind the other on any agreement with a third party.

**16.4** The following provisions in these Terms of Service shall survive expiration or termination of the Agreement: Intellectual Property, Confidential Information, Indemnification, Limitation on Damages, Governing Law, Notices, Miscellaneous, all terms of the Agreement requiring you to pay any fees for Services provided prior to the time of expiration or termination, or requiring you to pay an early termination fee, and any other provisions that by their nature are intended to survive expiration or termination of the Agreement.

**16.5** The Agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive understanding between the parties regarding its subject matter and supersedes and replaces any prior or contemporaneous representation(s), agreement(s) or understanding(s), written or oral.
