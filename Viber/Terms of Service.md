These Terms of Service (“**Terms**”) govern your use of the Viber App, Viber Website and any services, features, platforms of products offered by Viber, as detailed below. These Terms form a legally binding contract between you and Viber Media S.a.r.l. (“**Viber**“, “**our**“, “**we**” or “**us**“). Please read them carefully, we have tried our best to strip the legalese from the Terms, however, there are places where they may still read like a traditional contract as they are a legally binding agreement between you and Viber. These Terms incorporate and are governed by the [**Acceptable Use Policy**](https://www.viber.com/en/terms/viber-public-content-policy/) (**“AUP”**) and the [**Viber Privacy Policy**](https://www.viber.com/en/terms/viber-privacy-policy/).

PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS THE SERVICES OR INSTALL THE VIBER APP IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OR ANY PART OF THE TERMS.

**U.S ARBITRATION NOTICE:** THESE TERMS CONTAIN AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE. YOU AGREE THAT, EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS, DISPUTES BETWEEN US WILL BE RESOLVED BY MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION, AND YOU AND VIBER WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.

**ACCESS TO EMERGENCY SERVICES:** Our Services are not a replacement for your ordinary mobile or fixed line telephone, nor are they intended to support or carry emergency calls to any type of hospital, law enforcement agencies, medical care unit or any type of emergency services of any kind. In particular, with the exception of Viber Out, our Services do not allow you to make such calls and Viber is not liable in any manner for such calls or inability to place such calls. You must and it is your responsibility to ensure that you have access to alternative communication for placing such emergency calls if needed.

**CHANGES TO THE TERMS:** We are always working on adding additional features to our Services and improving our existing products. As such, and since there may be changes to applicable laws, we may update or change our Services, including their functionality from time to time, and revise and reissue these Terms occasionally to reflect our Services and practices correctly. We will only make changes if the provisions are no longer appropriate or incomplete. Unless otherwise required by law, we will provide you with 30 days prior written notice (e.g., through the App, the Website or by e-mail). We will also update the date at the top of our Terms and enable you to re-visit the older version of the Terms at any time. Changes to these Terms shall become effective upon the completion of the 30 days’ notice. Once updated Terms come into effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to use our Services. If you do not agree with any changes to the Services or the Terms, you may terminate your relationship with us in accordance with the **[**Termination**](#termination)** Section. It should be noted that changes to these Terms or the Viber App, will take effect immediately without prior written notice where such changes are exclusively to your benefit, where they are of a purely administrative nature and have no negative effect on you, or where they are directly imposed by law.

You understand that, just like a regular mobile phone service, anyone with knowledge of your phone number, that has Viber, may call you or send you messages through our Services and anyone you send a message to can use the content of your message as they desire.

* **Call Services; Viber Out (Subscription and Credit):** Viber offers you the opportunity to become a premium “Viber Out” user, which allows you to call non-Viber users (landlines or mobiles) around the world. Viber Out offers various subscription plans (each: a “**Viber Out Subscription**”). As a Viber user you are also able to purchase call credits (“**Viber Credit**”), either as a one-time payment or via recurring payments. For more information, please see the **[**Call Services – Viber Out Service Specific Terms**](#viber-out)** below.

* **Viber In:** You may receive incoming calls generated outside the Viber network, by your friends or other people calling your number, to be received through the Viber App. Viber In is provided for free and you may disable the ‘Viber In’ service at any time by changing the application settings.

* **Caller ID:** Viber Caller ID is a dedicated feature that allows Viber users to protect themselves from fraud and spam by setting up a caller identification for any incoming calls to their devices from phone numbers outside of their contact list.

* **Stickers and Lenses:** you can download or create digital stickers through the Viber App or use Viber Lenses. When you create digital stickers on our Service, they must abide by our [**Acceptable Use Policy**](https://www.viber.com/en/terms/viber-public-content-policy/).

* **Business Accounts (Micro and Small Businesses):** users who own micro or small business can increase their business engagement and create a business profile on the Viber App (“**Business Account**”), enabling the direct interaction with their customers, including by promoting their goods and services and using secure one-on-one messages. The Business Accounts and business services are governed by the [**Viber Business Accounts Terms and Conditions**](http://www.viber.com/en/terms/viber-business-terms-and-conditions/).

When users search for Business Accounts on Viber, our algorithm displays and orders results based on several main parameters, including (i) relevance to the user’s query (e.g., matching keywords in the Business Account name or description, business location, business category), (ii) general business interactions and responsiveness levels, (iii) compliance with Viber policies, and (iv) whether a Business Account has chosen to use the “Boost” feature (part of Business Account paid subscription), which can increase visibility over non-Boosted accounts. While Boost influences how prominently a Business Account appears, it does not guarantee a specific ranking or placement. Viber may update these parameters from time to time to improve user experience.

* **Business Solutions****:** For larger businesses, Viber offers various businesses-oriented solutions, which can be explored **[here](https://www.forbusiness.viber.com/en/)**.

* **Viber** **Payment Services:** Viber payment services allow you access to payment services such as having a wallet and sending and receiving money, which are provided via our third-party payment service provider. It is only available in certain countries. Viber Payment Services are governed by the applicable **[Viber Payment Services Terms and Conditions](https://www.viber.com/en/terms/viber-pay-terms-main-page/)** for the available countries

* **Communities and Channels:** Communities are group chats through which Viber users can share content and engage with one another in conversations (“**Community**”). The Channels feature enables you to engage and share content with your audience (“**Channel**”). Communities and Channels can include up to 1 billion Viber users. Any messages sent as well as content posted or shared within Communities or Channels, are subject to the [**Acceptable Use Policy**](https://www.viber.com/en/terms/viber-public-content-policy/) and the [**Viber Privacy Policy**](https://www.viber.com/en/terms/viber-privacy-policy/). The option to create a Community or a Channel is open to all Viber users. When you join a Community or a Channel, you will become a “**Member**” (of Community) or “**Subscriber**” (of Channel) and will be able to share such Community/Channel with other Viber users, if such option is permitted by Admins. Upon creating a Community or a Channel, you will automatically become a Superadmin of your Community/Channel. You can learn more about Superadmins’ privileges **[here](https://help.viber.com/hc/en-us/articles/9357329461917-Channels-knowledge-base-for-admins)** and **[here](https://help.viber.com/hc/en-us/articles/9340728226077-Communities-knowledge-base-for-admins)**. There can be multiple Superadmins and Admins, with a total limitation of 250 combined. Only the Superadmins and Admins of a Channel will be able to post content within a Channel. A Member/Subscriber can leave a Community or a Channel at any time by selecting the “**Leave and delete**” button.

The creation, operation and management of the Chatbots by Chatbot administrators is governed by the [**Viber Developer Agreement**](https://www.viber.com/en/terms/viber-developer-distribution-agreement/).  When you visit a Chatbot without subscribing to it, you will be a “**Guest**”. If you click the “**subscribe**” button anywhere within Viber or any button presented to you by the Chatbot, or start an interaction with the Chatbot, you will automatically become a “**S****ubscriber**” of the Chatbot and be able to send and receive messages from the Chatbot. At any time, you can unsubscribe from any Chatbot by clicking the “unsubscribe” button. Through the Chatbot the business may offer you to purchase goods and services, as further described under the [**Chatbot Purchases**](#chatbot-purchases) section below.

_The Viber Premium Services are subject to payments and fees._  
The Viber Premium Services are subject to fees and payments. The price stated for the Premium Services excludes all applicable taxes and currency exchange settlements, unless stated otherwise. If there is a charge associated with a one or more of the Premium Services, you agree to pay that charge. Viber may suspend or cancel the Premium Services or your access to your Viber Account if the payment is not received on time. In addition, using the Services, including the Premium Services, on a mobile application will use some of the data allowance available on the data package to which you have subscribed with your mobile network operator. Out-of-country usage may lead to significantly higher costs than regular usage, and you are solely responsible for keeping yourself informed and paying for possible roaming and other applicable charges levied by your mobile network operator. In addition, you are responsible for any charges, fees, changes to your mobile plan service or billing, alterations to your mobile device, or any other consequence that may arise out of your use of mobile billing. The terms and conditions of your mobile operator apply to your payment, in addition to our Terms. Mobile billing is not a bundled offer between our Services and your mobile plan service.

Premium Services are available subject to periodic subscriptions (“**Subscription Period**”) or otherwise a one-time payment. The subscription payments are recurring and automatically renewed for an additional Subscription Period. Viber reserves the right to revise the fees at any time in its sole discretion; if you do not agree with such revisions, you may cancel the subscription as detailed below.

When you make a purchase or pay for subscription through the Viber App or through our website, we use third party payment service providers(“**PSP**”), your payment or subscription, as applicable, is also subject to the terms of such third party (including with respect to payment terms, refunds, etc.), and you should read such applicable terms before you decide to complete the purchase. You agree to abide by any relevant terms of service or other legal agreement that governs your use of a given payment processing service or method. You can change your payment method and billing information provided for Viber Out services by logging into your Account at **[http://account.viber.com/](http://account.viber.com/)**. If you pay with currency other than USD or EUR, you agree that the amount you are eventually credited may vary, as a result of currency conversion policies of the PSPs, which you can find at the relevant website or location where you make the actual purchase. Any of your payments and purchases will apply through the designated Account from the time of purchase. Your order and receipt will be sent through an email acknowledgment through the email address you provided to us.

In-app payments for Premium Services which are processed through app stores (“**IAP**”) are subject to the applicable app store terms (Apple [Terms](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/), Google Play [Terms](https://play.google.com/intl/en_US/about/play-terms/), etc.), which you hereby consent to and agree to comply with.

Should you choose to cancel your subscription, your access to the paid Premium Services will continue through the end of your billing period, as applicable, and expire thereafter, and you may be downgraded to the free Services. To the extent permitted by applicable law, any fees paid for your purchase of a subscription plan are non-refundable, and we do not provide refunds for any partial subscriptions. For more information see the [**Refund**](#refunds) section below.

We may also offer, from time to time, special promotional offers, which may include different terms and conditions, including free trials. We reserve the right to change, cancel and/or restrict these promotional offers at our sole discretion and at any time. The specific terms for each promotion, including the terms of the free trial, will be disclosed prior to making the purchase(s) based on such promotion(s). Free trials may be limited in time and contain an automatic renewal unless you terminate the free trial up-to 24 hours prior to its expiration. We reserve the right to limit your ability to take advantage of multiple trials and to limit your use to one free trial.  

###### **9\. Refunds**

_Except as provided by law or as set forth herein, all purchases are final and non-refundable._

If you believe that Viber has charged you in error, you must contact Viber within 90 days of such charge. No refunds will be given for any charges after 90 days. If you purchase any digital content from Viber, any right you may have to withdraw from or cancel the purchase will terminate once the digital content has been delivered to you upon your request, and you will not be entitled to claim any refund, except where you believe Viber has charged you in error. Notwithstanding the above, if your purchase is an IAP, the refund policy and cancellation terms are subject to the applicable app store terms: for Apple App Store please see the refund terms **[here](https://support.apple.com/en-il/HT204084)**, and the cancellation terms **[here](https://support.apple.com/en-il/HT202039)**; for Google Play please see the refund and the cancellation terms **[here](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2479637?hl=en)**.

Viber reserves the right to refuse a refund request if it reasonably believes or suspects (i) that you are trying to unfairly exploit this refund policy, for example, by making repetitive refund requests in respect of the same product or feature; (ii) that you are in breach of these Terms or the Viber Privacy Policy; (iii) that you are using any of our products fraudulently or that your Account is being used by a third party fraudulently; or (iv) that you purchased your credit through a third party service and the terms of such third party do not allow such refund. This refund policy does not affect any of your statutory rights to pursue a claim.

When signing up as a subscriber of the Viber Out, Viber Plus, or any other applicable subscription plan, and regardless of which subscription plan you choose, you have a right to a **_fourteen (14) day cooling-off period_** in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations. The cooling-off period applies from the date of signing up to a subscription plan. If you begin to use the Service in any way, you agree that you forfeit the right to cancel your purchase of the Service as per the cooling-off rights mentioned in this section. If you want to cancel the Service during the cooling-off period, we recommend that you notify us by using the form available here: [**https://vb.me/ContactUs**](https://vb.me/ContactUs).

###### **17\. Governing law and Jurisdiction**

To the extent permitted by law, and with the exception of Section 19 below, the laws of England and Wales govern these Terms and any claims and disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or their subject matter. The courts in some countries may not apply the laws of England and Wales to some disputes related to these Terms. If you reside in one of those countries, the laws of your home country may apply to those disputes.

If you are residing in a country or territory within the European Region, you may resolve your claim within the competent court of Luxembourg that has the jurisdiction over claims that are brought by European Region residents.  

###### **18\. Arbitration, Class-Action Waiver**

_If you have a concern, please first contact us directly- we will try to resolve it. Please read the following paragraphs carefully because they provide that you and Viber agree to resolve all disputes through binding individual arbitration._ _This section sets forth the exclusive way you can resolve any dispute you may have with us. If you ever wish to seek any relief from us, you agree to do it only through arbitration, and you waive the ability to pursue a class action law suit._

**U.S. Residents:** To the fullest extent permissible by law, with the exception of disputes pertaining to Viber’s intellectual property rights and certain statutory claims that, pursuant to law, are not arbitral, any dispute of any kind between you and Viber arising under these Terms shall be resolved through binding arbitration pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures on an individual basis with no class relief. The arbitrator shall be a retired judge or justice of any New York State or federal court with substantial experience in the internet industry and shall follow New York substantive law in adjudicating the dispute, except that this Section shall be construed as a “written agreement to arbitrate” pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (“**FAA**”). You and we agree that we intend that this Section satisfies the “writing” requirement of the FAA. The hearing shall be conducted in the county that encompasses the billing address you have provided to Viber. For any claim in which you seek U.S. $10,000.00 or less, you shall have the choice as to whether the hearing is conducted in person, by telephone, or instead the arbitrator may decide the dispute without a hearing. For those claims that the arbitrator determines are not frivolous, Viber shall pay the costs and fees of JAMS and the arbitrator. Viber agrees that it will not seek reimbursement from you for its costs and fees incurred by it in the arbitration. AGREEMENT TO THESE TERMS CONSTITUTES AN AGREEMENT TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND A WAIVER OF THE ABILITY TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM IN A CLASS ACTION.

**Non-U.S. Residents****:** If any controversy, allegation, or claim (including any non-contractual claim) arises out of or relates to the Service or the Terms (“**Dispute**”) then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it. Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us. Your notice of Dispute to us must be sent to us at **[Viberforeigndispute@viber.com](mailto:Viberforeigndispute@viber.com)**. For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, Viber and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve Dispute, though nothing will require either you or Viber to resolve Dispute on terms which either you or Viber, in each of our sole discretion, are uncomfortable with.

If Dispute against Viber involves a paid Viber Service and we are unable to resolve it through dialogue (as described above), Viber will abide by Directive 2013/11/EU on Consumer Alternative Dispute Resolution. The European Commission Online Dispute Resolution (“**ODR**”) can be accessed at eu.europa.eu/odr. You can raise a complaint about our Services by contacting us on **[Viberforeigndispute@viber.com](mailto:Viberforeigndispute@viber.com).**   You may also be entitled to refer Disputes in relation to matters covered by the European Electronic Communications Code to an independent body for dispute resolution appointed in your country.

These Terms are the entire agreement between you and Viber relating to the matters contained herein and the Services.

Any misuse of the calling service may result in suspension or termination of your Account.

###### **Viber Out Subscription Specifications**

_Payment for Viber Out Subscriptions (e.g., recurring calling plans) are made on a recurring payment basis. This means that you agree that at the applicable recurring intervals your payment method will be charged, until you actively elect to terminate the Subscription._

Viber Out calling plans are provided on a subscription basis and are offered in different prices or payment terms according to the duration of the applicable subscription or the type of device you own, all as specified in our pricing page **[https://account.viber.com/en/](https://account.viber.com/en/).** We reserve the right to change our calling plans and Viber Out Subscriptions or stop offering them at any time. Reduction to the prices of our calling plans will not affect previously purchased and existing calling plans or Viber Out Subscriptions. Unused minutes or credit will not roll from one month to the next. Our Viber Out Subscriptions exclude special, premium, service, satellite, and non-geographic numbers.

You agree that you are authorizing recurring payments, and payments will be made to Viber by the method and at the recurring intervals you have agreed to, until the Viber Out Subscription is terminated by you or by Viber. You must cancel your Viber Out Subscription before the next billing date to stop being charged. We will provide you with instructions on how you may cancel the Viber Out Subscription. By authorizing recurring payments, you are authorizing Viber to store your payment instrument and process such payments, for more information please see [**Viber Stored Credential Agreement**](https://www.viber.com/en/terms/stored-credential-consent-agreement-consent-agreement/). Our Viber Out Subscriptions fees are charged in advance and are pre-paid once at the beginning of each subscription period.

We may change the terms or the price of the Viber Out Subscriptions at any time and if you have a recurring purchase, we will notify you by email, or other reasonable manner, at least 15 days before the price change. If you do not agree to the price change, you must cancel the Viber Out Subscription and stop using the Premium Services before the price change takes effect. If there is a fixed term and price for your Viber Out Subscription, that price will remain in force for the fixed term. Other changes to the calling plans and subscription, will take effect immediately without prior written notice where such changes are exclusively to your benefit, where they are of a purely administrative nature and have no negative effect on you, or where they are directly imposed by law. You may terminate from posting the changes.

We may offer distinctive features or services in each plan, add new features or change or cancel any existing features or functionalities at our sole discretion. We further reserve the right to change the subscription fees at our sole discretion. If you are a paid user at the time of such change, the new rate will be affected upon your next subscription period; otherwise, you may choose to cancel your subscription, in which case you will be refunded on a pro-rata basis.

Your Viber Out Subscription may start with a free trial period (“**Free Trial**”), when you sign up for a Free Trial, you acknowledge and agree that you will automatically be transferred to a recurring payment subscription plan at the end of the Free Trial, unless you terminate your Free Trial and cancel the Viber Out Subscription prior to the last day of the Free Trial, in which case you will not be charged additional fees. Note, you may only use only one Free Trial. We reserve the right to change, cancel and/or stop offering the Free Trial at any time.

Viber may terminate your Viber Out plan or offer you an alternative calling plan if we notice that your usage is in breach of the [**Acceptable Use Policy**](https://www.viber.com/en/terms/viber-public-content-policy/) or is abusing our systems. We reserve the right to change our calling rates and plans or Viber Out Subscription fees or even stop offering them at any time.

###### **Viber Credits Specifications**

_As a Viber user you may purchase Viber Credit either through recurring charges or one-time payments. Viber Credit balance is available through your Account._

The recurring charge feature will be automatically enabled when you buy Viber Credit through the Viber mobile application or Website and check the appropriate checkbox at the time of purchase. Your Viber Credit balance will be recharged with the same amount and by the same payment method you initially designated when you registered your Account every time your Account balance goes below the threshold set by Viber from time to time. By authorizing recurring payments, you are authorizing Viber to store your payment instrument and process such payments, for more information please see [**Viber Stored Credential Agreement**](https://www.viber.com/en/terms/stored-credential-consent-agreement-consent-agreement/). You can disable the recurring charge feature at any time by accessing your Account. Any charges mentioned in specific currencies are solely considered as examples, and do not take currency fluctuations or discrepancies into account.

The rates for calling landlines and mobile phones outside of the Viber community consist of a per-minute rate as set out on **[https://account.viber.com/en/rates-index](https://account.viber.com/en/rates-index)** and within the Viber App and your Account. After a 4-hour call duration, the call will be disconnected and require a re-dial. While we always try to keep our rates as low as possible, Viber may change the rates for calling phones at any time without notice to you by posting such change at **[http://account.viber.com/](http://account.viber.com/)**. The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published. Please check the latest rates before you make your call. If you do not accept the new rates, do not make your call.

The duration of a call is calculated per seconds and shall be based on one-minute increments. Fractions of minutes will be rounded up to the next minute. At the end of a call, fractional cent charges will be rounded up or down to the nearest whole cent. For example, a total call at a price of €0.034 will be rounded to €0.03. During the call, charges incurred will be deducted automatically from the Viber Credit balance in your Account.

If you do not use your Viber Credit for a period of six months (including Viber Credit that has been allocated to you by a Viber administrator), such credit will be frozen. You can reactivate the Viber Credit by accessing your Viber Out account and following the instructions therein. If your Account is deactivated, your Viber Credit will be lost. For this purpose, your Account may be deactivated in any of the following way: (i) you actively deactivate your Account; (ii) you remove Viber from your mobile device and do not reinstall it within three months; (iii) you do not log in to Viber for twelve consecutive months.

If you use third party services to purchase Viber Credit, such purchase is also subject to the terms of such third party (including with respect to payment terms, refunds, etc.).

For users in Japan, and users with Japanese area code (+81), that purchase Viber Credit, the Viber Credit will expire within 180 days of purchase, with no ability to reactivate.

###### **Emergency Calls**

To allow safe access to emergency services, the Viber mobile app initiates emergency calls through sending any 3 digit call, such as the European emergency number 112, to your mobile device’s native dial pad and your mobile network operator which in turn is set to direct the call free of charge and to the most appropriate Public Safety Answering Points. 

###### **Technical Support**

In case you experience any issue with the Viber Out service, please contact our support as provided under section 21 of the Terms and our team will check such report and will endeavor to remedy any such fault as reasonably feasible. For any information relating to technical details with respect to the calls transferred between mobile networks, please review your agreement with your mobile operator.
