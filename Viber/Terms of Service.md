*   **Viber Pay Terms of Service**
*   [**Viber Developer Agreement**](https://www.viber.com/en/terms/viber-developer-distribution-agreement/)

###### **2\. Our Services**

Currently we offer the following services, some of the services are free of charge (“**Free Services**”) and some premium services are subject to payments or a monthly subscription (“**Premium Services**”), all as detailed in the **[**Payment Sections**](#payments-and-charges)** below (collectively the “**Services**”):

*   **Viber App:** Desktop and mobile communication and messaging app, developed by Viber. You understand that, just like a regular mobile phone service, anyone with knowledge of your phone number, that has Viber, may call you or send you messages through our Services and anyone you send a message to can use the content of your message as they desire.

*   **Call Services; Viber Out (Subscription and Credit):** Viber offers you the opportunity to become a premium “Viber Out” user, which allows you to call non-Viber users (landlines or mobiles) around the world. Viber Out offers various subscription plans (each: a “**Subscription**”). As a Viber user you are also able to purchase call credits (“**Viber Credit**”), either as a one-time payment or via recurring payments. For more information, please see the **[**Call Services – Viber Out Service Specific Terms**](#viber-out)** below.

*   **Viber In:** You may receive incoming calls generated outside the Viber network, by your friends or other people calling your number, to be received through the Viber App. Viber In is provided for free and you may disable the ‘Viber In’ service at any time by changing the application settings.

*   **Stickers:** you can download or create digital stickers though the Viber App. When you create digital stickers on our Service, they must abide by our [**Acceptable use Policy**](https://www.viber.com/en/terms/viber-public-content-policy/). Some Stickers are available for free and some Stickers are available for purchase.

*   **Communities and Channels:** Communities are group chats through which Viber users can share content and engage with one another in conversations, and can include up to 1 billion Viber users (“**Community**”). The Channels feature enables you to engage and share content with your audience (“**Channel**”). Communities and Channels can include up to 1 billion Viber users. Any messages sent as well as content posted or shared within Communities or Channels, are subject to the [**Acceptable use Policy**](https://www.viber.com/en/terms/viber-public-content-policy/) and the [**Viber Privacy Policy**](https://www.viber.com/en/terms/viber-privacy-policy/). The option to create a Community or a Channel is open to all Viber users. When you join a Community or a Channel, you will become a “**Member**” of such Community/Channel and will be able to share such Community/Channel with other Viber users. Upon creating a Community or a Channel, you will automatically become a Superadmin of your Community/Channel (each, a “**Superadmin**”).  As a Superadmin you can add or remove other Superadmins, other Community/Channel Administrators (each, an “**Admin**”) or Members from the Community/Channel, control who can post in the Community/Channel, choose whether the Community/Channel can be shared by other Members or not, and delete messages by other Superadmins, Admins or Members (for Community). Superadmins can also revoke invite links and enlist other Viber users to the Community/Channel to become Superadmins or Admins. As a Community/Channel Admin you can remove Members from the Community/Channel, delete messages posted by Members and send an invite to other Viber users to become Members of the Community/Channel. There can be multiple Community/Channel Superadmins and Admins, with a total limitation of 250 combined. Only the Superadmins and Admins of a Channel will be able to post content within such Channel. A Member can leave a Community or a Channel at any time by selecting the “**Leave and delete**” button. Members of the Community can see the username and the photo of the other Members of the Community, and may send one-on-one messages to the Superadmins, Admins and other Members of the Community. Note that Members of a Channel may send one-on-one messages to the Superadmins or Admins of such Channel and vice versa but unlike Communities, Members of a Channel cannot see the information related to other Members of such Channel.

*   **Chatbots:** The Viber Chatbot feature enables you to subscribe to Viber’s and third parties’ Chatbot(s) and to send and receive one-on-one messages from the Chatbots (“**Chatbot**”). When you visit a Chatbot without subscribing to it, you will be a “**Guest**”. If you click the “**subscribe**” button anywhere within Viber or any button presented to you by the Chatbot, or start an interaction with the Chatbot, you will automatically become a “**subscriber**” of the Chatbot and be able to send and receive messages from the Chatbot. At any time, you can unsubscribe from any Bot by clicking the “unsubscribe” button. The Chatbot may also enable you to purchase Merchant’s Products, as further described under the **[**Chatbot Purchases**](#chatbot-purchases)**. The Chatbot administrators, are governed by the [**Viber Developer Agreement**](https://www.viber.com/en/terms/viber-developer-distribution-agreement/).

Viber may suspend or cancel the Premium Services or your access to your Viber Account if the payment is not received on time. In addition, using the Services, including the Premium Services, on a mobile application will use some of the data allowance available on the data package to which you have subscribed with your mobile network operator. Out-of-country usage may lead to significantly higher costs than regular usage, and you are solely responsible for keeping yourself informed and paying for possible roaming and other applicable charges levied by your mobile network operator. In addition, you are responsible for any charges, fees, changes to your mobile plan service or billing, alterations to your mobile device, or any other consequence that may arise out of your use of mobile billing. The terms and conditions of your mobile operator apply to your payment, in addition to our Terms. Mobile billing is not a bundled offer between our Services and your mobile plan service.

When you make a purchase within the Viber App or through our website, we use third party payment service providers (“**PSP**”), your purchase is also subject to the terms of such third party (including with respect to payment terms, refunds, etc.), and you should read such applicable terms before you decide to complete the purchase. You agree to abide by any relevant terms of service or other legal agreement that governs your use of a given payment processing service or method. You can change your payment method and billing information by logging into your Account at **[http://account.viber.com/](http://account.viber.com/)**. If you pay with currency other than USD or EUR, you agree that the amount you are eventually credited may vary, as a result of currency conversion policies of the PSPs, which you can find at the relevant website or location where you make the actual purchase. Any of your payments and purchases will apply through the designated Account from the time of purchase. Your order and receipt will be sent through an email acknowledgment through the email address you provided to us.

We may also offer, from time to time, special promotional offers, which may include different terms and conditions.

If you purchase any digital content from Viber, any right you may have to withdraw from or cancel the purchase will terminate once the digital content has been delivered to you upon your request, and you will not be entitled to claim any refund, except where you believe Viber has charged you in error.

Viber reserves the right to refuse a refund request if it reasonably believes or suspects (i) that you are trying to unfairly exploit this refund policy, for example, by making repetitive refund requests in respect of the same product or feature; (ii) that you are in breach of these Terms or the Viber Privacy Policy; (iii) that you are using any of our products fraudulently or that your Account is being used by a third party fraudulently; or (iv) that you purchased your credit through a third party service and the terms of such third party do not allow such refund.

Up-to-date evidence on call set up time and unsuccessful calls (through your list of calls made and attempted) is available through your User Account.

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless The Viber Group from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, costs or expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees, resulting from your breach of these Terms, including any of the foregoing provisions, representations or warranties, from your placement or transmission of any content onto Viber’s servers and/or from any and all use of your Account.

If you have a dispute with one or more users (including game developers and/or merchants), you release The Viber Group from claims, demands, liabilities, costs, or expenses and damages (actual and consequential of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes). In entering into this release, you expressly waive any protections (whether statutory or otherwise), to the extent permitted by applicable law, that would otherwise limit the coverage of this release to include only those claims which you may know or suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing to this release.  

###### **17\. Governing law and Jurisdiction**

To the extent permitted by law, and with the exception of Section 19 below, the laws of England and Wales govern these Terms and any claims and disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or their subject matter. The courts in some countries may not apply the laws of England and Wales to some disputes related to these Terms. If you reside in one of those countries, the laws of your home country may apply to those disputes.

If you are residing in a country or territory within the European Region, you may resolve your claim within the competent court of Luxembourg that has the jurisdiction over claims that are brought by European Region residents.  

###### **18\. Arbitration, Class-Action Waiver**

_If you have a concern, please first contact us directly- we will try to resolve it. Please read the following paragraphs carefully because they provide that you and Viber agree to resolve all disputes through binding individual arbitration.__This section sets forth the exclusive way you can resolve any dispute you may have with us. If you ever wish to seek any relief from us, you agree to do it only through arbitration, and you waive the ability to pursue a class action law suit._

**U.S. Residents:** To the fullest extent permissible by law, with the exception of disputes pertaining to Viber’s intellectual property rights and certain statutory claims that, pursuant to law, are not arbitral, any dispute of any kind between you and Viber arising under these Terms shall be resolved through binding arbitration pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures on an individual basis with no class relief. The arbitrator shall be a retired judge or justice of any New York State or federal court with substantial experience in the internet industry and shall follow New York substantive law in adjudicating the dispute, except that this Section shall be construed as a “written agreement to arbitrate” pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (“**FAA**”). You and we agree that we intend that this Section satisfies the “writing” requirement of the FAA. The hearing shall be conducted in the county that encompasses the billing address you have provided to Viber. For any claim in which you seek U.S. $10,000.00 or less, you shall have the choice as to whether the hearing is conducted in person, by telephone, or instead the arbitrator may decide the dispute without a hearing. For those claims that the arbitrator determines are not frivolous, Viber shall pay the costs and fees of JAMS and the arbitrator. Viber agrees that it will not seek reimbursement from you for its costs and fees incurred by it in the arbitration. AGREEMENT TO THESE TERMS CONSTITUTES AN AGREEMENT TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND A WAIVER OF THE ABILITY TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM IN A CLASS ACTION.

**Non-U.S. Residents****:** If any controversy, allegation, or claim (including any non-contractual claim) arises out of or relates to the Service or the Terms (“**Dispute**”) then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it. Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us. Your notice of Dispute to us must be sent to us at **[Viberforeigndispute@viber.com](mailto:Viberforeigndispute@viber.com)**. For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, Viber and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve Dispute, though nothing will require either you or Viber to resolve Dispute on terms which either you or Viber, in each of our sole discretion, are uncomfortable with.

If Dispute against Viber involves a paid Viber Service and we are unable to resolve it through dialogue (as described above), Viber will abide by Directive 2013/11/EU on Consumer Alternative Dispute Resolution. The European Commission Online Dispute Resolution (“**ODR**”) can be accessed at eu.europa.eu/odr. You can raise a complaint about our Services by contacting us on **[Viberforeigndispute@viber.com](mailto:Viberforeigndispute@viber.com).**   You may also be entitled to refer Disputes in relation to matters covered by the European Electronic Communications Code to an independent body for dispute resolution appointed in your country. A list of such bodies is available at: **[https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/main/?event=main.adr.show2](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/main/?event=main.adr.show2)**.  The list of the UK approved ADR schemes for Viber Out is available at: **[https://www.ofcom.org.uk/phones-telecoms-and-internet/advice-for-consumers/problems/adr-schemes](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/phones-telecoms-and-internet/advice-for-consumers/problems/adr-schemes)**.  

###### **19\. Miscellaneous**

These Terms are the entire agreement between you and Viber relating to the matters contained herein and the Services. Failure by Viber to enforce any rights or to take any action against you in the event of any breach hereunder shall not be deemed as a waiver of such rights or of subsequent actions in the event of future breaches.

#### **Call Services – Viber Out Service Specific Terms**

These Viber Out Service Specific Terms address the various Viber Out calling plans and services offered by Viber. The calling services and plans are governed by [**Fair Usage Principles**](https://www.viber.com/terms/viber-out-calls-fair-usage-principles/) and are intended for personal non-commercial use. Any misuse of the calling service may result in suspension or termination of your Subscription or Account.

###### **Viber Out Subscription Specifications**

_Payment for Subscriptions (e.g., recurring calling plans) are made on a recurring payment basis. This means that you agree that at the applicable recurring intervals your payment method will be charged, until you actively elect to terminate the Subscription._

Viber Out calling plans are provided on a Subscription basis and are offered in different prices or payment terms according to the duration of the applicable subscription or the type of device you own, all as specified in our pricing page **[https://account.viber.com/en/](https://account.viber.com/en/).** We reserve the right to change our calling plans and Subscriptions or stop offering them at any time. Reduction to the prices of our calling plans will not affect previously purchased and existing calling plans or Subscriptions. Unused minutes or credit will not roll from one month to the next. Our Subscriptions exclude special, premium, service, satellite, and non-geographic numbers.

You agree that you are authorizing recurring payments, and payments will be made to Viber by the method and at the recurring intervals you have agreed to, until the Subscription is terminated by you or by Viber. You must cancel your Subscription before the next billing date to stop being charged. We will provide you with instructions on how you may cancel the Subscription. By authorizing recurring payments, you are authorizing Viber to store your payment instrument and process such payments, for more information please see [**Viber Stored Credential Agreement**](https://www.viber.com/en/terms/stored-credential-consent-agreement-consent-agreement/). Our Subscriptions fees are charged in advance and are pre-paid once at the beginning of each Subscription period.

We may change the terms or the price of the Subscriptions at any time and if you have a recurring purchase, we will notify you by email, or other reasonable manner, at least 15 days before the price change. If you do not agree to the price change, you must cancel the Subscription and stop using the Premium Services before the price change takes effect. If there is a fixed term and price for your Subscription, that price will remain in force for the fixed term. Other changes to the calling plans and Subscription, will take effect immediately without prior written notice where such changes are exclusively to your benefit, where they are of a purely administrative nature and have no negative effect on you, or where they are directly imposed by law. You may terminate from posting the changes.

We may offer distinctive features or services in each Subscription, add new features or change or cancel any existing features or functionalities at our sole discretion. We further reserve the right to change the Subscription fees at our sole discretion. If you are a paid user at the time of such change, the new rate will be affected upon your next Subscription period; otherwise, you may choose to cancel your Subscription, in which case you will be refunded on a pro-rata basis.

Your Subscription may start with a free trial period (“**Free Trial**”), when you sign up for a Free Trial, you acknowledge and agree that you will automatically be transferred to a recuring payment Subscription plan at the end of the Free Trial, unless you terminate your Subscription prior to the last day of the Free Trial, in which case you will not be charged, and your Subscription will be cancelled. Note, you may only use only one Free Trial. We reserve the right to change, cancel and/or stop offering the Free Trial at any time.

Viber may terminate your Subscription or offer you an alternative calling plan if we notice that your usage is in breach of the [**Acceptable Use Policy**](https://www.viber.com/en/terms/viber-public-content-policy/) or is abusing our systems. We reserve the right to change our calling rates and plans or the Subscriptions’ fees or even stop offering them at any time.

###### **Viber Credits Specifications**

_As a Viber user you may purchase Viber Credit either through recurring charges or one-time payments. Viber Credit balance is available through your Account._

The recurring charge feature will be automatically enabled when you buy Viber Credit through the Viber mobile application or Website and check the appropriate checkbox at the time of purchase. Your Viber Credit balance will be recharged with the same amount and by the same payment method you initially designated when you registered your Account every time your Account balance goes below the threshold set by Viber from time to time. By authorizing recurring payments, you are authorizing Viber to store your payment instrument and process such payments, for more information please see [**Viber Stored Credential Agreement**](https://www.viber.com/en/terms/stored-credential-consent-agreement-consent-agreement/). You can disable the recurring charge feature at any time by accessing your Account. Any charges mentioned in specific currencies are solely considered as examples, and do not take currency fluctuations or discrepancies into account.

The rates for calling landlines and mobile phones outside of the Viber community consist of a per-minute rate as set out on **[https://account.viber.com/en/rates-index](https://account.viber.com/en/rates-index)** and within the Viber App and your Account. After a 4-hour call duration, the call will be disconnected and require a re-dial. While we always try to keep our rates as low as possible, Viber may change the rates for calling phones at any time without notice to you by posting such change at **[http://account.viber.com/](http://account.viber.com/)**. The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published. Please check the latest rates before you make your call. If you do not accept the new rates, do not make your call.

The duration of a call is calculated per seconds and shall be based on one-minute increments. Fractions of minutes will be rounded up to the next minute. At the end of a call, fractional cent charges will be rounded up or down to the nearest whole cent. For example, a total call at a price of €0.034 will be rounded to €0.03. During the call, charges incurred will be deducted automatically from the Viber Credit balance in your Account.

If you do not use your Viber Credit for a period of six months (including Viber Credit that has been allocated to you by a Viber administrator), such credit will be frozen. You can reactivate the Viber Credit by accessing your Viber Out account and following the instructions therein. If your Account is deactivated, your Viber Credit will be lost. For this purpose, your Account may be deactivated in any of the following way: (i) you actively deactivate your Account. (ii) you remove Viber from your mobile device and do not reinstall it within three months (iii) you do not log in to Viber for twelve consecutive months.

If you use third party services to purchase Viber Credit, such purchase is also subject to the terms of such third party (including with respect to payment terms, refunds, etc.).

For users in Japan, and users with Japanese area code (+81), that purchase Viber Credit, the Viber Credit will expire within 180 days of purchase, with no ability to reactivate.

###### **Emergency Calls**

To allow safe access to emergency services, the Viber mobile app initiates emergency calls through sending any 3 digit call, such as the European emergency number 112, to your mobile device’s native dial pad and your mobile network operator which in turn is set to direct the call free of charge and to the most appropriate Public Safety Answering Points. 

###### **Technical Support**

In case you experience any issue with the Viber Out service, please contact our support as provided under section 21 of the Terms and our team will check such report and will endeavor to remedy any such fault as reasonably feasible. For any information relating to technical details with respect to the calls transferred between mobile networks, please review your agreement with your mobile operator.
