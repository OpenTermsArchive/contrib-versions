######  **![](https://www.viber.com/app/uploads/Picture1.png)****The Data We Collect**

The operation and use of our Viber App and Services involves collection of personal data, where the types of such data depend on the type of Service and interaction with us. For example, when you sign up for Viber, you directly provide us personal data. We also automatically collect certain personal data from our users’ device. We explain which information we collect and how we collect it below.

The types of personal data collected through use of our Services, including App and website, are listed below. We note that, some types of personal data we collect are required for all Viber Services (for example, your phone number), some types may be required solely for certain Services or features you decide to use (for example, Viber payment services), and some are optional, and subject to your discretion (for example, your photo).

We do not read, listen or store your messages and/ or calls made privately:

We wish to clarify that we do not read or listen to the content of your messages and/or calls made privately via Viber and we do not store those messages (including any media files transferred therein) once they have been delivered to their destination (which on average takes less than one second). If for some reason the message was not delivered to its destination within up to 2 weeks, it will be deleted from our servers. We note that we allow you the option to back up your chat history data on your own external data backup service (like iCloud or Google Drive) – see **[**HERE**](#third-parties)** for more info on backup.

Data we collect or receive from other sources and inferred data:

*   **Social media data**:
    *   If you have signed in to the app through third party social media sites – your email address, birthday and gender – if such information has appeared on your social media profile – was collected.

*   **Your contact name**, as saved on other users’ devices if they chose to share their contacts with us.
*   **Viber may also process inferences about your account and device identifier**, such as:

    *   Inferences from third party data and ads-related interactions – we may receive inferred data, linked to your device identifier (mainly, a unique device identifier generated by cookies or other tracking technologies used on our website and Services) from our trusted third-party advertisers and service providers. Such inferred data we receive may include inferences about your interests and characteristics, generated by such third parties from other websites and services you have visited (for example whether you are interested in fintech, cars etc., which income group you might pertain to, as well as the locations you tend to visit, based on your GPS location). In addition, inferences can be generated from data on how you interact with ads displayed on our App after clicking on them and data about your activity and preferences derived from the clicks on our own ads (and the subsequent installs of our App) associated with your device identifier, delivered on third party’s advertising platforms by our trusted third parties. For more information, please see our [**Viber Ads, Cookies & Tracking Technologies Policy.**](https://www.viber.com/en/terms/cookies-and-tracking/)

User Submitted Content:

If you choose to participate in Viber’s activities (e.g., contests), or as part of your participation in communities/channels/bots’ activities available on Viber, you may voluntarily publish, submit or post content such as videos, images, graphics, text, videos, etc. which may include personal data (e.g., an image of a person).

Data we collect from your communications with us, including support, customer services and other inquiries:

If you choose to contact us through any means of communications we make available, you may provide us with certain information such as your contact details (e.g., name, email, phone number, mobile carrier, country – mainly where you are not a user of our Services) and other information you provide (mainly, related to the issue you wish us to address or resolve, including without limitation, information related to disputed transactions). We will further store our contact history and correspondence with you.

Non-User Data:

**Mobile phone number and contact name, as saved on a Viber user’s phone address book**:  We may process your mobile phone number even if you are not a Viber user, in the event that your phone number was included in our existing user’s address book that has been provided to us (and subject to such user providing us with approval to access the device address book). We will also save the name it was saved under by our user. We do it to show our user who in their contacts is already using our Services and who is not, to allow users find and communicate with their contacts who are users or who are not users in a more efficient way, and solely for as long as a relevant Viber user’s account exists on Viber. In the event you will become an active user, the existing users whose phone book included your number, will be notified that you have joined the Service and you will be automatically added to their contact list within the Viber App.

**If you are not a Viber user and would like to exclude your phone number, please contact us at [https://vb.me/ContactUs](https://vb.me/ContactUs)**

**Caller ID**: Additionally, if you are not a Viber user, your phone number and contact name (if provided to us by a user through sharing their contacts or otherwise) will be added to our Caller ID database and used as part of Viber Caller ID feature (for more info see **[here](https://www.viber.com/en/blog/2023-04-05/free-caller-id-is-now-on-viber/)**), which allows to indicate your name to Caller ID users when you are on a call with them outside Viber. Such process enables Viber to improve Caller ID services with a purpose to reduce spam, fraud and harassment for our users.

######  ![](https://www.viber.com/app/uploads/Picture2.png) How We Use Your Data

At Viber, we use your personal data to provide you with the best possible Service. This includes administering your account, customizing and improving the Service we offer, processing payments, serving ads and marketing campaigns, providing you with support and for compliance and safety reasons. We explain below the purposes for which we collect and use your personal data, as well as the types of data we use for each purpose.

You can find here information regarding the purposes for which we collect and use your personal data.

If you use our Services from the EEA or the UK, we must have a lawful basis to process your personal data. Please review our [**EU Region Privacy Notice**](https://www.viber.com/en/terms/gdpr-privacy-rights/) for detailed information.

**Authentication and Account Administration:**

Viber uses different types of your personal data to create and administrate your Viber account in order to enable you to register, log in, activate and use the Services. This includes, for example:

*   To authenticate and verify your account, as well as to make sure you do not already have a Viber account;
*   To synchronize your contact list on the App (meaning, in order to show you your contacts on the Viber interface so you contact them through Viber or hide them on your dating profile if you choose so);
*   To create your profile, customize your Viber account according to the information you have provided (e.g. name or photo), and display such information as part of your profile when you use Viber Services.
*   Creating your dating profile, including verification of your eligibility to use the dating services. As part of such process you might be required to provide a copy of your ID or similar documentation. We will not retain such copies for a period longer than required for the verification process.
*   If you choose to voluntarily verify your dating profile, we will process your Biometric Data. This involves comparing a selfie you provide with your profile photos using facial recognition technology, to confirm that the person in the profile is you. This helps prevent impersonation and fake profiles by detecting your genuine presence on the other end of the device. We process the selfie and the facial data to generate a verification score, a numeric result indicating how closely the images match. After verification, we only keep this verification result for possible future review (e.g. if your profile photo is edited or removed). We do not store or reuse the biometric templates or facial geometry data. This information is stored only as long as your dating profile is active. If you change or remove the profile photo that was used during verification, your verified status will no longer apply, and you’ll be asked to complete the verification process again to keep your dating profile marked as verified.

The types of data we will use for such purpose will mainly include (as detailed in the “**[**Data We Collect**](#data-we-collect)**” section above):

*   Data provided or collected through registration & under your Viber account, such as Identifiers, dating profile data, your photo and phone address book;

######  **![](https://www.viber.com/app/uploads/Picture6.png) Data Retention**

As we have explained above, we process personal data for various purposes. Accordingly, we only keep personal data as long as required to fulfill the purpose for which the data was collected, or, in some instance, where we have other necessities to retain the personal data, for example, where required by law. We explain below the criteria used by us to determine the retention of your personal data (meaning, for how long we store it and when we delete it, aligned with the type of data and purpose of collection).

The criteria used by us to determine Viber’s retention periods are as follows:

*   The type of personal data and purpose of collection – unless otherwise specified, we retain data as long as it is necessary and relevant for us to achieve the purposes for which the personal data was collected. For example:
    *   Personal data required to be retained in order to maintain your Viber account and to enable you the use of Viber Services – these types of data, including your mobile number, and phone address book, will be retained for as long as you maintain your Viber account.
    *   Personal data you have voluntarily provided during registration or through your account (including dating profile or business account data) – these types of data, including your photo, date of birth, email address, will be retained for as long as you maintain your account.
    *   The details of your communication with our customer support team will be stored for 10 years.
    *   Call Detail Records of your free Viber calls and messaging activity, as well as records of your in-app activities (jointly, CDRs) are kept as a raw data for 24 months from creation. CDRs may include, for example, your phone number and device identifiers (i.e., IP address, unique device identifiers).
    *   We delete any message once delivered, or after 14 days if delivery attempts throughout this period was not successful.

If you decide to delete your Viber account, the CDRs and communications with our customer support will be retained as detailed above, and we will further retain records of financial information (with respect to Viber payment services this means KYC data, transaction and wallet related information or your hashed pin code), Viber Out usage including CDRs, purchasing subscriptions,), for the periods required under applicable laws, or as needed in accordance with our fraud monitoring program or to identify a returning user (for Viber payment services).

All other types of data related to your Viber account will be deleted, unless we are required to further retain the data, subject to the criteria detailed below. We may keep activity data on a non-identifiable basis to improve our Services. Your posts on channels and communities may remain available if you do not delete them. Please note that deletion of the App (i.e., uninstall the App from your device) will not immediately delete your account, but if you do not reinstall it within subsequent two weeks your account may be deactivated; provided however if you have Viber Credit under your Viber Out account, other time periods will apply as set forth under “Viber Credits Specifications” clause of **[Viber Out Service Specific Terms](https://www.viber.com/en/terms/viber-terms-use/)**. Note that your account may also be deactivated if you do not log into Viber for twelve consecutive months.

Please see information and instruction regarding your account deletion [**HERE**](https://help.viber.com/hc/en-us/articles/9174583112861-Deactivate-or-Uninstall-Viber-on-Your-Phone)**.**

*   **Compliance with our legal obligations** – we are required to retain certain types of data in order to comply with our obligations under applicable laws. For example, we need to retain transactions information to comply with tax legislation. In addition, we may retain certain types of personal data in the event we are required to do so subject to a binding legal request or a court order. Further, subject to EU Directive 2002/58/EC we are required to retain certain personal data (such as phone number) to convey messages and calls.
*   **Dispute, claims and legal proceedings** – if you have a dispute with us, we may retain certain types of personal data as necessary and applicable to your claims, including any legal proceedings between us, until such dispute was resolved, and following, if we find it necessary, in accordance with applicable statutory limitation periods. In addition**,** in the event you request to exercise your rights, we will maintain the applicable correspondence for as long as needed to demonstrate compliance, and usually in accordance with applicable statutory limitation periods.
*   **Retention for Non-User Data** – if you are not a Viber user, and we process your data to enable Viber users to communicate with you via Viber Services we will retain such data as long as it is relevant to Viber users, or until you have requested us to stop processing your phone number. You can request to exclude your phone number and opt out **[here](https://help.viber.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=11857662434717)**.

Furthermore, if one of our users used our Viber Out Services in order to communicate with you (i.e., call you through Viber), we will retain a log of such call (Call Detail Records – CDR – as detailed above), which will include your phone number, for 24 months from creation. In relation to Viber payment services we store non-user data as long as it is relevant to a Viber payment services user (i.e. you are the sender or a recipient in a transaction with them or as part of a promotion). Further, this information may be stored as part of our fraud prevention program or in response to specific customer queries.

######  **![](https://www.viber.com/app/uploads/legal_icon.png) Third-Party Websites, Apps, Services and Back-Ups**

Our App may contain links to other third-party websites or you may access Apps from a third-party website. We may also allow certain functionalities through third-party services. We are not responsible for the data collection by such third parties, and their privacy practices and polices shall govern your personal data processed by them.

**Third parties’ websites, apps and services:**

If you access our Services and App from any third-party website, service or other digital source, or access any third-party site or service from our Services and App, note that, your use and the personal data collected by such third parties or provided by you in connection therewith will be subject to such third party’s practices and we do not monitor, nor are responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties.

We use the Google Maps API for some functions of the App, therefore the Google privacy policy **[http://www.google.com/privacy.html](http://www.google.com/privacy.html)** is incorporated herein.

**Back-ups:**

If you voluntarily choose to back up your Viber conversations, such back-ups are made by independent third parties and kept on your device’s service according to operating system’s (Google/ iOS) terms and policies and are no longer protected by Viber’s end-to-end encryption nor Viber has any control over it. This is also true for using Viber Desktop – where your conversations are kept on your personal computer under your security definitions.

**TrueDepth APIs:**

Starting the end of June 2021 we added a new face lens feature that uses camera capabilities in order to add graphic elements on the user’s face. Some lenses can make use of TrueDepth API. TrueDepth API is only active when those lenses are running. It is a very specific feature and none of the Viber lenses will be using it at the moment. Types of lenses that might use it are virtual try-on, which we don’t have. Viber does not collect any data from these sensors or ever store it anywhere. The data never leaves the user’s device (so cannot be, and is not, shared by Viber with third parties) and is only used for lens operation.
