====================

_\[Last Updated: March 22, 2022  – [What changed?](https://www.viber.com/en/blog/2022-03-20/viber-privacy-policy-updates/)\]_

As part of our mission to spread good vibes, we want you to be able to share the things that matter to you most with your friends, family and anyone else around you. It’s important to us that you feel comfortable and trust us with your data when using the Viber Services (as detailed under [**Viber’s Terms of Service**](https://www.viber.com/en/terms/viber-terms-use/)). Please take a few minutes to read this Privacy Policy, so that you understand what data we collect, what we do with it and why, how we protect it and what are your rights in relation to this data.

In general, we collect data that allows us to provide you with an optimal experience while using our Services. This includes, for example, some basic benefits like allowing other users to see the name and picture you choose to show and the more advanced ones, like processing your registration and financial data to allow you to purchase our paid solutions, if you choose to use them. It also helps us to keep our Services clear of fraud and spam, and it allows us to get a unique understanding of what additional services may be useful to you, in addition to other purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.

Starting with Viber 6.0, Viber’s core features are secured with end-to-end encryption: Viber one-on-one calls, one-on-one messages, group messages, private media sharing and linked devices. This means that the encryption keys are stored only on your devices and no one, not even Viber itself, has access to them. To learn more about Viber Encryption, follow this link: [**http://www.viber.com/en/security**](http://www.viber.com/en/security)**.**

We will also save the name it was saved under by our user. We do it to show our user who in their contacts is already using our Services and who is not, to allow users find and communicate with their contacts who are users or who are not users in a more efficient way, and solely for as long as a relevant Viber user’s account exists on Viber. In the event you will become an active user, the existing users whose phone book included your number, will be notified that you have joined the Service and you will be automatically added to their App’s contact list.

You can always delete your posts on those public spaces, but Viber cannot control and is not responsible for what other users do with this information (e.g., store on their devices, publish on Viber or outside of it etc.), thus, we recommend you do not disclose your personal data through the content of your posts.

We take measures to ensure the transfer of such data will provide sufficient safeguards. These measures include compliance with Binding Corporate Rules of the Rakuten Group, as well as contractual commitments of our partners and service providers.  We further explain below why we transfer personal data, the measures we take to ensure your personal data will be secure upon transfer, and your rights in this regard.

######  **![](https://www.viber.com/app/uploads/Picture6.png) Data Retention**

As we have explained above, we process personal data for various purposes. Accordingly, we only keep personal data as long as required to fulfill the purpose for which the data was collected, or, in some instance, where we have other necessities to retain the personal data, for example, where required by law. We explain below the criteria used by us to determine the retention of your personal data (meaning, for how long we store it and when we delete it, aligned with the type of data and purpose of collection).

The criteria used by us to determine Viber’s retention periods are as follows:

*   **The type of personal data and purpose of collection –** unless otherwise specified, we retain data as long as it is necessary and relevant for us to achieve the purposes for which the personal data was collected. For example:
*   Personal data required to be retained in order to maintain your Viber account and to enable you the use of Viber Services – these types of data, including your mobile number, and phone address book, will be retained for as long as you maintain your Viber account.
*   Personal data you have voluntarily provided during registration or through your account – these types of data, including your photo, date of birth, email address and interests, will be retained for as long as you maintain your Viber account.
*   The details of your communication with our customer support team will be stored for 10 years.
*   Call Detail Records (CDRs) of your calls and messaging activity are kept as a raw data for 24 months from creation. CDRs may include, for example, your phone number and device identifiers (i.e., IP address, unique device identifier).
*   We delete any message once delivered, or after 14 days if delivery attempts throughout this period was not successful.

If you decide to delete your Viber account, the CDRs and communications with our customer support will be retained as detailed above, and we will further retain records of purchases you have made (using Viber Pay, purchasing subscriptions, etc.), for the periods required under applicable laws, or as needed in accordance with our fraud monitoring program.

All other types of data related to your Viber account will be deleted, unless we are required to further retain the data, subject to the criteria detailed below. We may keep activity data on a non-identifiable basis to improve our Services. Your posts on channels and communities may remain available if you do not delete them. Please note that deletion of the App (i.e., uninstall the App from your device) will not delete your account. Please see information and instruction regarding your account deletion [**HERE**](https://help.viber.com/en/article/deactivate-or-uninstall-viber-on-your-phone)**.**

*   **Compliance with our legal obligations –** we are required to retain certain types of data in order to comply with our obligations under applicable laws. For example, we need to retain transactions information to comply with tax legislation. In addition, we may retain certain types of personal data in the event we are required to do so subject to a binding legal request or a court order. Further, subject to EU Directive 2002/58/EC we are required to retain certain personal data (such as phone number) to convey messages and calls.
*   **Dispute, claims and legal proceedings** – if you have a dispute with us, we may retain certain types of personal data as necessary and applicable to your claims, including any legal proceedings between us, until such dispute was resolved, and following, if we find it necessary, in accordance with applicable statutory limitation periods. In addition**,** in the event you request to exercise your rights, we will maintain the applicable correspondence for as long as needed to demonstrate compliance, and usually in accordance with applicable statutory limitation periods.
*   **Retention for Non users’ data –** If you are not a Viber user, and we process your data to enable Viber users to communicate with you via Viber Services we will retain such data as long as it is relevant to Viber users, or until you have requested us to stop processing your phone number. You can request to exclude your phone number (by contacting us at: [**https://help.viber.com/en/contact**](https://help.viber.com/en/contact)).

At Viber, we take information security seriously and have strict security measures in place to ensure that your account and your personal data are safe. Here you can find information regarding the security measures we have in place.

We implement technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk to the personal data we process. These measures are aimed at ensuring the ongoing integrity and confidentiality of personal data. We evaluate these measures on a regular basis to ensure the security of the processing. To learn more about our security measures, follow this link: [**http://www.viber.com/en/security**](http://www.viber.com/en/security)**.**

######  **![](https://www.viber.com/app/uploads/legal_icon.png) Third-Party Websites, Apps and Back-Ups**

Our App may contain links to other third-party websites or you may access Apps from a third-party website. We are not responsible for the data collection by such third parties, and their privacy practices and polices shall govern your personal data processed by them.

**Third parties’ websites and apps:**

If you access or Services and App from any third-party website or other digital source, or access any third-party site from our Services and App, note that, your use and the personal data collected will be subject to such third party’s practices and we do not monitor, nor responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties.

**Back-ups:**

If you voluntarily choose to back up your Viber conversations, such back-ups are made by independent third parties and kept on your device’s service according to operating system’s (Google/ iOS) terms and policies and are no longer protected by Viber’s end-to-end encryption nor Viber has any control over it. This is also true for using Viber Desktop – where your conversations are kept on your personal computer under your security definitions.

**TrueDepth APIs:**

Starting the end of June 2021 we added a new face lens feature that uses camera capabilities in order to add graphic elements on the user’s face. Some lenses can make use of TrueDepth API. TrueDepth API is only active when those lenses are running. It is a very specific feature and none of the Viber lenses will be using it at the moment. Types of lenses that might use it are virtual try-on, which we don’t have. Viber does not collect any data from these sensors or ever store it anywhere. The data never leaves the user’s device (so cannot be, and is not, shared by Viber with third parties) and is only used for lens operation.
