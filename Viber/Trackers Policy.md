_\[Last Updated: June 1, 2023\]_

Viber Media S.à r.l., its subsidiaries and affiliated companies (collectively, “**Viber**”, “**we**”, “**our**”, or “**us**”) maintain our websites available at: [**www.viber.com**](http://www.viber.com/) and [**www.forbusiness.viber.com**](http://www.forbusiness.viber.com/), and our mobile applications, services and tools (collectively, the “**Services**”, and as further detailed under **[Viber’s Terms of Service](https://www.viber.com/en/terms/viber-terms-use/)**).

We, along with our advertising partners and vendors, use a variety of tracking technologies, including cookies, for various purpose, including to learn more about how people use the Services (e.g., through internal statistics, etc.) in order to enhance and improve our Services, provide our users with personalized content including ads, for security purposes, etc.

###### **Cookies & Other Tracking Technologies: What Are They & Categories of Cookies** 

We, and our third-party partners, use cookies on our websites, as well as other tracking technologies on our Services, including, for example, technologies known as HTTP cookies, HTML5, Flash local storage, embedded scripts, and Unique Identifiers (as defined below), used for tracking on our mobile application (collectively, shall be referred to herein for convenience as “Cookies”, unless otherwise stated). You can find explanation regarding each such technology under the **[Additional Information – Types of Tracking Technologies](#additional-information)** section below, and with respect to the use of Unique Identifiers under the **[**Use of Cookies & Tracking Technologies for Advertising and Marketing Purposes**](#use-of-cookies)** section below.

A cookie is a small data file that is sent to your device’s (computer, tablet or mobile phone) web browser when you visit a website, interact with advertisements or other features, etc., and is stored on your device hard drive so that a website can recognize your device once you visit the website again. Cookies and other tracking technologies usually include an identification number that is unique to the device or the browser you are using (meaning, a unique series of numbers and letters assigned to your device or browser, and including an identifier known as “advertising identifier”) (“**Unique Identifier**“). We use “first” and “third-party” Cookies.  First party cookies are used and controlled by Viber to provide our Services, operate, protect and improve the Services. Third-party cookies are controlled by third parties (e.g., our service providers and business partners), mostly for the purpose of advertising and analytics. Cookies can either be persistent (i.e., they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary – known as “session” (i.e., they last only until you close your browser). We use both session and persistent Cookies.

Cookies are used by us for a variety of purposes, including in order to enhance your online experience, for example, by remembering your log-in status and viewing preferences from a previous use of our websites, for when you later return to it; or to help us understand how users use the Services and their preferences, such as which pages or content are most popular, so that we can better provide our content and Services as well as for our third-party partners to provide personalized advertisements.

In general, we use the following categories of Cookies as part of our Services:

* **Strictly Necessary Cookies:**

These Cookies are necessary in order to provide Services and features you have specifically requested (meaning, set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms), as well as necessary for our website to function and for fraud prevention and security purposes. That is why these Cookies cannot be switched off in our systems. If you set your browser to refuse these Cookies, some parts of the Services may not then work.

* **Analytics and Performance Cookies:**

These Cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our Services. They help us understand which pages are the most and least popular and learn how visitors move around the Services. If you do not allow these Cookies we will not know when you have visited our Services and will not be able to monitor its performance.

* **Functionality Cookies:** 

These Cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and display customized videos and images. They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our webpages. We may also use Cookies to tell us, for example, whether you have visited the Services before or if you are a new visitor. If you do not allow these Cookies, then some or all of these services may not function properly.

* **Targeting Cookies:**

These Cookies may be set through our Services by us or by our advertising partners. They may be used to deliver content, including ads, relevant to your interests on our Services. They may also be used by such partners to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. These Cookies are based on your Unique Identifier. If you do not allow these Cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.

Note that, at any time you are able to change your Cookies settings and the tracking operation to control Cookies placement by limiting use of Cookies on your device, opt out or delete certain Cookies already stored on your device – all as detailed under the “[**Your Cookie Choices & How to Opt-Out**](#your-cookie-choices)” section below. Where required under applicable laws, we will obtain your consent for data collection through use of Cookies.

  

###### **Use of Cookies & Tracking Technologies for Advertising and Marketing Purposes**   

To enable the limited advertisements on our Service, we may generate and share, through our use of Cookies and tracking technologies, a Unique Identifier with our third party advertising partners and advertising service providers (listed [**HERE**](https://www.viber.com/app/uploads/Advertising-Partners.June2023.pdf)), along with certain data collected from your device or use of our Services, and for example your age range, inferred gender, country, city (i.e., general location extracted from your IP address), or GPS location data (if you allowed us in your settings). This includes partners managing our advertising placements, as well as partners and service providers supporting targeting, measurements, and optimizations for us including for Viber’s own marketing campaigns, and also advertisers themselves and their agencies or third parties managing their advertising demands. For more details on the use of third-party Cookies and tracking technologies on our Services see **[**Cookies & Tracking Technologies Used on Viber Services**](#cookies-used-on-viber).**

We may also receive data associated with your Unique Identifier from trusted third parties, which may be used to show you more relevant ads and content on our Services or for better advertising analytics, based on information collected by such third parties on other websites and services. This means that the Unique Identifier of your device could be linked to certain characteristics and interests as part of our aggregated segmentation groups for advertising purposes.

Additionally, we might use Cookies to receive data derived from the clicks on our own ads (and the subsequent installs of our app) delivered on third party services, for better ad measurements, to learn more about the subsequent user activity and preferences on our Services, help find similar users, and assess the performance of our content. The advertising networks and/or content providers that deliver ads on our Services or deliver our ads on third party sites may use cookies, pixels or other tracking technology to uniquely distinguish your web browser or device and keep track of information relating to serving ads on your web browser, or mobile app such as the type of ads shown and the pages on which the ads appear and also certain activities performed by you after clicking on the ads.

Some of these third parties may combine information they collect from our Services with other information they have independently collected relating to your web browser’s activities across their network of websites. These third parties collect and use this information under their own privacy policies, and are responsible for their practices concerning personal data. You can directly exercise your rights with them.

We also use Unique Identifiers for our own marketing and advertising campaigns, to make them more relevant and meaningful to you, and to track the efficiency and analyze these campaigns, both on our Services and on other websites or mobile apps.

For users in the EEA, and the UK, we attest to industry standard related to the use of Cookies for advertising purposes. We have implemented consent mechanism in order to obtain your consent for the use of Cookies, where required under applicable law, and we follow the applicable frameworks and procedures to ensure that other third parties in the digital advertising chain will respect your preferences. You can access and manage these consents at any time through the Viber personal information settings, under manage ad preferences and these changes will apply going forward.

###### **Your Cookie Choices & How to Opt-Out** 

You have the choice whether to accept the use of Cookies or not, except for those that are Strictly Necessary to operate the service. Subject to applicable laws, we will obtain your consent prior to our use of Cookies.

Most browsers -accept HTTP cookies by default.  The “help” feature of the menu bar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to receive notification of new cookies and how to disable existing cookies.

Controlling the HTML5 local storage on your browser depends on which browser you use.  For more information regarding your specific browser, please consult the browser’s website (often in the Help section). Please note, however, that without HTTP cookies and HTML5 local storage, you may not be able to take full advantage of all the features of our Services and some parts of the Services may not function properly.

Please note that, in the event you disable certain Cookies and tracking technologies (e.g., functional cookies, Unique Identifier), you may not be able to take full advantage of all the features of our Services and some parts of the Services may not function properly. In addition, note that, rejecting Cookies and tracking technologies does not mean that you will no longer see ads when you visit our Services. Viber is not responsible for the effectiveness of any opt-out options provided by third parties.

For more information about HTTP cookies and how to disable them, you can consult the information available at:

[**http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/**](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) and **[www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/)**.

You may opt-out of the data collection, sharing process and advertising services related to Cookies, as follows:

* **Cookies Setting Tool:** 

You can opt-out from web cookies (except for those that are Strictly Necessary) through the ‘Cookies Settings’ featured within the cookie banner on our websites.  Click on the different category headings to find out more and change our default settings. The preferences you chose will be stored in a separate cookie that is stored uniquely on your device. Please note that your preference settings will not be known if you visit our website from another device, use a different browser, or reset your current browser, and that you need to specify your preference settings again in such cases.

* **Browser Settings:**

You may set your browser to block Cookies, or to indicate when a Cookie is being set, by adjusting the privacy and security settings of your web browser. Please refer to the support page of the browser you are using. In this regard, following are some links, which you may find useful:

|     |     |

* **Mobile Devices:** 

To opt out of interest-based ads on mobile devices, please follow these instructions for your mobile device:

* * Android/iOS Device: On Android open the Google Settings app on your device and select “ads” to control the settings. On iOS devices with iOS 6 and above use Apple’s advertising identifier. To learn more about limiting ad tracking using this identifier, visit the settings menu on your device or the following links:
        * iOS – **[https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074)**
        * Android – **[https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en)** 

* * Apple’s App Tracking Transparency Prompt: With iOS 14.5, Apple introduced the AppTracking Transparency (ATT) framework, which requires any app to ask its users for their permission to access their device’s advertising identifier and use the data about them received from the apps and websites owned by other companies, for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes. Viber will allow you to make your own choice by reacting to the ATT Prompt, which will be displayed prior to connecting identifiable data collected on Viber with identifiable data from other companies’ apps and websites, for advertising purposes. Furthermore, you will always have an option to opt out of such tracking by visiting your iOS device’s settings menu. Once the setting is changed, we will make this change to take effect in our systems as soon as possible. More information on the AppTracking Transparency (ATT) framework is available  **[HERE](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/).**
    * Analytics: You can also disable analytics for mobile apps from the settings screen on your mobile device.
    * Specific Region Control: If you are a user in the EEA, or the UK, you can also control the “allow interest-based ads” setting on your Viber privacy settings (for more information see our **[EU Region Privacy Notice](https://www.viber.com/en/terms/gdpr-privacy-rights/)**). If you are a California user, you can switch on the “Do not sell or share my personal information” toggle (for more info see **[CCPA Notice](https://www.viber.com/en/terms/ccpa-privacy-rights/)**) – in which case we will not share your Unique Identifier with our third-party advertisers.
    * Location: To opt-out of exact location tracking when using our App, you can use the settings of your device, or the Viber privacy settings.

* **Opt-Out Provided by Third Parties:** 

The table above, detailing out third party partners, further includes reference to their applicable webpage related to opt- out controls made available by such third parties.

You may opt-out of additional third-party advertising networks using the tools offered by the Network Advertising Initiative’s Website, at:  **[http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt\_out.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp)** and following the directions there.

  

###### **Additional Information – Types of Tracking Technologies and Unique Identifiers**   

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Cookies/HTML5 Local Storage** | A cookie (sometimes referred to as local storage object or LSO) is a data file placed on a device.  Cookies can be created through a variety of web-related protocols and technologies, such as HTTP (sometimes referred to as “browser cookies”), and HTML5. |     |
| **Embedded Script** | An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Services, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter. |     |
| **Unique Identifier** | A unique identifier is a serial number, or string of characters, specific to a user’s mobile device.  It is stored on the mobile device and can be retrieved by any app that is downloaded and installed.
