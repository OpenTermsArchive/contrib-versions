If you have any concerns about our processing, please refer to the details of your rights in Section 6 below.

### 2.3 Cross-device tracking

Your browsing activity may be tracked across different websites and different devices or apps. For example, we may attempt to match your browsing activity on your mobile device with your browsing activity on your laptop to efficiently serve content to you if you're a logged-in user or, in the case of non-logged-in users, to increase the accuracy of site usage analytics. To do this, our technology service providers may share data, such as your browsing patterns and device identifiers, and will match the information of the browser and devices that appear to be used by the same person.

### 2.4 Business-to-business accounts

You may be receiving access to our O'Reilly learning platform service pursuant to a business-to-business ("B2B") contract in place between us and your employer. Some of our B2B customers are subject to laws and regulations such as GDPR which require them to execute a data processing addendum or other kinds of stipulations regarding privacy and personal data protection with us. To the extent that your employer has executed a data processing addendum with O'Reilly, the following terms apply to our processing of your personal information in relation to a B2B account:

* **We act as data processors** for the personal information that we receive from your employer. This is the personal information that we require in order to create a user account for you under our B2B contract with your employer. As data processors, we only process this personal information in accordance with the instructions provided to us by your employer, who, as data controller, is solely responsible for determining the purposes for which we may process your personal information.
* **We act as data controllers** for any personal information we collect in relation to your usage of the O'Reilly learning platform ("B2B Usage Data"), such as the content you have accessed, as well as for any additional personal information you choose to share with us. Our policies in relation to our collection and processing of your personal information as data controllers are covered by this Privacy Policy.

Please note that B2B Usage Data may be made visible, shared, or otherwise disclosed to your employer. When we make B2B Usage Data available to your employer, we do so based on the fact that your employer administers your account and that it has a legitimate interest in understanding and optimizing your usage of the O'Reilly learning platform. Your employer's processing of B2B Usage Data is governed by your employer's privacy policy. Please contact your employer if you have any questions or concerns in relation to your employer's use of B2B Usage Data.

Please note that this section may also apply in circumstances where you are obtaining access to the O'Reilly learning platform as an authorized user under a B2B account that is administered by an entity that is not your employer (for example, an organization for which you act as a contractor or as an agent).

Please note that your employer and O'Reilly may have executed legal terms, including ad hoc terms relating to the processing of your personal information, which deviate from the representations made under this section. If you have any questions relating to the stipulations between O'Reilly and your employer with respect to the processing of your personal information, please reach out to us using the contact information under the ["Contact Us" section](#questions) above, or reach out to your employer directly.

4\. How We Look After Your Personal Information and How Long We Keep It
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4.1 Security

We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of personal information against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. We also operate a policy of "privacy by design" by looking for opportunities to minimize the amount of personal information we hold about you.

The safeguards we use include:

* Ensuring the physical security of our offices, warehouses, or other sites
* Ensuring the physical and digital security of our equipment and devices by using appropriate password protection and encryption
* Using standard security protocols and mechanisms, such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption, to transmit sensitive data such as credit card details
* Maintaining a data protection policy for and delivering data protection training to our employees
* Limiting access to your personal information to those who need to use it in the course of their work

If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, please contact us using the methods outlined in the ["Contact Us" section](#questions) above.

### 4.2 Retention

We will keep your information for as long as is necessary to provide you with the services that you have requested from us or for as long as we reasonably require to retain the information for our lawful business purposes, such as for the purposes of exercising our legal rights or where we are permitted to do so. We operate a data retention policy and look to find ways to reduce the amount of information we hold about you and the length of time that we need to keep it.

Please contact us using the methods outlined in the ["Contact Us" section](#questions) above if you would like to obtain details of our retention periods for different aspects of your personal information.

### 4.3 Help keep your information safe

You can also play a part in keeping your information safe by:

* Choosing a strong account password, changing it regularly, and using different passwords for different online accounts.
* Keeping your login and password details confidential.
* Logging out of the website and closing the browser each time you have finished using it, especially when using a shared computer.
* Informing us if you know or suspect that your account has been compromised or if someone has accessed your account without your permission.
* Keeping your devices protected by using the latest version of your operating system and maintaining any necessary antivirus software.
* Being vigilant against fraudulent emails that may appear to be from us. Any emails that we send will come from an email address ending in either @oreilly.com (O'Reilly US), @mail.oreilly.com.cn (O'Reilly China), @oreilly.co.uk (O'Reilly UK), @oreilly.co.jp (O'Reilly Japan), or @safaribooksonline.com or @e.safaribooksonline.com (Safari Books).

5\. International Transfers of Your Information
-----------------------------------------------

O'Reilly and Safari are both based in the United States of America.

### 5.1 Data Privacy Framework: EU-US, Swiss-US, and UK Extension

O'Reilly Media, Inc. and Safari Books Online, LLC (and entities and subsidiaries that are, or may become, covered by O'Reilly or Safari's Data Privacy Framework certification) participate in and have certified their compliance with the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, the Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework, and the UK Extension to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (collectively the "Data Privacy Framework"). O'Reilly and Safari are committed to subjecting all personal information received from the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Switzerland ("DPF Covered Data"), respectively, in reliance on each Data Privacy Framework, to the Framework's applicable Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, and Enforcement and Liability, any applicable supplemental principles (collectively the "DPF Principles"). O'Reilly and Safari have each certified to the US Department of Commerce that it adheres to the DPF Principles. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework and to view O'Reilly and Safari's certifications, please visit the US Department of Commerce's Data Privacy Framework List, available at [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/). If there is any conflict between the terms in this Policy and the DPF Principles, the DPF Principles shall govern. Additionally, O'Reilly and Safari may protect your data through other legally valid methods, including international data transfer agreements.

Under the Data Privacy Framework, O'Reilly and Safari collect, use, and disclose DPF Covered Data for the purposes described in this Policy. Under the Data Privacy Framework, as described in Section 6 below, you may inquire as to whether O'Reilly and/or Safari is processing personal information about you, request access to personal information, and ask that we correct, amend, or delete your personal information where it is inaccurate or has been processed in violation of the DPF Principles. O'Reilly and Safari are responsible for the processing of personal information each receives, under each Data Privacy Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. The Data Privacy Framework requires that O'Reilly and Safari remain liable should their third parties process personal information in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles. O'Reilly and Safari comply with the DPF Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.

With respect to DPF Covered Data received or transferred pursuant to the Data Privacy Framework, O'Reilly and Safari are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"). The FTC has jurisdiction over O'Reilly and Safari's compliance with the Data Privacy Framework. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

If you are an EU or Swiss citizen and feel that we are not abiding by the terms of this Privacy Policy or that we are not in compliance with the DPF Principles, please contact us by using the [contact information](#questions) provided at the top of this Privacy Policy.

Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Data Privacy Framework website [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/How-to-Submit-a-Complaint-Relating-to-a-Participating-Organization-s-Compliance-with-the-DPF-Principles-dpf](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/How-to-Submit-a-Complaint-Relating-to-a-Participating-Organization-s-Compliance-with-the-DPF-Principles-dpf), you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted. For additional information, see [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/How-to-Submit-a-Complaint-Relating-to-a-Participating-Organization-s-Compliance-with-the-DPF-Principles-dpf](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/How-to-Submit-a-Complaint-Relating-to-a-Participating-Organization-s-Compliance-with-the-DPF-Principles-dpf).

If you are not satisfied with our response, O'Reilly and Safari further commit to cooperate with the EU data protection authorities (DPAs), the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) with regard to the investigation and resolution of unresolved Data Privacy Framework complaints concerning data transferred from the EU and Switzerland to the United States.

If you reside in the European Union, please be advised that your personal information will be processed outside of the European Economic Area (EEA). We will take all steps necessary to ensure that your information is adequately protected and processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy, including but not limited to:

### 6.3 What we need from you to process your requests

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and to enable you to exercise the rights set out above. This is a security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

You will not have to pay a fee to exercise the rights set out above. However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. We will try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

You might provide personal information directly to third parties as a consequence of your interactions with our website and other services offered by us. For example, our website may contain content and links to other third-party websites, plug-ins, and applications that are operated by third parties that may also operate cookies. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We don't control these third-party websites or cookies; we do not endorse, screen, or approve and are not responsible for their privacy statements; and this Privacy Policy does not apply to them. Please check the terms and conditions and privacy policy of the relevant third-party website to find out how they collect and use your information. If you do not want us to share your personal information with these companies, contact us using one of the methods described in the ["Contact Us" section](#questions) above.

Our services may include publicly accessible blogs, forums, social media pages, and private messaging features. By using such services, you assume the risk that the personal information provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties for any number of purposes. In addition, social media buttons such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Snapchat (that might include widgets such as the "share this" button or other interactive mini-programs) may be on our site. These features may collect your IP address and which page you are visiting on our site and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. These social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions with these features apart from your visit to our site are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

We may use third-party APIs and software development kits ("SDKs") as part of the functionality of our services. APIs and SDKs may allow third parties including analytics and advertising partners to collect your personal information for various purposes, including to provide analytics services and content that is more relevant to you.
