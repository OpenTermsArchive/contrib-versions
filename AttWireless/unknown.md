**PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION, INCLUDING OUR USE OF YOUR LOCATION INFORMATION (SEE SECTION 3.6). THIS AGREEMENT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS, AND ALSO LIMITS THE REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO YOU IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE.**

This Agreement, including the AT&T Privacy Policy Located at att.com/privacy, Customer Service Summary, and terms of service for wireless products, features, applications, and services ("Services") not otherwise described herein that are posted on applicable AT&T websites or devices, and any documents expressly referred to herein or therein, make up the complete agreement between you and AT&T and supersede any and all prior agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.

  
  

**1.0   TERM COMMITMENT, CHARGES, BILLING AND PAYMENT**

**1.1   What Is The Term Of My Service? How Can I Fulfill My Service Commitment? What are My Rights to Cancel Service and Terminate My Agreement?**

AT&T Wireless Service(s) may be used with: (a) a mobile device that contains a SIM that is assigned to your account (“Device”) and/or, (b) a device that is designed and purchased for use exclusively on AT&T's network (“Equipment”).

**Term of Service.** Your Agreement begins on the day we activate your Service(s) and continues through the Term of Service, typically a 12 month or 24 month period (“Service Commitment”), specified on your Customer Service Summary. At the end of your service commitment, this Agreement will automatically continue on a month-to-month basis. If your Agreement has no Service Commitment, it is a month-to-month Agreement.

**Fulfillment of Service Commitment.** You have received certain benefits from us in exchange for your Service Commitment, which may include, but are not limited to, a subsidized wireless device. There are two alternative ways to fulfill your Service Commitment. You can pay for the Services described in your Customer Service Summary for the term of your Service Commitment, or you can terminate your Agreement prior to the end of your Service Commitment and pay an Early Termination Fee (“ETF”). The Early Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is an alternative means for your perform your obligations under the Agreement that partially compensates us for the fact that the Service Commitment on which your rate plan is based was not completed.

**Your Termination Rights.** Within the first 14 days after service activation, you may terminate your Agreement for any reason and not be required to pay an ETF. If you terminate within three (3) days of accepting the Agreement, AT&T will refund your activation fee, if any. However, you agree to pay AT&T for all fees, charges, and other amounts incurred and owed under your Agreement, and you agree to return to AT&T any Equipment you purchased from AT&T in connection with your Service Commitment. If you fail to return this Equipment, you will be charged the difference between the amount you paid AT&T for the Equipment and the amount you would have been charged for the Equipment had you not agreed to a Service Commitment. AT&T also may charge you a restocking fee for any returned Equipment. Some dealers may impose additional fees.

After the first 14 days, you may terminate your Agreement for any reason. However, you agree to pay AT&T for all fees, charges, and other amounts incurred and owed under your Agreement along with the applicable ETF. The Early Termination Fee is either: (a) $325 minus $10 for each full month of your Service Commitment that you complete. or (b) $150 minus $4 for each full month of your Service Commitment that you complete. To determine whether your Equipment has a $325 Early Termination Fee or a $150 Early Termination Fee, check att.com/equipmentETF.

After your Service Commitment ends and you are on a month-to-month Agreement, you may terminate your Agreement at any time with 30 days notice without incurring an ETF. If you sign a new Agreement before the end of the term of your existing Agreement and terminate that new Agreement within 14 days as allowed above, you agree that you will be bound by the terms and conditions of your existing Agreement including fulfillment of any remaining Service Commitment thereunder.

  

**1.2   What are AT&T’s Rights to Cancel My Service(s) and Terminate My Agreement?**

AT&T may interrupt, suspend or cancel your Services and terminate your Agreement without advance notice for any reason including, but not limited to, the following:

*   Any conduct that we believe violates this Agreement or AT&T’s Acceptable Use Policy;
*   Any conduct that involves the use of abusive, derogatory, insulting, threatening, vulgar or similarly unreasonable language or behavior directed at any of our employees or representatives whether it be in person, over the phone, or in writing;
*   You use your Device/Equipment and/or our Services for an unlawful purpose;
*   You use your Device/Equipment and/or our Services in any way that: (a) is harmful to, interferes with, or negatively affects our network, other customers, or the network of any other provider, (b) is harmful to, interferes with, or negatively affects our Services or operations, (c) infringes intellectual property rights of AT&T or others, (d) results in the publication of threatening, offensive or illegal material, or (e) generates spam or other abusive messaging or calling, a security risk, or a violation of privacy;
*   You fail to make all required payments when due;
*   Your credit has deteriorated and/or we believe that there is a risk of non-payment;
*   You refuse to pay any required advance payment or deposit;
*   We discover that you are underage;
*   You provide inaccurate or misleading credit information. or
*   You modify your device from its manufacturer’s specifications.

  

AT&T's rights under this Section 1.2 are in addition to any specific rights that we reserve in other provisions of this Agreement to interrupt, suspend, modify, or cancel your Services and terminate your Agreement.

After your Service Commitment ends and you are on a month-to-month Agreement, AT&T may terminate your Agreement at any time with 30 days notice.

  

**1.3   Can AT&T Change My Terms And Rates?**

We may change any terms, conditions, rates, fees, expenses, or charges regarding your Services at any time. We will provide you with notice of material changes (other than changes to governmental fees, proportional charges for governmental mandates, roaming rates or administrative charges) either in your monthly bill or separately. You understand and agree that State and Federal Universal Service Fees and other governmentally imposed fees, whether or not assessed directly upon you, may be increased based upon the government's or our calculations.

IF WE INCREASE THE PRICE OF ANY OF THE SERVICES TO WHICH YOU SUBSCRIBE, BEYOND THE LIMITS SET FORTH IN YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE SUMMARY, OR IF WE MATERIALLY DECREASE THE GEOGRAPHICAL AREA IN WHICH YOUR AIRTIME RATE APPLIES (OTHER THAN A TEMPORARY DECREASE FOR REPAIRS OR MAINTENANCE), WE’LL DISCLOSE THE CHANGE AT LEAST ONE BILLING CYCLE IN ADVANCE (EITHER THROUGH A NOTICE WITH YOUR BILL, A TEXT MESSAGE TO YOUR DEVICE, OR OTHERWISE), AND YOU MAY TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT WITHOUT PAYING AN EARLY TERMINATION FEE OR RETURNING OR PAYING FOR ANY PROMOTIONAL ITEMS, PROVIDED YOUR NOTICE OF TERMINATION IS DELIVERED TO US WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS AFTER THE FIRST BILL REFLECTING THE CHANGE.

If you lose your eligibility for a particular rate plan, we may change your rate plan to one for which you qualify.

  

**1.4   How Will I Receive My Bill? What Charges Am I Responsible For? How Much Time Do I Have To Dispute My Bill?**

You will receive an electronic (paperless) bill at AT&T’s online account management site unless you tell us you want a paper bill. You will be given the option to choose electronic billing or paper billing when you purchase service. Each month we will send you an email notice when your electronic bill is available online. This will be sent to your official email address on file with AT&T. You are required to keep your email address current and to notify us immediately of any change in your email address. You always have the option of switching back to a paper bill by changing your billing preferences at AT&T’s online account management site. You will not receive a paper bill in the mail unless you expressly request one.

You are responsible for paying all charges for or resulting from Services provided under this Agreement, including any activation fee that may apply to each voice or data line. You will receive monthly bills that are due in full.

IF YOU DISPUTE ANY CHARGES ON YOUR BILL, YOU MUST NOTIFY US IN WRITING AT AT&T BILL DISPUTE, 1025 LENOX PARK, ATLANTA, GA 30319 WITHIN 100 DAYS OF THE DATE OF THE BILL OR YOU’LL HAVE WAIVED YOUR RIGHT TO DISPUTE THE BILL AND TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY LEGAL ACTION RAISING SUCH DISPUTE.

Charges include, without limitation, airtime, roaming, recurring monthly service, activation, administrative, and late payment charges. regulatory cost recovery and other surcharges. optional feature charges. toll, collect call and directory assistance charges. restoral and reactivation charges. any other charges or calls billed to your phone number. and applicable taxes and governmental fees, whether assessed directly upon you or upon AT&T.

To determine your primary place of use ("PPU") and which jurisdiction's taxes and assessments to collect, you’re required to provide us with your residential or business street address. If you don’t provide us with such address, or if it falls outside our licensed Services area, we may reasonably designate a PPU within the licensed Services area for you. You must live and have a mailing address within AT&T's owned network coverage area.

  

**1.5   How Does AT&T Calculate My Bill?**

Usage and monthly fees will be billed as specified in your customer service summary or rate plan information online. If the Equipment you order is shipped to you, your Services may be activated before you take delivery of the Equipment so that you can use it promptly upon receipt. Thus, you may be charged for Services while your Equipment is still in transit. If, upon receiving your first bill, you have been charged for Services while your Equipment was in transit, you may contact Customer Care 1-800-331-0500 to request a credit. Except as provided below, monthly Services and certain other charges are billed one month in advance, and there is no proration of such charges if Service is terminated on other than the last day of your billing cycle. Monthly Service and certain other charges are billed in arrears if you’re a former customer of AT&T Wireless and maintain uninterrupted Service on select AT&T rate plans, however, if you elect to receive your bills for your Services combined with your wireline phone bill (where available) you will be billed in advance as provided above. You agree to pay for all services used with your Device.

AIRTIME AND OTHER MEASURED USAGE ("CHARGEABLE TIME") IS BILLED IN FULL-MINUTE INCREMENTS, AND ACTUAL AIRTIME AND USAGE ARE ROUNDED UP TO THE NEXT FULL-MINUTE INCREMENT AT THE END OF EACH CALL FOR BILLING PURPOSES. AT&T CHARGES A FULL MINUTE OF AIRTIME USAGE FOR EVERY FRACTION OF THE LAST MINUTE OF AIRTIME USED ON EACH WIRELESS CALL. UNLESS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN YOUR PLAN, MINUTES WILL BE DEPLETED ACCORDING TO USAGE IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER: NIGHT AND WEEKEND MINUTES, MOBILE TO MOBILE MINUTES, ANYTIME MINUTES AND ROLLOVER, EXCEPT THAT MINUTES THAT ARE PART OF BOTH A LIMITED PACKAGE AND AN UNLIMITED PACKAGE WILL NOT BE DEPLETED FROM THE LIMITED PACKAGE. Chargeable Time begins for outgoing calls when you press SEND (or similar key) and for incoming calls when a signal connection from the caller is established with our facilities. Chargeable Time ends after you press END (or similar key), but not until your wireless telephone's signal of call disconnect is received by our facilities and the call disconnect signal has been confirmed.

All outgoing calls for which we receive answer supervision or which have at least 30 seconds of Chargeable Time, including ring time, shall incur a minimum of one minute airtime charge. Answer supervision is generally received when a call is answered. however, answer supervision may also be generated by voicemail systems, private branch exchanges, and interexchange switching equipment. Chargeable Time may include time for us to recognize that only one party has disconnected from the call, time to clear the channels in use, and ring time. Chargeable Time may also occur from other uses of our facilities, including by way of example, voicemail deposits and retrievals, and call transfers. Calls that begin in one rate period and end in another rate period may be billed in their entirety at the rates for the period in which the call began.

DATA TRANSPORT OR USAGE IS CALCULATED IN FULL-KILOBYTE INCREMENTS, AND ACTUAL TRANSPORT OR USAGE IS ROUNDED UP TO THE NEXT FULL-KILOBYTE INCREMENT AT THE END OF EACH DATA SESSION FOR BILLING PURPOSES. AT&T CALCULATES A FULL KILOBYTE OF DATA TRANSPORT/USAGE FOR EVERY FRACTION OF THE LAST KILOBYTE OF DATA TRANSPORT/USAGE USED ON EACH DATA SESSION. TRANSPORT OR USAGE IS BILLED EITHER BY THE KILOBYTE (“KB”) OR MEGABYTE ("MB"). IF BILLED BY MB, THE FULL KBs CALCULATED FOR EACH DATA SESSION DURING THE BILLING PERIOD ARE TOTALED AND ROUNDED UP TO NEXT FULL MB INCREMENT TO DETERMINE BILLING. IF BILLED BY KB, THE FULL KBs CALCULATED FOR EACH DATA SESSION DURING THE BILLING PERIOD ARE TOTALED TO DETERMINE BILLING. NETWORK OVERHEAD, SOFTWARE UPDATE REQUESTS, EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS, AND RESEND REQUESTS CAUSED BY NETWORK ERRORS CAN INCREASE MEASURED KILOBYTES. DATA TRANSPORT/USAGE OCCURS WHENEVER YOUR DEVICE IS CONNECTED TO OUR NETWORK AND IS ENGAGED IN ANY DATA TRANSMISSION, AS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN SECTION 6.4.

If you select a rate plan that includes a predetermined allotment of Services (for example, a predetermined amount of airtime, megabytes or messages), unless otherwise specifically provided as a part of such rate plan, any unused allotment of Services from one billing cycle will not carry over to any other billing cycle. We may bill you in a format as we determine from time to time. Additional charges may apply for additional copies of your bill, or for detailed information about your usage of Services.

**Delayed Billing:** Billing of usage for calls, messages, data or other Services (such as usage when roaming on other carriers’ networks, including internationally) may occasionally be delayed. Such usage charges may appear in a later billing cycle, will be deducted from Anytime monthly minutes or other Services allotments for the month when the usage is actually billed, and may result in additional charges for that month. Those minutes will be applied against your Anytime monthly minutes in the month in which the calls appear on your bill. You also remain responsible for paying your monthly Service fee if your Service is suspended for nonpayment. We may require payment by money order, cashier's check, or a similarly secure form of payment at our discretion.

  

**1.6   Are Advance Payments And/Or Deposits Required?**

We may require you to make deposits or advance payments for Services, which we may offset against any unpaid balance on your account. Interest won’t be paid on advance payments or deposits unless required by law. We may require additional advance payments or deposits if we determine that the initial payment was inadequate. Based on your creditworthiness as we determine it, we may establish a credit limit and restrict Services or features. If your account balance goes beyond the limit we set for you, we may immediately interrupt or suspend Services until your balance is brought below the limit. Any charges you incur in excess of your limit become immediately due. If you have more than one account with us, you must keep all accounts in good standing to maintain Services. If one account is past due or over its limit, all accounts in your name are subject to interruption or termination and all other available collection remedies.

  

**1.7   What if I fail to pay my AT&T Bill when it is due?**

Late payment charges are based on the state to which the area code of the wireless telephone number assigned to you is assigned by the North American Numbering Plan Administration (for area code assignments see nationalnanpa.com/area\_code\_maps). You agree that for amounts not paid by the due date, AT&T may charge, as a part of its rates and charges, and you agree to pay, a late payment fee of $5 in CT, D.C., DE, IL, KS, MA, MD, ME, MI, MO, NH, NJ, NY, OH, OK, PA, RI, VA, VT, WI, WV. the late payment charge is 1.5% of the balance carried forward to the next bill in all other states. **In the event you fail to pay billed charges when due and it becomes necessary for AT&T to refer your account(s) to a third party for collection, AT&T will charge a collection fee at the maximum percentage permitted by applicable law, but not to exceed 18% to cover the internal collection-related costs AT&T has incurred on such account(s) through and including the date on which AT&T refer(s) the account(s) to such third party.**

You expressly authorize, and specifically consent to allowing, AT&T and/or its outside collection agencies, outside counsel, or other agents to contact you in connection with any and all matters relating to unpaid past due charges billed by AT&T to you. You agree that, for attempts to collect unpaid past due charges, such contact may be made to any mailing address, telephone number, cellular phone number, e-mail address, or any other electronic address that you have provided, or may in the future provide, to AT&T. You agree and acknowledge that any e-mail address or any other electronic address that you provide to AT&T is your private address and is not accessible to unauthorized third parties. For attempts to collect unpaid charges, you agree that in addition to individual persons attempting to communicate directly with you, any type of contact described above may be made using, among other methods, pre-recorded or artificial voice messages delivered by an automatic telephone dialing system, pre-set e-mail messages delivered by an automatic e-mailing system, or any other pre-set electronic messages delivered by any other automatic electronic messaging system.

  

**1.8   What Happens If My Check Bounces?**

We’ll charge you up to $30 (depending on applicable law) for any check or other instrument (including credit card charge backs) returned unpaid for any reason.

  

**1.9   Are There Business or Government Benefits?**

You may receive or be eligible for certain rate plans, discounts, features, promotions, and other benefits ("Benefits") through a business or government customer's agreement with us ("Business Agreement"). All such Benefits are provided to you solely as a result of the corresponding Business Agreement, and may be modified or terminated without notice. You may also be eligible for certain additional Services. Please see att.com/iru-additional-terms for such Services and the associated additional terms, which are hereby incorporated by reference.

If a business or government entity pays your charges or is otherwise liable for the charges, you authorize us to share your account information with it or its authorized agents. If you use Service(s) and/or receive certain Benefits tied to a Business Agreement with us, but you’re liable for your own charges, then you authorize us to share enough account information with it or its authorized agents to verify your continuing eligibility for those Services or Benefits.

You may receive Benefits because of your agreement to have the charges for your Services, billed ("Joint Billing") by a wireline company affiliated with AT&T ("Affiliate") or because you subscribe to certain services provided by an Affiliate. If you cancel Joint Billing or the Affiliate service your rates will be adjusted without notice to a rate plan for which you qualify.

  

**1.10   Who Can Access My Account and for What Purpose?**

You authorize us to provide information about and to make changes to your account, including new or extended Service Commitments and the purchase of Products and/or Services, upon the direction of any person able to provide information we deem sufficient to identify you. In addition, you may designate individuals who are authorized to make certain changes to your account (“Authorized Users”). You are responsible for all changes made by such Authorized Users, including new or extended Service Commitments and the purchase of Products or Services. You consent to the use by us or our authorized agents of regular mail, predictive or autodialing equipment, email, text messaging, facsimile or other reasonable means to contact you to advise you about our Services or other matters we believe may be of interest to you. In any event, we reserve the right to contact you by any means regarding customer service-related notifications, or other such information.

  

**2.0   HOW DO I RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH AT&T?**

  

**2.1   Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration**

**PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.**

Summary:

Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by calling our customer service department at 1-800-331-0500. **In the unlikely event that AT&T's customer service department is unable to resolve a complaint you may have to your satisfaction (or if AT&T has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.** Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. **Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis. class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.** For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $75,000, AT&T will pay all costs of the arbitration. Moreover, in arbitration you are entitled to recover attorneys' fees from AT&T to at least the same extent as you would be in court.

In addition, under certain circumstances (as explained below), AT&T will pay you more than the amount of the arbitrator's award and will pay your attorney (if any) twice his or her reasonable attorneys' fees if the arbitrator awards you an amount that is greater than what AT&T has offered you to settle the dispute.

  

**2.2   Arbitration Agreement**

(1) AT&T and you agree to arbitrate **all disputes and claims** between us. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:

*   claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;
*   claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);
*   claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class. and
*   claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.

  

References to "AT&T," "you," and "us" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or Devices under this or prior Agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, including, for example, the Federal Communications Commission. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. **You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and AT&T are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.** This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survve termination of this Agreement.

(2) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice to AT&T should be addressed to: Office for Dispute Resolution, AT&T, 1025 Lenox Park Blvd., Atlanta, GA 30319 ("Notice Address"). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute. and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). If AT&T and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or AT&T may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by AT&T or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or AT&T is entitled. You may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate arbitration at att.com/arbitration-forms.

(3) After AT&T receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $75,000. (The filing fee currently is $125 for claims under $10,000 but is subject to change by the arbitration provider. If you are unable to pay this fee, AT&T will pay it directly upon receiving a written request at the Notice Address.) The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. (You may obtain information that is designed for non-lawyers about the arbitration process at att.com/arbitration-information.) The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide. Unless AT&T and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. Except as otherwise provided for herein, AT&T will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse AT&T for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.

(4) If, after finding in your favor in any respect on the merits of your claim, the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of AT&T's last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, then AT&T will:

*   pay you the amount of the award or $10,000 ("the alternative payment"), whichever is greater. and
*   pay your attorney, if any, twice the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration ("the attorney premium").

  

If AT&T did not make a written offer to settle the dispute before an arbitrator was selected, you and your attorney will be entitled to receive the alternative payment and the attorney premium, respectively, if the arbitrator awards you any relief on the merits. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.

(5) The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed in paragraph (4) supplements any right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law. Thus, if you would be entitled to a larger amount under the applicable law, this provision does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding you that amount. However, you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or costs. Although under some laws AT&T may have a right to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, AT&T agrees that it will not seek such an award.

(6) The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. **YOU AND AT&T AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.** Further, unless both you and AT&T agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.

(7) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if AT&T makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) during your Service Commitment, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.

We do not filter, edit or control voice, text, or email messages, or guarantee the security of messages. We can interrupt, restrict or terminate VMTT without notice, if your use of VMTT adversely impacts AT&T's network, for example that could occur from abnormal calling patterns or an unusually large number of repeated calls and messages. or if your use is otherwise abusive, fraudulent, or does not comply with the law.

You are solely responsible for and will comply with all applicable laws as to the content of any text messages or emails you receive from VMTT that you forward or include in a reply to any other person. You authorize AT&T or a third party working on AT&T's behalf to listen to, and transcribe all or part of a voicemail message and to convert such voicemail message into text/email, and to use voicemail messages and transcriptions to enhance, train and improve AT&T's speech recognition and transcription services, software and equipment.

Charges for VMTT include the conversion of the voicemail message and the text message sent to your wireless device. Additional charges, however, may apply to receiving email on your wireless device from VMTT, as well as, replying to or forwarding VMTT messages via SMS (text) or email, depending on your plan.

SMS (text messaging) blocking is incompatible with VMTT. (If you do not have a texting plan on your handset, we add a texting pay per use feature when you add VMTT with text delivery.) If you are traveling outside the U.S. coverage area, you will incur international data charges for emails received from VMTT, as well as, charges for emails you respond to or forward from VMTT, unless you have an international data plan and the usage falls within the plan's usage limits.

Transcription times cannot be guaranteed. Customers purchasing email delivery are responsible for providing a correct email address and updating the email address when changes to the email account are made.

If you choose SMS (text) delivery, VMTT only converts the first 480 characters of a voicemail message into text and you will receive up to three text messages of a transcribed message. The transcription, therefore, may not include the entire voicemail message with SMS delivery. Adding VMTT will create a new voicemail box and all messages and greetings will be deleted from your current voicemail box.

Each WHP Device can be associated with only one (1) phone number. This WHP Device is sold for use on the AT&T wireless network and is not compatible with other wireless networks.

One of the following eligible voice plans are required: 1) add a line to your FamilyTalk plan or 2) Wireless Home Phone unlimited plan. If on the FamilyTalk plan, the WHP Service will use your package minutes shared by the lines on the plan. See att.com for more details. The AT&T Wireless Home Phone unlimited rate plan includes inbound and outbound Anytime Minute domestic calls made to the 50 United States, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and Northern Mariana Islands. See Section 5.4 for additional details on unlimited voice services. International roaming is not enabled. Text messaging and other data services and features are not available with the WHP Service.

The Wireless Home Phone unlimited plan is designed for use with only the WHP Device(s) that you have purchased and may not be used with any other device (via SIM-card transfer or any other means). If it is determined that you are using the Wireless Home Phone unlimited plan on a device that is not a WHP Device, AT&T reserves the right to switch you to an appropriate wireless voice plan and bill you the associated fees for such plan.

A new wireless number will be provided if you are not porting an existing wireless or home phone number to the WHP Service. Your WHP Device should be operated in a location where AT&T is authorized to provide wireless service. If your WHP Device is used while on other carrier networks, AT&T’s off-net usage restrictions apply. Please see section 4.5 of your Wireless Customer Agreement or att.com for details.

AT&T does not represent that the WHP Service will be equivalent to landline service. Because the WHP Service uses a wireless network, you may experience occasional service limitations inherent to wireless service e.g., dropped calls. AT&T recommends that you place your WHP Device on a hard surface with an unobstructed view of the outdoors in a location in the home that has an AT&T wireless signal strength that is acceptable to you.

**911 calls are routed based on the wireless network's automatic location technology. You should expect to provide your home address to the emergency response center responsible for sending first responders (e.g. police, medical assistance, or fire) to your location.**

While battery backup is provided for your WHP Device, if your WHP Device is connected to a landline phone that requires external electric power to operate e.g., cordless phones, WHP Service (including the ability to make and receive 911 calls) will not be available during a power outage.

WHP Service is compatible with home answering machines but may not support your fax machine, alarm services including medical alert services, dial-up internet service, or credit card machines. The WHP Service is not compatible with television services that require you to connect telephone service to television equipment such as digital video recorder equipment or on-demand movie services.

Pooled Data Connect Plans ("Pooled Plans") available only to customers with a qualified AT&T Business Agreement for wireless Services and their respective Corporate Responsibility Users ("CRUs"). Consolidated billing is required. WIN Advantage® may also be required. Within a single Foundation Account (FAN), Customer's CRUs on an eligible Pooled Plan aggregate or "pool" their included wireless data usage ("Included Usage"), creating a "Pool".

To pool together, each CRU in the Pool must subscribe to a Pooled Plan that has the same amount of Included Usage and the same Additional Kilobyte charge ("Similar Pooled Plan"). Every billing cycle, each CRU first uses his or her Included Usage. If a CRU does not use all his or her Included Usage it creates an underage in the amount of unused kilobytes ("Under Usage"). If a CRU uses more than his or her Included Usage it creates an overage with respect to kilobytes of data usage ("Over Usage"). The Pool's Under Usage kilobytes and Over Usage kilobytes are then aggregated respectively and compared. If the aggregate Under Usage kilobytes exceed the aggregate Over Usage kilobytes, then no CRU in the Pool pays Additional Kilobyte charges. If the aggregate Over Usage kilobytes exceeds the aggregate Under Usage kilobytes, then the ratio of Under Usage kilobytes to Over Usage kilobytes is applied to the data usage of each CRU in the Pool with Overage Usage, resulting in a monetary credit against the corresponding Additional Kilobyte charges.

For example, if a Pool has 900 Under Usage kilobytes and 1000 Over Usage kilobytes (90%), then each CRU with Over Usage will receive a credit equal to 90% of his or her Additional Kilobyte charges. CRUs changing price points or migrating to Pooled Plans during a bill cycle may result in one-time prorations or other minor impacts to the credit calculation. Credits will only appear on WIN Advantage®. Customer may have more than one Pool within a FAN provided that Customer may only have one Pool for Similar Pooled Plans within a FAN. however, an individual CRU can only be in one Pool at a time.

AT&T reserves the right to limit the number of CRUs in a Pool due to business needs and system limitations. CRUs on Pooled Plans and CRUs participating in a legacy Pooled Data Connect plan pool created prior to February 17, 2006 ("Legacy Pool") cannot be in the same Pool but can be within the same FAN. End users on non-pooling AT&T plans may be included in the same FAN as CRUs on Pooled Plans. however these non-pooling end users will not receive the pooling benefits or contribute Included Usage to a Pool.
