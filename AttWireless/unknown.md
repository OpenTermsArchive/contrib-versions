1.0 TERM COMMITMENT, CHARGES, BILLING AND PAYMENT 1.1 What Is The Term Of My Service? How Can I Fulfill My Service Commitment? What are My Rights to Cancel Service and Terminate My Agreement?

AT&T wireless Service(s) may be used with: (a) a mobile device that contains a SIM that is assigned to your account ("Device") and/or, (b) a device that is designed and purchased for use exclusively on AT&T's network ("Equipment").

Term of Service.

Your Agreement begins on the day we activate your Service(s) and continues through the Term of Service, typically a 12 month or 24 month period ("Service Commitment"), specified on your Customer Service Summary. At the end of your service commitment, this Agreement will automatically continue on a month-to-month basis. If your Agreement has no Service Commitment, it is a month-to-month Agreement.

Device Activation.

If You purchased a device that was shipped to You, You agree to activate the device within seven (7) days of the shipment date. If Your device is not activated by You, we may activate the device for You within a month of shipping and Your monthly recurring charges, and any applicable Service Commitment, will begin.

Fulfillment of Service Commitment.

You have received certain benefits from us in exchange for your Service Commitment, which may include, but are not limited to, a subsidized wireless device. There are two alternative ways to fulfill your Service Commitment. You can pay for the Services described in your Customer Service Summary for the term of your Service Commitment, or you can terminate your Agreement prior to the end of your Service Commitment and pay an Early Termination Fee ("ETF"). The Early Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is an alternative means for you to perform your obligations under the Agreement that partially compensates us for the fact that the Service Commitment on which your rate plan is based was not completed.

Your Termination Rights.

Within the first 14 days after service activation, you may terminate your Agreement for any reason and not be required to pay an ETF. If you terminate within three (3) days of accepting the Agreement, AT&T will refund your activation fee, if any. However, you agree to pay AT&T for all fees, charges, and other amounts incurred and owed under your Agreement, and you agree to return to AT&T any Equipment you purchased from AT&T in connection with your Service Commitment. If you fail to return this Equipment, you will be charged the difference between the amount you paid AT&T for the Equipment and the amount you would have been charged for the Equipment had you not agreed to a Service Commitment. AT&T also may charge you a restocking fee for any returned Equipment. Some dealers may impose additional fees.

After the first 14 days, you may terminate your Agreement for any reason. However, you agree to pay AT&T for all fees, charges, and other amounts incurred and owed under your Agreement along with the applicable ETF. The Early Termination Fee is either: (a) $325 or (b) $150. The ETF reduces each full month of your Service Commitment that you complete. To determine whether your Equipment has a $325 Early Termination Fee or a $150 Early Termination Fee, and the amount of reduction, check att.com/equipmentETF.

After your Service Commitment ends and you are on a month-to-month Agreement, you may terminate your Agreement at any time with 30 days notice without incurring an ETF. If you sign a new Agreement before the end of the term of your existing Agreement and terminate that new Agreement within 14 days as allowed above, you agree that you will be bound by the terms and conditions of your existing Agreement including fulfillment of any remaining Service Commitment thereunder.

1.2 What are AT&T's Rights to Cancel My Service(s) and Terminate My Agreement?

AT&T may interrupt, suspend or cancel your Services and terminate your Agreement without advance notice for any reason including, but not limited to, the following:

*   Any conduct that we believe violates this Agreement or AT&T's Acceptable Use Policy;
*   Any conduct that involves the use of abusive, derogatory, insulting, threatening, vulgar or similarly unreasonable language or behavior directed at any of our employees or representatives whether it be in person, over the phone, or in writing;
*   Any abusive use of our network or Services;
*   You use your Device/Equipment and/or our Services for an unlawful or fraudulent purpose;
*   You use your Device/Equipment and/or our Services in any way that: (a) is harmful to, interferes with, or negatively affects our network, other customers, or the network of any other provider, (b) is harmful to, interferes with, or negatively affects our Services or operations, (c) infringes intellectual property rights of AT&T or others, (d) results in the publication of threatening, offensive or illegal material, or (e) generates spam or other abusive messaging or calling, a security risk, or a violation of privacy;
*   You resell our Services either alone or as part of any other good or service;
*   Upon receipt of an order by a state or federal agency;
*   You fail to make all required payments when due;
*   Your credit has deteriorated and/or we believe that there is a risk of non-payment;
*   You refuse to pay any required advance payment or deposit;
*   We discover that you are underage;
*   You provide inaccurate or misleading credit information. or
*   You modify your device from its manufacturer's specifications.

AT&T's rights under this Section 1.2 are in addition to any specific rights that we reserve in other provisions of this Agreement to interrupt, suspend, modify, or cancel your Services and terminate your Agreement.

After your Service Commitment ends and you are on a month-to-month Agreement, AT&T may terminate your Agreement at any time with 30 days notice.

1.3 Can AT&T Change My Terms And Rates?

From time to time we might make changes to this Agreement. This could include charges, discounts, coverage, technologies, and other Service terms. We commit that we’ll provide you with notice either in your monthly bill or separately at least 30 days before we make any materially adverse change. So, for instance, if we increase your rate plan or the price of any of your Services more than what we’ve previously told you (such as in your Customer Service Summary) those would be materially adverse changes. But, not all changes are materially adverse. For example, here is a list of some changes that are not materially adverse: (1) increases to international roaming rates. (2) increases to charges for international long distance rates. (3) increases to AT&T fees and taxes imposed by the government and passed on to you. and (4) changes to surcharges and regulatory cost recovery charges that do not exceed the limits set forth in your Agreement. We also want you to know that, if we make a materially adverse change during your Service Commitment (if any), you can cancel impacted Service without paying an early termination fee. **But, you do need to notify us of your desire to cancel Service at the following address within 30 days of receiving the notice: AT&T, PO Box 10330, Fort Wayne, IN 46851.**

1.4 How Will I Receive My Bill? What Charges Am I Responsible For? How Much Time Do I Have To Dispute My Bill?

You will receive an electronic (paperless) bill at AT&T's online account management site unless you tell us you want a paper bill. You will be given the option to choose electronic billing or paper billing when you purchase service. Each month we will send you an email notice when your electronic bill is available online. This will be sent to your official email address on file with AT&T. You are required to keep your email address current and to notify us immediately of any change in your email address. You always have the option of switching back to a paper bill by changing your billing preferences at AT&T's online account management site. You will not receive a paper bill in the mail unless you expressly request one.

You are responsible for paying all charges for or resulting from Services provided under this Agreement, including any activation fee that may apply to each voice or data line. You will receive monthly bills that are due in full.

IF YOU DISPUTE ANY CHARGES ON YOUR BILL, YOU MUST NOTIFY US IN WRITING AT AT&T BILL DISPUTE, 1025 LENOX PARK, ATLANTA, GA 30319 WITHIN 100 DAYS OF THE DATE OF THE BILL OR YOU'LL HAVE WAIVED YOUR RIGHT TO DISPUTE THE BILL AND TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY LEGAL ACTION RAISING SUCH DISPUTE.

Charges include, without limitation, airtime, roaming, recurring monthly service, activation, administrative, and late payment charges. regulatory cost recovery and other surcharges. optional feature charges. toll, collect call and directory assistance charges. restoral and reactivation charges. any other charges or calls billed to your phone number. and applicable taxes and governmental fees, whether assessed directly upon you or upon AT&T.

To determine your primary place of use ("PPU") and which jurisdiction's taxes and assessments to collect, you're required to provide us with your residential or business street address. If you don't provide us with such address, or if it falls outside our licensed Services area, we may reasonably designate a PPU within the licensed Services area for you. You must live and have a mailing address within AT&T's owned network coverage area or its assignee’s or successor’s.

**Auto Bill Pay:** If you enroll your account for automatic bill payments ("Auto Bill Pay"), you authorized AT&T to charge your debit/credit card or bank account automatically to pay your monthly statements, as well as any unpaid balances and fees if your AT&T service is disconnected. To cancel your authorization for Auto Bill Pay, you must call 1-800-288-2020. You should also contact your card issuer or financial institution to advise that you have cancelled your enrollment. You will lose any promotional credits associated with your account if you opt out from Auto Bill Pay.

**Payment Upon Cancellation:** If you were required to provide a credit or debit card to establish service, you acknowledge you have the authority to authorize charges to that card. This may or may not be the same credit or debit card used for Auto Bill Pay. By giving us your credit or debit card information, which you can change at any time by contacting us, you authorize us to apply this method of payment, in accordance with applicable law, to satisfy any and all amounts due upon cancellation of service. You also acknowledge and agree that you are required to maintain current credit or debit card information with us and agree to notify us whenever there is a change in such information, such as a change in the card number or the expiration date and, additionally, that AT&T may obtain such updated information through payment card networks, card issuers or other third party sources.to which you may have been required to provide credit or debit card information.

1.5 How Does AT&T Calculate My Bill?

Usage and monthly fees will be billed as specified in your Customer Service Summary or rate plan information online. If the Equipment you order is shipped to you, your Services may be activated before you take delivery of the Equipment so that you can use it promptly upon receipt. Thus, you may be charged for Services while your Equipment is still in transit. If, upon receiving your first bill, you have been charged for Services while your Equipment was in transit, you may contact Customer Care 1-800-331-0500 to request a credit. Except as provided below, monthly Services and certain other charges are billed one month in advance, and there is no proration of such charges if Service is terminated on other than the last day of your billing cycle. Monthly Service and certain other charges are billed in arrears if you're a former customer of AT&T Wireless and maintain uninterrupted Service on select AT&T rate plans, however, if you elect to receive your bills for your Services combined with your wireline phone bill (where available) you will be billed in advance as provided above. You agree to pay for all services used with your Device.

AIRTIME AND OTHER MEASURED USAGE ("CHARGEABLE TIME") IS BILLED IN FULL-MINUTE INCREMENTS, AND ACTUAL AIRTIME AND USAGE ARE ROUNDED UP TO THE NEXT FULL-MINUTE INCREMENT AT THE END OF EACH CALL FOR BILLING PURPOSES. AT&T CHARGES A FULL MINUTE OF AIRTIME USAGE FOR EVERY FRACTION OF THE LAST MINUTE OF AIRTIME USED ON EACH WIRELESS CALL. UNLESS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN YOUR PLAN, MINUTES WILL BE DEPLETED ACCORDING TO USAGE IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER: NIGHT AND WEEKEND MINUTES, MOBILE TO MOBILE MINUTES, ANYTIME MINUTES AND ROLLOVER, EXCEPT THAT MINUTES THAT ARE PART OF BOTH A LIMITED PACKAGE AND AN UNLIMITED PACKAGE WILL NOT BE DEPLETED FROM THE LIMITED PACKAGE. Chargeable Time begins for outgoing calls when you press SEND (or similar key) and for incoming calls when a signal connection from the caller is established with our facilities. Chargeable Time ends after you press END (or similar key), but not until your wireless telephone's signal of call disconnect is received by our facilities and the call disconnect signal has been confirmed.

All outgoing calls for which we receive answer supervision or which have at least 30 seconds of Chargeable Time, including ring time, shall incur a minimum of one minute airtime charge. Answer supervision is generally received when a call is answered. however, answer supervision may also be generated by voicemail systems, private branch exchanges, and interexchange switching equipment. Chargeable Time may include time for us to recognize that only one party has disconnected from the call, time to clear the channels in use, and ring time. Chargeable Time may also occur from other uses of our facilities, including by way of example, voicemail deposits and retrievals, and call transfers. Calls that begin in one rate period and end in another rate period may be billed in their entirety at the rates for the period in which the call began.

DATA TRANSPORT OR USAGE IS CALCULATED IN FULL-KILOBYTE INCREMENTS, AND ACTUAL TRANSPORT OR USAGE IS ROUNDED UP TO THE NEXT FULL-KILOBYTE INCREMENT AT THE END OF EACH DATA SESSION FOR BILLING PURPOSES. AT&T CALCULATES A FULL KILOBYTE OF DATA TRANSPORT/USAGE FOR EVERY FRACTION OF THE LAST KILOBYTE OF DATA TRANSPORT/USAGE USED ON EACH DATA SESSION. TRANSPORT OR USAGE IS BILLED EITHER BY THE KILOBYTE ("KB") OR MEGABYTE ("MB"). IF BILLED BY MB, THE FULL KBs CALCULATED FOR EACH DATA SESSION DURING THE BILLING PERIOD ARE TOTALED AND ROUNDED UP TO NEXT FULL MB INCREMENT TO DETERMINE BILLING. IF BILLED BY KB, THE FULL KBs CALCULATED FOR EACH DATA SESSION DURING THE BILLING PERIOD ARE TOTALED TO DETERMINE BILLING. NETWORK OVERHEAD, SOFTWARE UPDATE REQUESTS, EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS, AND RESEND REQUESTS CAUSED BY NETWORK ERRORS CAN INCREASE MEASURED KILOBYTES. DATA TRANSPORT/USAGE OCCURS WHENEVER YOUR DEVICE IS CONNECTED TO OUR NETWORK AND IS ENGAGED IN ANY DATA TRANSMISSION, AS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN SECTION 6.4.

If you select a rate plan that includes a predetermined allotment of Services (for example, a predetermined amount of airtime, megabytes or messages), unless otherwise specifically provided as a part of such rate plan, any unused allotment of Services from one billing cycle will not carry over to any other billing cycle. We may bill you in a format as we determine from time to time. Additional charges may apply for additional copies of your bill, or for detailed information about your usage of Services.

**Delayed Billing:** Billing of usage for calls, messages, data or other Services (such as usage when roaming on other carriers' networks, including internationally) may occasionally be delayed. Such usage charges may appear in a later billing cycle, will be deducted from Anytime monthly minutes or other Services allotments for the month when the usage is actually billed, and may result in additional charges for that month. Those minutes will be applied against your Anytime monthly minutes in the month in which the calls appear on your bill. You also remain responsible for paying your monthly Service fee if your Service is suspended for nonpayment. We may require payment by money order, cashier's check, or a similarly secure form of payment at our discretion.

1.6 Are Advance Payments And/Or Deposits Required?

We may require you to make deposits or advance payments for Services, which we may offset against any unpaid balance on your account. Interest won't be paid on advance payments or deposits unless required by law. We may require additional advance payments or deposits if we determine that the initial payment was inadequate. Based on your creditworthiness as we determine it, we may establish a credit limit and restrict Services or features. If your account balance goes beyond the limit we set for you, we may immediately interrupt or suspend Services until your balance is brought below the limit. Any charges you incur in excess of your limit become immediately due. If you have more than one account with us, you must keep all accounts in good standing to maintain Services. If one account is past due or over its limit, all accounts in your name are subject to interruption or termination and all other available collection remedies.

1.7 What if I fail to pay my AT&T Bill when it is due?

You agree that for each bill not paid in full by the due date, AT&T may charge and you will pay a late payment fee. Restrictive endorsements are void.

You expressly authorize, and specifically consent to allowing, AT&T and/or its outside collection agencies, outside counsel, or other agents to contact you in connection with any and all matters relating to unpaid past due charges billed by AT&T to you. You agree that, for attempts to collect unpaid past due charges, such contact may be made to any mailing address, telephone number, cellular phone number, e-mail address, or any other electronic address that you have provided, or may in the future provide, to AT&T. You agree and acknowledge that any e-mail address or any other electronic address that you provide to AT&T is your private address and is not accessible to unauthorized third parties. For attempts to collect unpaid charges, you agree that in addition to individual persons attempting to communicate directly with you, any type of contact described above may be made using, among other methods, pre-recorded or artificial voice messages delivered by an automatic telephone dialing system, pre-set e-mail messages delivered by an automatic e-mailing system, or any other pre-set electronic messages delivered by any other automatic electronic messaging system.

1.8 What Happens If My Check Bounces?

We'll charge you up to $30 (depending on applicable law) for any check or other instrument (including credit card charge backs) returned unpaid for any reason.

1.9 Are There Business or Government Benefits?

You may receive or be eligible for certain discounts, credits, promotions, and other benefits ("Benefits") through a business or government customer's agreement with us ("Business Agreement"). All such Benefits are provided to you solely as a result of the corresponding Business Agreement, and may be modified or terminated without notice. You may also be eligible for certain additional rate plans and/or other Services. Please see https://www.att.com/iru-additional-terms for such Services and the associated additional terms, which are hereby incorporated by reference.

If a business or government entity pays your charges or is otherwise liable for the charges, you authorize us to share your account information with it or its authorized agents. If you use Service(s) and/or receive certain Benefits tied to a Business Agreement with us, but you're liable for your own charges, then you authorize us to share enough account information with it or its authorized agents to verify your continuing eligibility for those Services or Benefits.

You may receive Benefits because of your agreement to have the charges for your Services, billed ("Joint Billing") by a wireline company affiliated with AT&T ("Affiliate") or because you subscribe to certain services provided by an Affiliate. If you cancel Joint Billing or the Affiliate service your rates will be adjusted without notice to a rate plan for which you qualify.

1.10 Who Can Access My Account and for What Purpose?

You may add an Authorized/Approved User to Your account. Doing so authorizes Us to provide the Authorized/Approved User with information about, and access to, Your account. Authorized/Approved Users include:

*   (a) A person authorized by You to act on Your behalf with respect to Your account when the person is in a retail store;
*   (b) A person who calls into customer service and provides sufficient account information. and
*   (c) A person who registers for secondary access to Your account in AT&T's online account management system, provides sufficient account information, and has access to a device that is billed to Your account.
    
    Authorized/Approved Users can view Your account and payment information, make changes to the plans under Your account, purchase devices including via financing agreements, add new lines of service, and perform other account functions. You are responsible for all changes made or actions taken by Authorized/Approved Users.
    
    By taking these actions as Your agent, Authorized/Approved Users authorize Us to perform a credit check on You, share Your credit information between Us and our Affiliates, and obtain a credit report on You from a consumer reporting agency.
    
    You may remove an Authorized/Approved User at any time by contacting Us. The removal will take effect after we have a reasonable opportunity to process the request. If You remove an Authorized/Approved User, we recommend that You reset your account passcode and online credentials.
    
    You consent to the use by us or our authorized agents of regular mail, predictive or autodialing equipment, email, text messaging, facsimile or other reasonable means to contact you to advise you about our Services or other matters we believe may be of interest to you. In any event, we reserve the right to contact you by any means regarding customer service-related notifications, or other such information.
    
    1.11 How will AT&T communicate with me about my Service?
    
    As your wireless carrier, we will need to communicate with you about your Service on occasion. We and our authorized agents may contact you by: bill message, text message, email, phone call, postal mail, in-app notification, push notification, or by other reasonable means, to advise you about your Service or other matters we believe may be of interest to you. **We and our authorized agents may use any one or a combination of these methods of communication to convey important notices (for example, changes to this Agreement, to your Service, legal notices, etc.). You expressly consent on behalf of all the wireless lines on your account to all such methods of communication regarding your Service, whether active or inactive.**
    
    Email and text messages to your AT&T device are two of the primary methods that we use to contact you. The email address you provide at the time of ordering or Service activation is the email address we will use to communicate with you. You can update your email address through myAT&T, using the myAT&T app, or by calling Customer Care at 800.331.0500. **Notices from us to you are considered immediately delivered when we send them to your email address or by text message to your AT&T device.**
    
    Bill messages and inserts are another key way we share information with you. If you have online billing, those notices will be deemed received by you when your online bill is available for viewing. If you get a paper bill, those notices will be deemed received by you three days after we mail the bill to you. **Please do not overlook the important messages section of your bill.**
    

2.0 HOW DO I RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH AT&T? 2.1 Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration

**PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.**

Summary:

Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by calling our customer service department at 1-800-331-0500. **In the unlikely event that AT&T's customer service department is unable to resolve a complaint you may have to your satisfaction (or if AT&T has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.** Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. **Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis. class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.** For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $75,000, AT&T will pay all costs of the arbitration. Moreover, in arbitration you are entitled to recover attorneys' fees from AT&T to at least the same extent as you would be in court.

In addition, under certain circumstances (as explained below), AT&T will pay you more than the amount of the arbitrator's award and will pay your attorney (if any) twice his or her reasonable attorneys' fees if the arbitrator awards you an amount that is greater than what AT&T has offered you to settle the dispute.

2.2 Arbitration Agreement

1.  AT&T and you agree to arbitrate **all disputes and claims** between us. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:
    
    *   claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;
    *   claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);
    *   claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class. and
    *   claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.
    
    References to "AT&T," "you," and "us" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or Devices under this or prior Agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, including, for example, the Federal Communications Commission. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. **You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and AT&T are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.** This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.
    
2.  A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice to AT&T should be addressed to: Office for Dispute Resolution, AT&T, 1025 Lenox Park Blvd., Atlanta, GA 30319 ("Notice Address"). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute. and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). If AT&T and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or AT&T may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by AT&T or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or AT&T is entitled. You may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate arbitration at att.com/arbitration-forms.
3.  After AT&T receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $75,000. (The filing fee currently is $200 for claims under $10,000 but is subject to change by the arbitration provider. If you are unable to pay this fee, AT&T will pay it directly upon receiving a written request at the Notice Address.) The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. (You may obtain information that is designed for non-lawyers about the arbitration process at att.com/arbitration-information.) The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide. Unless AT&T and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. Except as otherwise provided for herein, AT&T will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse AT&T for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.
4.  If, after finding in your favor in any respect on the merits of your claim, the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of AT&T's last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, then AT&T will:
    
    *   pay you the amount of the award or $10,000 ("the alternative payment"), whichever is greater. and
    *   pay your attorney, if any, twice the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration ("the attorney premium").
    
    If AT&T did not make a written offer to settle the dispute before an arbitrator was selected, you and your attorney will be entitled to receive the alternative payment and the attorney premium, respectively, if the arbitrator awards you any relief on the merits. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.
    
5.  The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed in paragraph (4) supplements any right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law. Thus, if you would be entitled to a larger amount under the applicable law, this provision does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding you that amount. However, you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or costs. Although under some laws AT&T may have a right to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, AT&T agrees that it will not seek such an award.
6.  The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. **YOU AND AT&T AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.** Further, unless both you and AT&T agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.
7.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if AT&T makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) during your Service Commitment, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.

2.3 Puerto Rico Customers

For Puerto Rico customers, references to "small claims court" in sections 2.1 and 2.2 should be understood to mean the Puerto Rico Telecommunications Regulatory Board.

3.0 TERMS RELATING TO YOUR DEVICE AND CONTENT 3.1 Your Device

Your Device must be compatible with, and not interfere with, our Services and must comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. We may periodically program your Device remotely with system settings for roaming service, to direct your Device to use network services most appropriate for your typical usage, and other features that cannot be changed manually. Some device manufacturers will no longer pre-load certain applications into the device memory.

4.6 How Do I Get Service Outside AT&T's Wireless Network (Roaming)?

Services originated or received while outside your plan's included coverage area are subject to roaming charges. Domestic roaming charges for wireless data or voice Services may be charged with some plans when outside AT&T's wireless network. International roaming rates apply for any voice, messaging or data usage incurred outside the U.S.. Use of Services when roaming is dependent upon roaming carrier's support of applicable network technology and functionality. Display on your device may not indicate whether you will incur roaming charges. Check with roaming carriers individually for support and coverage details.

4.6.1 International Services

Certain eligibility restrictions apply which may be based on service tenure, payment history and/or credit. Rates are subject to change. For countries, rates and additional details, see att.com/global.

4.6.1.1 International Long Distance:

International rates apply for calls made and messages sent from the U.S. to another country. Calling or messaging to some countries may not be available. Calls to wireless numbers and numbers for special services, such as Premium Rated Services, may cost more than calls to wireline numbers. If a customer calls an overseas wireline number and the call is forwarded to a wireless number, the customer will be charged for a call terminated to a wireless number. International Long Distance calling rates are charged per minute and apply throughout the same footprint in which the customer's airtime package minutes apply.

4.6.1.2 International Long Distance Text, Picture &. Video Messaging:

Additional charges apply for premium messages and content. Messages over 300 KBs are billed an additional 50¢/message. For a complete list of countries, please visit att.com/text2world.

When roaming internationally, you will be charged international roaming airtime rates including when incoming calls are routed to voicemail, even if no message is left. Substantial charges may be incurred if Device is taken out of the U.S. even if no services are intentionally used. Billing for international roaming usage may be delayed up to three billing cycles due to reporting between carriers. Taxes are additional. If you want to block the ability to make and receive calls or use data functions while roaming internationally, you may request that by calling 1-314-925-6925 (at no charge from your wireless phone).

4.6.1.4 International Data:

International data rates apply to all data usage outside the U.S., including accessing cloud-based services to upload/download/stream content. International data roaming may be reduced to 2G speeds. Many Devices, including iPhone, transmit and receive data messages without user intervention and can generate unexpected charges when powered "on" outside the United States. AT&T may send "alerts" via SMS or email, to notify you of data usage. These are courtesy alerts. There is no guarantee you will receive them. They are not a guarantee of a particular bill limit. Receipt of Visual Voicemail messages are charged at international data pay-per-use rates unless customer has an international data plan/package, in which case receipt of Visual Voicemail messages decrement Kilobytes included in such plan/package.

Roaming charges do not apply when roaming within the Services area of land-based networks of the 50 United States. Additional charges may apply to Services used outside the land borders of the U.S..

5.2 Voicemail

Unless you subscribe to an Unlimited Voice Plan or are an upstate New York customer subscribing to Enhanced Voicemail, airtime charges apply to calls to your voicemail service, including calls where the caller does not leave a message, because the call has been completed, calls to listen to, send, reply to, or forward messages, or to perform other activities with your voicemail service, including calls forwarded from other phones to your voicemail service. You are solely responsible for establishing and maintaining security passwords to protect against unauthorized use of your voicemail service. For information as to the number of voicemail messages you can store, when voicemail messages will be deleted, and other voicemail features, see att.com/wirelessvoicemail. We reserve the right to change the number of voicemails you can store, the length you can store voicemail messages, when we delete voicemail messages, and other voicemail features without notice. We may deactivate your voicemail service if you do not initialize it within a reasonable period after activation. We will reactivate the service upon your request. See att.com/global for information about using voicemail internationally.

5.3 Voicemail-To-Text (VMTT)

AT&T is not responsible, nor liable for: 1) errors in the conversion of or its inability to transcribe voicemail messages to text/email. 2) lost or misdirected messages. or, 3) content that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, obscene, tortious, or otherwise objectionable.

We do not filter, edit or control voice, text, or email messages, or guarantee the security of messages. We can interrupt, restrict or terminate VMTT without notice, if your use of VMTT adversely impacts AT&T's network, for example that could occur from abnormal calling patterns or an unusually large number of repeated calls and messages. or if your use is otherwise abusive, fraudulent, or does not comply with the law.

You are solely responsible for and will comply with all applicable laws as to the content of any text messages or emails you receive from VMTT that you forward or include in a reply to any other person. You authorize AT&T or a third party working on AT&T's behalf to listen to, and transcribe all or part of a voicemail message and to convert such voicemail message into text/email, and to use voicemail messages and transcriptions to enhance, train and improve AT&T's speech recognition and transcription services, software and equipment.

Charges for VMTT include the conversion of the voicemail message and the text message sent to your wireless device. Additional charges, however, may apply to receiving email on your wireless device from VMTT, as well as, replying to or forwarding VMTT messages via SMS (text) or email, depending on your plan.

SMS (text messaging) blocking is incompatible with VMTT. (If you do not have a texting plan on your handset, we add a texting pay per use feature when you add VMTT with text delivery.) If you are traveling outside the U.S. coverage area, you will incur international data charges for emails received from VMTT, as well as, charges for emails you respond to or forward from VMTT, unless you have an international data plan and the usage falls within the plan's usage limits.

Transcription times cannot be guaranteed. Customers purchasing email delivery are responsible for providing a correct email address and updating the email address when changes to the email account are made.

If you choose SMS (text) delivery, VMTT only converts the first 480 characters of a voicemail message into text and you will receive up to three text messages of a transcribed message. The transcription, therefore, may not include the entire voicemail message with SMS delivery. Adding VMTT will create a new voicemail box and all messages and greetings will be deleted from your current voicemail box.

5.4 Unlimited Voice Services

Unlimited voice Services are provided primarily for reasonably uninterrupted live dialog between two individuals. If your use of unlimited voice Services for conference calling or call forwarding exceeds 750 minutes per month, AT&T may, at its option, terminate your Service or change your plan to one with no unlimited usage components.

AT&T may, in its sole discretion, terminate your Service or change your plan to one with no unlimited voice usage if it reasonably determines or has a reasonable basis to believe that you are engaged in any of the following prohibited activities: (1) maintaining an open line of communication to provide dispatch or monitoring services. (2) accessing or providing access to multi-party chat line services. (3) using the Service with a SIM box or SIM server network to generate or simulate voice calls. (4) transmitting broadcasts.

7.0 AT&T Wireless Home Services 7.1 AT&T Wireless Home Phone Service

AT&T Wireless Home Phone ("WHP") service utilizes mobile wireless gateway Equipment now called an AT&T Wireless Internet device ("WI Device", formerly called a Wireless Home Phone device or WHP Device). With WHP service, the WI Device allows you to connect a landline phone to place and receive calls over the AT&T wireless network. See Section 3.2 for more information about how AT&T wireless service works.

WHP service provides voice service only and requires that you subscribe to an eligible wireless voice plan option, such as: (1) Wireless Home Phone unlimited plan or (2) AT&T Mobile Share plan. If your WI Device is used to roam on other carrier networks, AT&T's off-net usage restrictions apply. Text messaging, data services, features and international roaming are not supported by WHP service. If you use a wireless voice plan not designed for WHP service with your WI Device, AT&T reserves the right to switch you to an appropriate plan and bill you the associated fees for such plan.

911 calls are routed based on the wireless network's automatic location technology. You should expect to provide your location address to the emergency response center responsible for sending first responders (e.g. police, medical assistance, or fire) to your location. The WI Device has battery backup power and will work in the event of a power outage. However, if you connect a landline phone to the WI Device that itself requires external electric power to operate (e.g., a cordless phone), you will not be able to place and receive calls over that phone during a power outage.

7.2 AT&T Wireless Internet Service

AT&T Wireless Internet service (formerly Wireless Home Phone and Internet service or WHPI) also utilizes the WI Device (the WHPI service used the Home Base device). With AT&T Wireless Internet service, the WI Device allows you to connect a landline phone to place and receive calls, and to connect up to eleven (11) Internet-capable devices (one (1) via Ethernet and ten (10) via Wi-Fi) to have mobile broadband Internet access over the AT&T wireless network. See Section 3.2 for more information about how AT&T wireless service works.

AT&T Wireless Internet service requires that you subscribe to an eligible wireless voice and/or data plan to take advantage of one or both capabilities. Tiered shared data plan options allow you to share a monthly allotment of domestic wireless data usage among your connected internet-capable devices. If your data usage exceeds the monthly data allotment of the plan you select during a billing period, you may automatically be charged for overages or your data may be slowed as specified in your plan. If you do not use all of the monthly data allotment of the plan you select during a billing period (or Rollover period, as applicable), you forfeit that usage. You may also add your WI Device to your AT&T Mobile Share plan if the monthly allotment of domestic wireless data usage under your AT&T Mobile Share plan is 10 GB or more, as well as select Mobile Share plans with 9 GB or more.

If your WI Device is used to roam on other carrier networks, AT&T's off-net usage restrictions apply. Messaging services and international roaming are not supported by AT&T Wireless Internet service. If you use a wireless voice and/or data plan not designed for AT&T Wireless Internet service with your WI Device, AT&T reserves the right to switch you to an appropriate plan and bill you the associated charges for such plan.

911 calls are routed based on the wireless network's automatic location technology. You should expect to provide your location address to the emergency response center responsible for sending first responders (e.g. police, medical assistance, or fire) to your location. The WI Device has battery backup power and will work in the event of a power outage. However, if you connect a landline phone to the WI Device that itself requires external electric power to operate (e.g., a cordless phone), you will not be able to place and receive calls over that phone during a power outage.
