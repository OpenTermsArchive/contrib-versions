About Monthly Payments
======================

*   This offer to enroll in an installment plan applies only to qualifying products where the "Monthly Payments" option is available on the product detail page or during checkout.
*   This offer may not be available to every customer and may not be available to you for all qualifying products. From time to time, and at Amazonâ€™s discretion, Monthly Payment offers may be available to you. Your eligibility for this offer is based on information relating to your Amazon.com account, such as your purchase history on Amazon.com, or the price of the qualifying Product or Device. We will not use a credit report to determine your eligibility. You acknowledge that your Monthly Payments purchase is for personal, family, or household purposes and not business purposes.
*   This offer applies to a limited number of qualifying products, and Amazon reserves the right to limit the number of Monthly Payments plans that you may have open at any one time.
*   This offer is not transferable and may not be combined with other offers.
*   We reserve the right to cancel this offer at any time.
*   You will be charged the full price of the qualifying product(s) you selected in one initial (down) payment and the corresponding number of subsequent monthly payments so that the total number of payments equals the number of payments in your Monthly Payments offer (provided that if the full price is not evenly divisible, your final payment amount may be smaller). Any applicable tax, shipping, and add-on charges will be due and assessed in full as part of your initial (down) payment when your item(s) ships. No interest or finance charges apply to this offer. Any interest, finance charges or fees assessed by the issuer of the payment method to which payments are charged may still apply. Taxes may apply in certain jurisdictions. An example of a payment schedule with five total payments is below. To see your payment schedule, please visit your [Manage Monthly Payments](https://www.amazon.com/manage-monthly-payments) page after your initial (down) payment is charged.

| Payment | Due Date |
| --- | --- |
| Initial (Down) Payment | Shipment Date |
| First Installment Payment | 30 Days from the Shipment Date |
| Second Installment Payment | 60 Days from the Shipment Date |
| Third Installment Payment | 90 Days from the Shipment Date |
| Fourth Installment Payment | 120 Days from the Shipment Date |

*   You authorize us to charge each payment to your selected payment method. If the selected method is unavailable (for example, a card has expired and cannot be charged successfully or funds are not available in that account), we will use another payment method we have on record for you. You agree to maintain in your Amazon.com account at least one valid credit card that expires no earlier than 20 days after your last payment due date.
*   You can choose to prepay either your next scheduled payment or the full remaining balance of your purchase at any time.
*   If we are not able to charge any payment to a payment method on file in your Amazon.com account we reserve the right to pursue any remedy that is available to us, including the right to suspend or terminate your Amazon.com account and, for Amazon devices purchased using Monthly Payments, the right to deregister your Amazon device, which will block your ability to access Amazon content and services from your device. You agree that we and our affiliates have no liability related to the exercise of these remedies.
*   This offer and your purchase, including any dispute or claim relating thereto, are subject to the terms in the [Amazon.com Conditions of Use](https://www.amazon.com/conditionsofuse), including the dispute resolution, governing law, disclaimer of warranties, and limitation of liability terms therein. Any return of a product purchased through this offer, and the amount of any resulting refund, will be subject to our [standard returns policy](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GKM69DUUYKQWKWX7). The remaining balance of your installment plan will be deducted from any refund.
*   With respect to Amazon devices, if you receive a replacement device from us under our limited warranty service, you are still responsible to pay the remaining balance owed on your purchase.
*   Void where prohibited.
*   **Monthly Payments plans with more than four installment payments are subject to the terms and conditions as set forth in the Monthly Payments Agreement. If you entered into a Monthly Payments Agreement your installment plan is governed by the terms and conditions in that agreement.**
