================================

Last updated: July 18, 2016

Welcome to the terms and conditions ("**Terms**") for Prime Student, which govern your Prime Student membership. Please note that your use of the Amazon.com Web site and the Prime Student membership are also governed by our [Conditions of Use](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=508088), [Privacy Notice](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=468496), [Amazon Prime Terms & Conditions](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=13819201), as well as all other applicable terms, conditions, limitations and requirements on the Amazon.com Web site.

Membership Benefits
-------------------

If you sign up for a Prime Student membership, you will receive certain Amazon Prime benefits at no cost for an initial period as indicated in the Prime Student program pages. There is no minimum purchase requirement. Unless you cancel, when the initial period expires you will automatically be entitled to receive full Amazon Prime benefits (except that you may not invite your household members to share your Prime membership) for the reduced rate specified in the [Prime Student](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201133670) section of our Help pages for a total benefit period (inclusive of your six month trial period) of up to four years. Benefits are subject to restrictions, such as geographic limitations, as stated on the Prime section of our Help pages. Unless you cancel, after you graduate or at the end of the fourth year of your Prime Student membership, whichever comes first, your subscription will automatically renew on its anniversary date into a full paid subscription for Amazon Prime at then-current rates. Prime Student members may also receive other benefits, such as discounts and promotions, which we will communicate to you via e-mail or make available on the Prime Student membership page at [www.amazon.com/student](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Student/b/ref=amb_link_409138702_5?ie=UTF8&node=668781011&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-3&pf_rd_r=1Z6BXY15AG1ZCX9280VR&pf_rd_t=1401&pf_rd_p=2016704022&pf_rd_i=1000522721). From time to time, we may choose in our sole discretion to add or remove Prime Student membership benefits.

Agreement Changes

YOUR CONTINUED MEMBERSHIP AFTER WE CHANGE THESE TERMS CONSTITUTES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE CHANGES. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ANY CHANGES, YOU MUST CANCEL YOUR MEMBERSHIP.

Termination by Us
-----------------

We may terminate your Prime Student membership at our discretion without notice. Failure to insist upon or enforce your strict compliance with these Terms will not constitute a waiver of any of our rights.
