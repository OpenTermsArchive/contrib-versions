*   This offer applies to one qualifying product in each product category or Amazon device family (as applicable) in your cart at time of checkout, and is limited to one active enrollment per product category or Amazon device family per customer. Fire tablets, Kindle e-readers, Amazon Fire TV, and Alexa-enabled devices (Amazon Echo, Echo Dot, and Amazon Tap) are each an "Amazon device family". Wireless products are an example of a "product category".

This offer may not be available to every customer and may not be available to you for all qualifying products. We reserve the right to consider for each transaction factors including your transaction history and past products purchased on Amazon.com and the nature and price of the qualifying product, in determining your eligibility for this offer. We will not use a credit report to determine your eligibility.

No interest or finance charges apply to this offer. Any interest, finance charges or fees assessed by the issuer of the payment method to which payments are charged may still apply. Taxes may apply in certain jurisdictions. Any applicable tax and shipping charges will be due and assessed in full as part of your initial payment when you check out. Your payment schedule is:

*   You authorize us to charge each payment to your preferred payment method. If the preferred method is unavailable (for example, a card has expired and cannot be charged successfully), we will use another payment method we have on record for you. You agree to maintain in your Amazon.com account at least one valid credit card that expires no earlier than 20 days after your last payment due date.

You agree that we and our affiliates have no liability related to the exercise of these remedies.
