Microsoft Privacy Statement
===========================

Last Updated: August 2018

Your privacy is important to us. This privacy statement explains the personal data Microsoft processes, how Microsoft processes it and for what purposes.

Microsoft offers a wide range of products, including server products used to help operate enterprises worldwide, devices you use in your home, software that students use at school, and services developers use to create and host what’s next. References to Microsoft products in this statement include Microsoft services, websites, apps, software, servers and devices.

Please read the product-specific details in this privacy statement, which provide additional relevant information. This statement applies to the interactions Microsoft has with you and the Microsoft products listed below, as well as other Microsoft products that display this statement.

  
Personal data we collect

Microsoft collects data from you, through our interactions with you and through our products. You provide some of this data directly, and we get some of it by collecting data about your interactions, use and experiences with our products. The data we collect depends on the context of your interactions with Microsoft and the choices that you make, including your privacy settings and the products and features that you use. We also obtain data about you from third parties.

If you represent an organisation, such as a business or educational institution, that utilises Enterprise and Developer Products from Microsoft, please see the [Enterprise and developer products](#mainenterprisedeveloperproductsmodule) section of this privacy statement to learn how we process your data.

You have choices when it comes to the technology you use and the data you share. When we ask you to provide personal data, you can decline. Many of our products require some personal data to provide you with a service. If you choose not to provide data necessary to provide you with a product or feature, you cannot use that product or feature. Likewise, where we need to collect personal data by law or to enter into or carry out a contract with you, and you do not provide the data, we will not be able to enter into the contract; or if this relates to an existing product you’re using, we may have to suspend or cancel it. We will notify you if this is the case at the time. Where providing the data is optional, and you choose not to share personal data, features like personalisation that use such data will not work for you.

Microsoft collects data from you, through our interactions with you and through our products for a variety of purposes described below, including to operate effectively and provide you with the best experiences with our products. You provide some of this data directly, such as when you create a Microsoft account, administer your organisation’s licensing account, submit a search query to Bing, register for a Microsoft event, speak a voice command to Cortana, upload a document to OneDrive, purchase an MSDN subscription, sign up for Office 365 or contact us for support. We get some of it by collecting data about your interactions, use and experience with our products and communications.

We rely on a variety of legal reasons and permissions (“legal bases”) to process data, including with your consent, a balancing of legitimate interests, necessity to enter into and perform contracts and compliance with legal obligations, for a variety of purposes described below.

We also obtain data from third parties. We protect data obtained from third parties according to the practices described in this statement, plus any additional restrictions imposed by the source of the data. These third-party sources vary over time and include:

*   Data brokers from which we purchase demographic data to supplement the data we collect.
*   Services that make user-generated content from their service available to others, such as local business reviews or public social media posts.
*   Communication services, including email providers and social networks, when you give us permission to access your data on such third-party services or networks.
*   Service providers that help us determine your device’s location.
*   Partners with which we offer co-branded services or engage in joint marketing activities.
*   Developers who create experiences for Microsoft products, such as Cortana.
*   Publicly available sources, such as open government databases.

If you represent an organisation, such as a business or educational institution, that utilises Enterprise and Developer Products from Microsoft, please see the [Enterprise and developer products](#mainenterprisedeveloperproductsmodule) section of this privacy statement to learn how we process your data.

You have choices when it comes to the technology you use and the data you share. When you are asked to provide personal data, you can decline. Many of our products require some personal data to operate and provide you with a service. If you choose not to provide data necessary to operate and provide you with a product or feature, you cannot use that product or feature. Likewise, where we need to collect personal data by law or to enter into or carry out a contract with you, and you do not provide the data, we will not be able to enter into the contract; or if this relates to an existing product you’re using, we may have to suspend or cancel it. We will notify you if this is the case at the time. Where providing the data is optional, and you choose not to share personal data, features like personalisation that use the data will not work for you.

**_The data we collect depends on the context of your interactions with Microsoft and the choices you make (including your privacy settings), the products and features you use, your location and applicable law_**.

The data we collect can include the following:

**Name and contact data**. Your first and surname, email address, postal address, phone number and other similar contact data.

**Credentials**. Passwords, password hints and similar security information used for authentication and account access.

**Demographic data**. Data about you such as your age, gender, country and preferred language.

**Payment data**. Data to process payments, such as your payment instrument number (such as a credit card number) and the security code associated with your payment instrument.

**Subscription and licensing data**. Information about your subscriptions, licences and other entitlements.

**Interactions**. Data about your use of Microsoft products. In some cases, such as search queries, this is data you provide in order to make use of the products. In other cases, such as error reports, this is data we generate. Other examples of interactions data include:

*   **Device and usage data**. Data about your device and the product and features you use, including information about your hardware and software, how our products perform, as well as your settings. For example:
    *   **Payment and account history**. Data about the items you purchase and activities associated with your account.
    *   **Browse history**. Data about the webpages you visit.
    *   **Device, connectivity and configuration data**. Data about your device, your device configuration and nearby networks. For example, data about the operating systems and other software installed on your device, including product keys. In addition, IP address, device identifiers (such as the IMEI number for phones), regional and language settings and information about WLAN access points near your device.
    *   **Error reports and performance data**. Data about the performance of the products and any problems you experience, including error reports. Error reports (sometimes called “crash dumps”) can include details of the software or hardware related to an error, contents of files opened when an error occurred and data about other software on your device.
    *   **Troubleshooting and help data**. Data you provide when you contact Microsoft for help, such as the products you use, and other details that help us provide support. For example, contact or authentication data, the content of your chats and other communications with Microsoft, data about the condition of your device and the products you use related to your help enquiry. When you contact us, such as for customer support, phone conversations or chat sessions with our representatives may be monitored and recorded.
*   **Interests and favourites**. Data about your interests and favourites, such as the sport teams you follow, the programming languages you prefer, the stocks you track or cities you add to track things like weather or traffic updates. In addition to those you explicitly provide, your interests and favourites can also be inferred or derived from other data we collect.
*   **Content consumption data**. Information about media content (e.g. TV, video, music, audio, text books, apps and games) you access through our products.
*   **Searches and commands**. Search queries and commands when you use Microsoft products with search or related productivity functionality.
*   **Voice data**. Your voice data, such as the search queries or commands you speak, which may include background sounds.
*   **Text, inking and typing data**. Text, inking and typing data and related information. For example, when we collect inking data, we collect information about the placement of your inking instrument on your device.
*   **Images**. Images and related information, such as picture metadata. For example, we collect the image you provide when you use a Bing image-enabled service.
*   **Contacts and relationships**. Data about your contacts and relationships if you use a product to share information with others, manage contacts, communicate with others or improve your productivity.
*   **Social data**. Information about your relationships and interactions between you, other people and organisations, such as types of engagement (e.g. likes, dislikes, events, etc.) related to people and organisations.
*   **Location data**. Data about your device’s location, which can be either precise or imprecise. For example, we collect location data using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) (e.g. GPS) and data about nearby mobile towers and Wi-Fi hotspots. Location can also be inferred from a device’s IP address or data in your account profile that indicates where it is located with less precision, such as at a city or postcode level.
*   **Other input**. Other inputs provided when you use our products. For example, data such as the buttons you press on an Xbox wireless controller using Xbox Live, skeletal tracking data when you use Kinect and other sensor data, like the number of steps that you take, when you use devices that have applicable sensors. And, if you use Spend, at your direction, we also collect financial transaction data from your credit card issuer to provide the service.

**Content**. Content of your files and communications you input, upload, receive, create and control. For example, if you transmit a file using Skype to another Skype user, we need to collect the content of that file to display it to you and the other user. If you receive an email using Outlook.com, we need to collect the content of that email to deliver it to your inbox, display it to you, enable you to reply to it and store it for you until you choose to delete it. Other content we collect when providing products to you include:

*   Communications, including audio, video, text (typed, inked, dictated or otherwise), in a message, email, call, meeting request or chat.
*   Photos, images, songs, films, software and other media or documents you store, retrieve or otherwise process with our cloud.

**Video or recordings**. Recordings of events and activities at Microsoft buildings, retail spaces and other locations. If you enter Microsoft Store locations or other facilities, or attend a Microsoft event that is recorded, we may process your image and voice data.

**Feedback and ratings**. Information you provide to us and the content of messages you send to us, such as feedback, survey data and product reviews you write.

Product-specific sections below describe data collection practices applicable to use of those products.

How we use personal data

Microsoft uses the data we collect to provide you with rich, interactive experiences. In particular, we use data to:

*   Provide our products, which includes updating, securing and troubleshooting, as well as providing support. It also includes sharing data, when it is required to provide the service or carry out the transactions you request.
*   Improve and develop our products.
*   Personalise our products and make recommendations.
*   Advertise and market to you, which includes sending promotional communications, targeting advertising and presenting you with relevant offers.

We also use the data to operate our business, which includes analysing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce and doing research.

In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two Microsoft products) or obtain from third parties to give you a more seamless, consistent and personalised experience, to make informed business decisions and for other legitimate purposes.

Microsoft uses the data we collect to provide you rich, interactive experiences. In particular, we use data to:

*   Provide our products, which includes updating, securing and troubleshooting, as well as providing support. It also includes sharing data, when it is required to provide the service or carry out the transactions you request.
*   Improve and develop our products.
*   Personalise our products and make recommendations.
*   Advertise and market to you, which includes sending promotional communications, targeting advertising and presenting you relevant offers.

We also use the data to operate our business, which includes analysing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce and doing research.

For these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two Microsoft products). For example, Cortana uses the favourite sports teams you add to the Microsoft Sports app to provide information relevant to your interests, and Microsoft Store uses information about the apps and services you use to make personalised app recommendations. However, we have built in technological and procedural safeguards designed to prevent certain data combinations where required by law. For example, where required by law, we store data we collect from you when you are unauthenticated (not signed in) separately from any account information that directly identifies you, such as your name, email address or phone number.

When we process personal data about you, we do so with your consent and/or as necessary to provide the products you use, operate our business, meet our contractual and legal obligations, protect the security of our systems and our customers, or fulfil other legitimate interests of Microsoft as described in this section and in the [Reasons we share personal data](#mainreasonswesharepersonaldatamodule) section of this privacy statement. When we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area, we do so based on a variety of legal mechanisms, as described in the [Where we store and process personal data](#mainwherewestoreandprocessdatamodule) section of this privacy statement.

**More on the purposes of processing:**

*   **Provide our products.** We use data to operate our products and provide you with rich, interactive experiences. For example, if you use OneDrive, we process the documents you upload to OneDrive to enable you to retrieve, delete, edit, forward or otherwise process it, at your direction as part of the service. Or, for example, if you enter a search query in the Bing search engine, we use that query to display search results to you. Additionally, as communications are a feature of various products, programmes and activities, we use data to contact you. For example, we may contact you by phone or email or other means to inform you when a subscription is ending or discuss your licensing account. We also communicate with you to secure our products, for example by letting you know when product updates are available.
*   **Product improvement.** We use data to continually improve our products, including adding new features or capabilities. For example, we use error reports to improve security features, search queries and clicks in Bing to improve the relevancy of the search results, usage data to determine what new features to prioritise and voice data to improve speech recognition accuracy.
*   **Personalisation.** Many products include personalised features, such as recommendations that enhance your productivity and enjoyment. These features use automated processes to tailor your product experiences based on the data we have about you, such as inferences we make about you and your use of the product, activities, interests and location. For example, depending on your settings, if you stream movies in a browser on your Windows device, you may see a recommendation for an app from the Microsoft Store that streams more efficiently. If you have a Microsoft account, with your permission, we can sync your settings on several devices. Many of our products provide controls to disable personalised features.
*   **Product activation.** We use data – such as device and application type, location and unique device, application, network and subscription identifiers – to activate products that require activation.
*   **Product development.** We use data to develop new products. For example, we use data, often de-identified, to better understand our customers’ computing and productivity needs which can shape the development of new products.
*   **Customer support.** We use data to troubleshoot and diagnose product problems, repair customers’ devices and provide other customer care and support services.
*   **Help secure and troubleshoot.** We use data to help secure and troubleshoot our products. This includes using data to protect the security and safety of our products and customers, detecting malware and malicious activities, troubleshooting performance and compatibility issues to help customers get the most out of their experiences, and notifying customers of updates to our products. This may include using automated systems to detect security and safety issues.
*   **Safety.** We use data to protect the safety of our products and our customers. Our security features and products can disrupt the operation of malicious software and notify users if malicious software is found on their devices. For example, some of our products, such as Outlook or OneDrive, systematically scan content in an automated manner to identify suspected spam, viruses, abusive actions or URLs that have been flagged as fraud, phishing or malware links; and we reserve the right to block delivery of a communication or remove content if it violates our terms.
*   **Updates.** We use data we collect to develop product updates and security patches. For example, we may use information about your device’s capabilities, such as available memory, to provide you a software update or security patch. Updates and patches are intended to maximise your experience with our products, help you protect the privacy and security of your data, provide new features and ensure that your device is ready to process such updates.
*   **Promotional communications.** We use data we collect to deliver promotional communications. You can sign up for email subscriptions and choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from Microsoft by email, SMS, physical mail and telephone. For information about managing your contact data, email subscriptions, and promotional communications, see the [How to access and control your personal data](#mainhowtoaccesscontrolyourdatamodule) section of this privacy statement.
*   **Relevant offers.** Microsoft uses data to provide you with relevant and valuable information regarding our products. We analyse data from a variety of sources to predict the information that will be most interesting and relevant to you and deliver such information to you in a variety of ways. For example, we may predict your interest in gaming and communicate with you about new games you may like.
*   **Advertising.** Microsoft does not use what you say in email, chat, video calls or voicemail, or your documents, photos or other personal files to target ads to you. We use data we collect through our interactions with you, through some of our products, and on third-party web properties, for advertising in our products and on third-party properties. We may use automated processes to help make advertising more relevant to you. For more information about how your data is used for advertising, see the [Advertising](#mainadvertisingmodule) section of this privacy statement.
*   **Transacting commerce.** We use data to carry out your transactions with us. For example, we process payment information to provide customers with product subscriptions and use contact information to deliver goods purchased from the Microsoft Store.
*   **Reporting and business operations.** We use data to analyse our operations and perform business intelligence. This enables us to make informed decisions and report on the performance of our business.
*   **Protecting rights and property.** We use data to detect and prevent fraud, resolve disputes, enforce agreements and protect our property. For example, we use data to confirm the validity of software licences to reduce piracy. We may use automated processes to detect and prevent activities that violate our rights and the rights of others, such as fraud.
*   **Legal compliance.** We process data to comply with law. For example, we use the age of our customers to ensure we meet our obligations to protect children’s privacy. We also process contact information and credentials to help customers exercise their data protection rights.
*   **Research.** With appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard individuals’ rights and freedoms, we use data to conduct research, including for public interest and scientific purposes.

Reasons we share personal data

We share your personal data with your consent or to complete any transaction or provide any product you have requested or authorised. We also share data with Microsoft-controlled affiliates and subsidiaries; with vendors working on our behalf; when required by law or to respond to legal process; to protect our customers; to protect lives; to maintain the security of our products; and to protect the rights and property of Microsoft and its customers.

We share your personal data with your consent or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any product you have requested or authorised. For example, we share your content with third parties when you tell us to do so, such as when you send an email to a friend, share photos and documents on OneDrive or link accounts with another service. When you provide payment data to make a purchase, we will share payment data with banks and other entities that process payment transactions or provide other financial services, and for fraud prevention and credit risk reduction.

In addition, we share personal data among Microsoft-controlled affiliates and subsidiaries. We also share personal data with vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this statement. For example, companies we've hired to provide customer service support or assist in protecting and securing our systems and services may need access to personal data to provide those functions. In such cases, these companies must abide by our data privacy and security requirements and are not allowed to use personal data they receive from us for any other purpose. We may also disclose personal data as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets.

Finally, we will retain, access, transfer, disclose and preserve personal data, including your content (such as the content of your emails in Outlook.com, or files in private folders on OneDrive), when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to do any of the following:

*   Comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or other government agencies.
*   Protect our customers, for example, to prevent spam or attempts to defraud users of our products, or to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury of anyone.
*   Operate and maintain the security of our products, including to prevent or stop an attack on our computer systems or networks.
*   Protect the rights or property of Microsoft, including enforcing the terms governing the use of the services – however, if we receive information indicating that someone is using our services to traffic in stolen intellectual or physical property of Microsoft, we will not inspect a customer's private content ourselves, but we may refer the matter to law enforcement.

For more information about data that we disclose in response to requests from law enforcement and other government agencies, please see our [Law Enforcement Requests Report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/about/corporate-responsibility/lerr/).

Please note that some of our products include links to products of third parties whose privacy practices differ from those of Microsoft. If you provide personal data to any of those products, your data is governed by their privacy policies.

How to access and control your personal data

You can also make choices about the collection and use of your data by Microsoft. You can control your personal data that Microsoft has obtained, and exercise your data protection rights, by contacting Microsoft or using various tools we provide. In some cases, your ability to access or control your personal data will be limited, as required or permitted by applicable law. How you can access or control your personal data will also depend on which products you use. For example, you can:

*   Control the use of your data for interest-based advertising from Microsoft by visiting our opt out page.
*   Choose whether you wish to receive promotional emails, SMS messages, telephone calls and post/mail from Microsoft.
*   Access and clear some of your data through the [Microsoft privacy dashboard](https://account.microsoft.com/privacy).

Not all personal data processed by Microsoft can be accessed or controlled via the tools above. If you want to access or control personal data processed by Microsoft that is not available via the tools above or directly through the Microsoft products you use, you can always contact Microsoft at the address in the [How to contact us](#mainhowtocontactusmodule) section or by using our [web form](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=321116).

You can access and control your personal data that Microsoft has obtained with tools Microsoft provides to you, which are described below, or by contacting Microsoft. For instance:

*   If Microsoft obtained your consent to use your personal data, you can withdraw that consent at any time.
*   You can request access to, erasure of and updates to your personal data.
*   If you’d like to port your data elsewhere, you can use tools Microsoft provides to do so, or if none are available, you can contact Microsoft for assistance.

You can also object to or restrict the use of your personal data by Microsoft. For example, you can object at any time to our use of your personal data:

*   For direct marketing purposes.
*   Where we are performing a task in the public interest or pursuing our legitimate interests or those of a third party.

You may have these rights under applicable laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), but we offer them regardless of your location. In some cases, your ability to access or control your personal data will be limited, as required or permitted by applicable law.

If your organisation, such as your employer, educational institution or service provider, provides you with access to and is administering your use of Microsoft products, contact your organisation to learn more about how to access and control your personal data.

You can access and control your personal data that Microsoft has obtained, and exercise your data protection rights, using various tools we provide. The tools most useful to you will depend on our interactions with you and your use of our products. Here is a general list of tools we provide to help you control your personal data; specific products may provide additional controls.

*   **Microsoft privacy dashboard**. You can control some of the data Microsoft processes through your use of a Microsoft account on the [Microsoft privacy dashboard](https://account.microsoft.com/privacy). From here, for example, you can view and clear the browsing, search and location data associated with your Microsoft account. You can also manage data in your Cortana Notebook and Microsoft Health services.
*   **Microsoft account**. If you wish to access, edit or remove the profile information and payment information in your Microsoft account, change your password, add security information or close your account, you can do so by visiting the [Microsoft account website](https://account.microsoft.com/).
*   **Volume Licensing Service Centre (VLSC)**. If you are a Volume Licensing customer, you can control your contact information and subscription and licensing data in one location by visiting the [Volume Licensing Service Centre website](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx).
*   **Skype**. If you wish to access, edit or remove profile and payment information in your account for Skype or change your password, [sign in to your account](https://login.skype.com/login).
*   **Xbox**. If you use Xbox Live or Xbox.com, you can view or edit your personal data, including billing and account information, privacy settings and online safety and data sharing preferences by accessing [My Xbox](http://live.xbox.com/MyXbox/Profile) on the Xbox console or on the Xbox.com website.
*   **Microsoft Store**. You can access your Microsoft Store profile and account information by visiting [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoftstore.com/) and selecting **View account** or **Order history**.
*   **Microsoft.com**. You can access and update your profile on microsoft.com by visiting your [Microsoft account profile page](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=317027).
*   If you have a **Microsoft Developer Network** (MSDN) public profile, you can access and edit your data by signing in at [MSDN forum](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/MSDNForum).

Not all personal data processed by Microsoft can be accessed or controlled via the tools above. If you want to access or control personal data processed by Microsoft that is not available via the tools above or directly through the Microsoft products you use, you can always contact Microsoft at the address in the [How to contact us](#mainhowtocontactusmodule) section or by using our [web form](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=321116). We will respond to requests to control your personal data within 30 days.

**Your communications preferences**

You can choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from Microsoft by email, SMS, postal mail and telephone. If you receive promotional email or SMS messages from us and would like to opt out, you can do so by following the directions in those messages. You can also make choices about the receipt of promotional email, telephone calls and post/mail by signing in with your personal Microsoft account, and viewing your [communication permissions](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=243191) where you can update contact information, manage Microsoft-wide contact preferences, opt out of email subscriptions and choose whether to share your contact information with Microsoft partners. If you do not have a personal Microsoft account, you can manage your Microsoft email contact preferences by using this [web form](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=243189). These choices do not apply to mandatory service communications that are part of certain Microsoft products, programs, activities or to surveys or other informational communications that have their own unsubscribe method.

**Your advertising choices**

To opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from Microsoft, visit our [opt-out page](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759). When you opt out, your preference is stored in a cookie that is specific to the web browser you are using. The opt-out cookie has an expiry date of five years. If you delete the cookies on your device, you need to opt out again.

You can also link your opt-out choice with your personal Microsoft account. It will then apply on any device where you use that account and will continue to apply until someone signs in with a different personal Microsoft account on that device. If you delete the cookies on your device, you will need to sign in again for the settings to apply.

For Microsoft-controlled advertising that appears in apps on Windows, you may use the opt-out linked to your personal Microsoft account, or opt out of interest-based advertising by turning off the advertising ID in Windows settings.

Because the data used for interest-based advertising is also used for other necessary purposes (including providing our products, analytics and fraud detection), opting out of interest-based advertising does not stop that data collection. You will continue to get ads, although they may be less relevant to you.

You can opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from third parties we partner with by visiting their sites (see above).

**Browser-based controls**

When you use a browser, you can control your personal data using certain features. For example:

*   **Cookie Controls**. You can control the data stored by cookies and withdraw consent to cookies by using the browser-based cookie controls described in the [Cookies](#maincookiessimilartechnologiesmodule) section of this privacy statement.
*   **Tracking protection**. You can control the data third-party sites can collect about you using Tracking Protection in Internet Explorer (versions 9 and up). This feature will block third-party content, including cookies, from any site that is listed in a Tracking Protection List you add.
*   **Browser controls for "Do Not Track".** Some browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites that you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, Microsoft services do not currently respond to browser DNT signals. We continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of how to treat DNT signals. In the meantime, you can use the range of other tools that we provide to control data collection and use, including the ability to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from Microsoft as described above.

Cookies and similar technologies

Cookies are small text files placed on your device to store data that can be recalled by a web server in the domain that placed the cookie. We use cookies and similar technologies for storing and honoring your preferences and settings, enabling you to sign in, providing interest-based advertising, combating fraud, analysing how our products perform and fulfilling other legitimate purposes. Microsoft apps use additional identifiers, such as the advertising ID in Windows described in the [Advertising ID](#mainadvertisingidmodule) section of this privacy statement, for similar purposes.

We also use “web beacons” to help deliver cookies and gather usage and performance data. Our websites may include web beacons, cookies or similar technologies from third-party service providers.

You have a variety of tools to control the data collected by cookies, web beacons and similar technologies. For example, you can use controls in your internet browser to limit how the websites you visit are able to use cookies and to withdraw your consent by clearing or blocking cookies.

Cookies are small text files placed on your device to store data that can be recalled by a web server in the domain that placed the cookie. This data often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your computer, but it can contain other information as well. Some cookies are placed by third parties acting on our behalf. We use cookies and similar technologies to store and honour your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, provide interest-based advertising, combat fraud, analyse how our products perform and fulfil other legitimate purposes described below. Microsoft apps use additional identifiers, such as the advertising ID in Windows, for similar purposes, and many of our websites and applications also contain web beacons or other similar technologies, as described below.

**Our use of cookies and similar technologies**

Microsoft uses cookies and similar technologies for several purposes, depending on the context or product, including:

*   **Storing your preferences and settings**. We use cookies to store your preferences and settings on your device, and to enhance your experiences. For example, if you enter your city or postcode to get local news or weather information on a Microsoft website, depending on your settings, we store that data in a cookie so that you will see the relevant local information when you return to the site. Saving your preferences with cookies, such as your preferred language, prevents you from having to set your preferences repeatedly. If you opt out of interest-based advertising, we store your opt-out preference in a cookie on your device.
*   **Sign-in and authentication**. We use cookies to authenticate you. When you sign in to a website using your personal Microsoft account, we store a unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your device. This cookie allows you to move from page to page within the site without having to sign in again on each page. You can also save your sign-in information so you do not have to sign in each time you return to the site.
*   **Security**. We use cookies to process information that helps us secure our products, as well as detect fraud and abuse.
*   **Storing information you provide to a website**. We use cookies to remember information you shared. When you provide information to Microsoft, such as when you add products to a shopping basket on Microsoft websites, we store the data in a cookie for the purpose of remembering the information.
*   **Social media**. Some of our websites include social media cookies, including those that enable users who are signed in to the social media service to share content via that service.
*   **Feedback**. Microsoft uses cookies to enable you to provide feedback on a website.
*   **Interest-based advertising**. Microsoft uses cookies to collect data about your online activity and identify your interests so that we can provide advertising that is most relevant to you. You can opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from Microsoft as described in the [How to access and control your personal data](#mainhowtoaccesscontrolyourdatamodule) section of this privacy statement.
*   **Showing advertising**. Microsoft uses cookies to record how many visitors have clicked on an advertisement and to record which advertisements you have seen, for example, so you don’t see the same one repeatedly.
*   **Analytics**. We use first- and third-party cookies and other identifiers to gather usage and performance data. For example, we use cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a web page or service and to develop other statistics about the operations of our products.
*   **Performance**. Microsoft uses cookies to understand and improve how our products perform. For example, we use cookies to gather data that helps with load balancing; this helps ensure that our websites remain up and running.

Some of the cookies we commonly use are listed below. This list is not exhaustive, but it is intended to illustrate the primary purposes for which we typically set cookies. If you visit one of our websites, the site will set some or all of the following cookies:

*   **MUID, MC1 and MSFPC.** Identifies unique web browsers visiting Microsoft sites. These cookies are used for advertising, site analytics and other operational purposes.
*   **ANON.** Contains the ANID, a unique identifier derived from your Microsoft account, which is used for advertising, personalisation and operational purposes. It is also used to preserve your choice to opt out of interest-based advertising from Microsoft if you have chosen to associate the opt-out with your Microsoft account.
*   **CC.** Contains a country code as determined from your IP address.
*   **PPAuth, MSPAuth, MSNRPSAuth, KievRPSAuth, WLSSC, MSPProf.** Helps to authenticate you when you sign in with your Microsoft account.
*   **MC0.** Detects whether cookies are enabled in the browser.
*   **MS0.** Identifies a specific session.
*   **NAP.** Contains an encrypted version of your country, postcode, age, gender, language and occupation, if known, based on your Microsoft account profile.
*   **MH.** Appears on co-branded sites where Microsoft is partnering with an advertiser. This cookie identifies the advertiser, so the right ad is selected.
*   **childinfo, kcdob, kcrelid, kcru, pcfm.** Contains information that Microsoft account uses within its pages in relation to child accounts.
*   **MR.** Used to collect information for analytics purposes.
*   **x-ms-gateway-slice.** Identifies a gateway for load balancing.
*   **TOptOut.** Records your decision not to receive interest-based advertising delivered by Microsoft.

In addition to the cookies Microsoft sets when you visit our websites, third parties can also set cookies when you visit Microsoft sites. For example:

*   Companies we hire to provide services on our behalf, such as site analytics, place cookies when you visit our sites. See opt out links below.
*   Companies that deliver content, such as videos or news, or ads on Microsoft sites, place cookies on their own. These companies use the data they process in accordance with their privacy policies, which may enable these companies to collect and combine information about your activities across websites, apps or online services.

**How to control cookies**

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but provide controls that allow you to block or delete them. For example, in Microsoft Edge, you can block or delete cookies by selecting **Settings > Privacy > Cookies**. Please refer to your browser's privacy or help documentation to find Instructions for blocking or deleting cookies in other browsers.

Certain features of Microsoft products depend on cookies. If you choose to block cookies, you cannot sign in or use some of those features, and preferences that are dependent on cookies will be lost. If you choose to delete cookies, any settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, are deleted and will need to be recreated.

Additional privacy controls that can impact cookies, including the Tracking Protection feature of Microsoft browsers, are described in the [How to access and control your personal data](#mainhowtoaccesscontrolyourdatamodule) section of this privacy statement.

**Our use of web beacons and analytics services**

Some Microsoft webpages contain electronic tags known as web beacons that we use to help deliver cookies on our websites, count users who have visited those websites and deliver co-branded products. We also include web beacons or similar technologies in our electronic communications to determine whether you open and act on them.

In addition to placing web beacons on our own websites, we sometimes work with other companies to place our web beacons on their websites or in their advertisements. This helps us develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement on a Microsoft website results in a purchase or other action on the advertiser's website.

Finally, Microsoft products often contain web beacons or similar technologies from third-party analytics providers, which help us compile aggregated statistics about the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other operations. These technologies enable the analytics providers to set or read their own cookies or other identifiers on your device, through which they can collect information about your online activities across applications, websites, or other products. However, we prohibit these analytics providers from using web beacons on our sites to collect or access information that directly identifies you (such as your name or email address). You can opt out of data collection or use by some of these analytics providers by clicking any of the following links: [Adjust](https://www.adjust.com/opt-out/), [AppsFlyer](https://www.appsflyer.com/optout), [Clicktale](http://www.clicktale.net/disable.html), [Flurry Analytics](https://aim.yahoo.com/aim/us/en/optout/), [Google Analytics](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) (requires you to install a browser add-on), [Kissmetrics](https://kissmetrics.com/user-privacy), [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/optout), [Nielsen](http://www.nielsen-online.com/corp.jsp?section=leg_prs&nav=1#Optoutchoices), [Visible Measures](https://www.visiblemeasures.com/viewer-settings-opt-out), or [WebTrends](https://ondemand.webtrends.com/support/optout.asp).

**Other similar technologies**

In addition to standard cookies and web beacons, our products can also use other similar technologies to store and read data files on your computer. This is typically done to maintain your preferences or to improve speed and performance by storing certain files locally. But, like standard cookies, these technologies can also store a unique identifier for your computer, which can then track behaviour. These technologies include Local Shared Objects (or “Flash cookies”) and Silverlight App Storage.

**Local Shared Objects or “Flash cookies”.** Websites that use Adobe Flash technologies can use Local Shared Objects or "Flash cookies" to store data on your computer. To learn how to manage or block Flash cookies, go to the [Flash Player help page](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html).

**Silverlight Application Storage**. Websites or applications that use Microsoft Silverlight technology also have the ability to store data by using Silverlight Application Storage. To learn how to manage or block such storage, see the [Silverlight](#mainsilverlightmodule) section of this privacy statement.

Products provided by your organisation – notice to end users

If you use an email address to access Microsoft products and that email address was provided by an organisation you are affiliated with, such as an employer or educational institution, that organisation can:

*   Control and administer your Microsoft product account.
*   Access and process your data, including the contents of your communications and files, associated with your Microsoft product accounts.

If you lose access to your work or educational institution account (in event of change of employment, for example), you may lose access to products and the content associated with those products, including those you acquired on your own behalf, if you used your work or educational institution account to sign in to such products.

Many Microsoft products are intended for use by organisations, such as schools and businesses. Please see the [Enterprise and developer products](#mainenterprisedeveloperproductsmodule) section of this privacy statement. If your organisation provides you with access to Microsoft products, your use of the Microsoft products is subject to your organisation's policies, if any. You should direct your privacy inquiries, including any requests to exercise your data protection rights, to your organisation’s administrator. When you use social features in Microsoft products, other users in your network may see some of your activity. To learn more about the social features and other functionality, please review documentation or help content specific to the Microsoft product. Microsoft is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of our customers, which may differ from those set forth in this privacy statement.

Microsoft account

With a Microsoft account, you can sign in to Microsoft products, as well as those of select Microsoft partners. Personal data associated with your Microsoft account includes credentials, name and contact data, payment data, device and usage data, your contacts, information about your activities, and your interests and favourites. Signing in to your Microsoft account enables personalisation and consistent experiences across products and devices, permits you to use cloud data storage, allows you to make payments using payment instruments stored in your Microsoft account, and enables other features.

There are three types of Microsoft account:

*   When you create your own Microsoft account tied to your personal email address, we refer to that account as a **personal Microsoft account**.
*   When you or your organisation (such as an employer or your school) create your Microsoft account tied to your email address provided by that organisation, we refer to that account as a **work or school account**.
*   When you or your service provider (such as a cable or Internet service provider) create your Microsoft account tied to your email address with your service provider’s domain, we refer to that account as a **third-party account**.

If you sign in to a service offered by a third party with your Microsoft account, you will share with that third party the account data required by that service.

With a Microsoft account, you can sign in to Microsoft products, as well as those of select Microsoft partners. Personal data associated with your Microsoft account includes credentials, name and contact data, payment data, device and usage data, your contacts, information about your activities, and your interests and favourites. Signing into your Microsoft account enables personalisation, consistent experiences across products and devices, permits you to use cloud data storage, allows you to make payments using payment instruments stored in your Microsoft account and enables other features. There are three types of Microsoft account:

*   When you create your own Microsoft account tied to your personal email address, we refer to that account as a **personal Microsoft account**.
*   When you or your organisation (such as an employer or your school) create your Microsoft account tied to your email address provided by that organisation, we refer to that account as a **work or school account**.
*   When you or your service provider (such as a cable or Internet service provider) create your Microsoft account tied to your email address with your service provider’s domain, we refer to that account as a **third-party account**.

**Personal Microsoft accounts**. The data associated with your personal Microsoft account, and how that data is used, depends on how you use the account.

*   **Creating your Microsoft account**. When you create a personal Microsoft account, you will be asked to provide certain personal data and we will assign a unique ID number to identify your account and associated information. While some products, such as those involving payment, require a real name, you can sign in to and use other Microsoft products without providing your real name. Some data you provide, such as your display name, email address and phone number, can be used to help others find and connect with you within Microsoft products. For example, people who know your display name, email address or phone number can use it to search for you on Skype and send you an invite to connect with them. Note that if you use a work or school email address to create a personal Microsoft account, your employer or school may gain access to your data. In some cases, you will need to change the email address to a personal email address in order to continue accessing consumer-oriented products (such as Xbox Live).
*   **Signing in to Microsoft account**. When you sign in to your Microsoft account, we create a record of your sign-in, which includes the date and time, information about the product you signed in to, your sign-in name, the unique number assigned to your account, a unique identifier assigned to your device, your IP address and your operating system and browser version.
*   **Signing in to Microsoft products**. Signing in to your account enables improved personalisation, provides seamless and consistent experiences across products and devices, permits you to access and use cloud data storage, allows you to make payments using payment instruments stored in your Microsoft account, and enables other enhanced features and settings. When you sign in to your account, you will stay signed in until you sign out. If you add your Microsoft account to a Windows device (version 8 or higher), Windows will automatically sign you in to products that use Microsoft account when you access those products on that device. When you are signed in, some products will display your name or username and your profile photo (if you have added one to your profile) as part of your use of Microsoft products, including in your communications, social interactions and public posts.
*   **Signing in to third-party products**. If you sign in to a third-party product with your Microsoft account, you will share data with the third party in accordance with the third party’s privacy policy. The third party will also receive the version number assigned to your account (a new version number is assigned each time you change your sign-in data); and information that describes whether your account has been deactivated. If you share your profile data, the third party can display your name or username and your profile photo (if you have added one to your profile) when you are signed in to that third-party product. If you chose to make payments to third-party merchants using your Microsoft account, Microsoft will pass information stored in your Microsoft account to the third party or its vendors (e.g. payment processors) as necessary to process your payment and fulfil your order (such as name, credit card number, billing and delivery addresses, and relevant contact information). The third party can use or share the data it receives when you sign in or make a purchase according to its own practices and policies. **You should carefully review the privacy statement for each product you sign in to and each merchant you purchase from to determine how it will use the data it collects.**

**Work or school accounts**. The data associated with a work or school account, and how it will be used, is generally similar to the use and collection of data associated with a personal Microsoft account.

If your employer or school uses Azure Active Directory (AAD) to manage the account it provides you, you can use your work or school account to sign in to Microsoft products, such as Office 365, and third-party products provided to you by your organisation. If required by your organisation, you will also be asked to provide a phone number or an alternative email address for additional security verification. And, if allowed by your organisation, you may also use your work or school account to sign in to Microsoft or third-party products that you acquire for yourself.

If you sign in to Microsoft products with a work or school account, note:

*   The owner of the domain associated with your email address may control and administer your account, and access and process your data, including the contents of your communications and files, including data stored in products provided to you by your organisation, and products you acquire by yourself.
*   Your use of the products is subject to your organisation’s policies, if any. You should consider both your organisation’s policies and whether you are comfortable enabling your organisation to access your data before you choose to use your work or educational institution account to sign in to products you acquire for yourself.
*   If you lose access to your work or school account (if you change employers, for example), you may lose access to products, including content associated with those products, you acquired on your own behalf if you used your work or school account to sign in to such products.
*   Microsoft is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of your organisation, which may differ from those of Microsoft.
*   If your organisation is administering your use of Microsoft products, please direct your privacy inquiries, including any requests to exercise your data subject rights, to your administrator. See also the [Notice to end users](#mainnoticetoendusersmodule) section of this privacy statement.

**Third-party accounts**. The data associated with a third-party Microsoft account, and how it will be used, is generally similar to the use and collection of data associated with a personal Microsoft account. Your service provider has control over your account, including the ability to access or delete your account. **You should carefully review the terms the third party provided you to understand what it can do with your account.**

Other important privacy information

Below you will find additional privacy information, such as how we secure your data, where we process your data, and how long we retain your data. You can find more information on Microsoft and our commitment to protecting your privacy at [Microsoft Privacy](https://privacy.microsoft.com/).

Security of personal data

Microsoft is committed to protecting the security of your personal data. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal data from unauthorised access, use or disclosure. For example, we store the personal data you provide on computer systems that have limited access and are in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential data (such as a credit card number or password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption. Microsoft complies with applicable data protection laws, including applicable security breach notification laws.

Where we store and process personal data

Personal data collected by Microsoft may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States, and in any other country where Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers operate facilities. Microsoft maintains major data centres in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, India, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Singapore, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States. Typically, the primary storage location is in the customer’s region or in the United States, often with a backup to a data centre in another region. The storage location(s) are chosen in order to operate efficiently, to improve performance and to create redundancies in order to protect the data in the event of an outage or other problem. We take steps to ensure that the data we collect under this privacy statement is processed according to the provisions of this statement and the requirements of applicable law wherever the data is located.

We transfer personal data from the European Economic Area and Switzerland to other countries, some of which have not yet been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection. For example, their laws may not guarantee you the same rights, or there may not be a privacy supervisory authority there that is capable of addressing your complaints. When we engage in such transfers, we use a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts, to help ensure your rights and protections travel with your data. To learn more about the European Commission’s decisions on the adequacy of the protection of personal data in the countries where Microsoft processes personal data, see this article on [the European Commission website](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en).

Microsoft Corporation complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States. Microsoft Corporation has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If third-party agents process personal data on our behalf in a manner inconsistent with the principles of either Privacy Shield framework, we remain liable unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. The controlled U.S. subsidiaries of Microsoft Corporation, as identified in our self-certification submission, also adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles – for more info, see the list of [Microsoft US entities or subsidiaries adhering to the Privacy Shield Principles](https://privacy.microsoft.com/entity-list-adhering-to-privacy-shield).

If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield programme, and to view our certification, visit the [Privacy Shield website](https://www.privacyshield.gov/).

If you have a question or complaint related to participation by Microsoft in the EU-US or Swiss-US Privacy Shield, we encourage you to contact us via our [web form](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=321116). For any complaints related to the Privacy Shield frameworks that Microsoft cannot resolve directly, we have chosen to cooperate with the relevant Data Protection Authority, or a panel established by the European data protection authorities for resolving disputes. Please contact us if you’d like us to direct you to your data protection authority contacts. As further explained in the Privacy Shield Principles, binding arbitration is available to address residual complaints not resolved by other means. Microsoft is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Our retention of personal data

Microsoft retains personal data for as long as necessary to provide the products and fulfill the transactions you have requested, or for other legitimate purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes and enforcing our agreements. Because these needs can vary for different data types, the context of our interactions with you or your use of products, actual retention periods can vary significantly.

Other criteria used to determine the retention periods include:

*   **Do customers provide, create or maintain the data with the expectation we will retain it until they affirmatively remove it?** Examples include a document you store in OneDrive, or an email message you keep in your Outlook.com inbox. In such cases, we would aim to maintain the data until you actively delete it, such as by moving an email from your Outlook.com inbox to the Deleted Items folder, and then emptying that folder (when your Deleted Items folder is emptied, those emptied items remain in our system for up to 30 days before final deletion). (Note that there may be other reasons why the data has to be deleted sooner, for example if you exceed limits on how much data can be stored in your account.)
*   **Is there an automated control, such as in the Microsoft privacy dashboard, that enables the customer to access and delete the personal data at any time?** If there is not, a shortened data retention time will generally be adopted.
*   **Is the personal data of a sensitive type?** If so, a shortened retention time would generally be adopted.
*   **Has Microsoft adopted and announced a specific retention period for a certain data type?** For example, for Bing search queries, we de-identify stored queries by removing the entirety of the IP address after 6 months, and cookie IDs and other cross-session identifiers after 18 months.
*   **Has the user provided consent for a longer retention period?** If so, we will retain data in accordance with your consent.
*   **Is Microsoft subject to a legal, contractual or similar obligation to retain or delete the data?** Examples can include mandatory data retention laws in the applicable jurisdiction, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation or data retained for the purposes of litigation. Conversely, if we are required by law to remove unlawful content, we will do so.

Advertising

Advertising allows us to provide, support and improve some of our products. Microsoft does not use what you say in email, chat, video calls or voicemail, or your documents, photos or other personal files to target ads to you. We use other data, detailed below, for advertising in our products and on third-party properties. For example:

*   Microsoft may use data we collect to select and deliver some of the ads you see on Microsoft web properties, such as Microsoft.com, MSN and Bing.
*   When the advertising ID is enabled in Windows 10 as part of your privacy settings, third parties can access and use the advertising ID (much the same way that websites can access and use a unique identifier stored in a cookie) to select and deliver ads in such apps.
*   We may share data we collect with third parties, such as Oath, AppNexus or Facebook (see below), so that the ads you see in our products, their products or other sites and apps serviced by these partners are more relevant and valuable to you.
*   Advertisers may choose to place our web beacons on their sites, or use similar technologies, in order to allow Microsoft to collect information on their sites such as activities, purchases and visits; we use this data on behalf of our advertising customers to provide ads.

The ads that you see may be selected based on data we process about you, such as your interests and favourites, your location, your transactions, how you use our products, your search queries or the content you view. For example, if you view content on MSN about automobiles, we may show advertisements about cars; if you search “pizza places in London” on Bing, you may see advertisements in your search results for restaurants in London.

The ads that you see may also be selected based on other information learned about you over time using demographic data, location data, search queries, interests and favourites, usage data from our products and sites, as well as the sites and apps of our advertisers and partners. We refer to these ads as "interest-based advertising" in this statement. For example, if you view gaming content on xbox.com, you may see offers for games on MSN. To provide interest-based advertising, we combine cookies placed on your device using information that we collect (such as IP address) when your browser interacts with our websites. If you opt out of receiving interest-based advertising, data associated with these cookies will not be used.

Further details regarding our advertising-related uses of data include:

*   **Advertising industry best practices and commitments**. Microsoft is a member of the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) (NAI) and adheres to the NAI Code of Conduct. We also adhere to the following self-regulatory programmes:
    *   In the US: [Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=304134)
    *   In Europe: [European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA)](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/)
    *   In Canada: [Ad Choices: Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (DAAC)](http://www.youradchoices.ca/)/ [Choix de Pub: l'Alliance de la publicité numérique du Canada (DAAC)](http://www.youradchoices.ca/fr)
*   **Health-related ad targeting**. In the United States, we provide interest-based advertising based on a limited number of standard, non-sensitive health-related interest categories, including allergies, arthritis, cholesterol, cold and flu, diabetes, gastrointestinal health, headache / migraine, healthy eating, healthy heart, men’s health, oral health, osteoporosis, skin health, sleep and vision / eye care. We will also target ads based on custom, non-sensitive health-related interest categories as requested by advertisers.
*   **Children and advertising**. We do not deliver interest-based advertising to children whose birthdate in their Microsoft account identifies them as under 16 years of age.
*   **Data retention**. For interest-based advertising, we retain data for no more than 13 months, unless we obtain your consent to retain the data longer.
*   **Data sharing**. In some cases, we share with advertisers reports about the data that we have collected on their sites or ads.

**Data collected by other advertising companies**. Advertisers sometimes include their own web beacons (or those of their other advertising partners) within their advertisements that we display, enabling them to set and read their own cookie. Additionally, Microsoft partners with third-party ad companies to help provide some of our advertising services, and we also allow other third-party ad companies to display advertisements on our sites. These third parties may place cookies on your computer and collect data about your online activities across websites or online services. These companies currently include, but are not limited to: [A9](http://www.a9.com/), [AppNexus](http://www.appnexus.com/), [Criteo](http://www.criteo.com/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217), [MediaMath](http://www.mediamath.com/), [nugg.adAG](http://ad-choices.nuggad.net/), [Oath](http://advertising.aol.com/), [Rocket Fuel](http://rocketfuel.com/), and [Yahoo!](http://advertising.yahoo.com/). Select any of the preceding links to find more information on each company's practices, including the choices it offers. Many of these companies are also members of the [NAI](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.aspx) or [DAA](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/), which each provide a simple way to opt out of ad targeting from participating companies.

Collection of data from children

When a Microsoft product collects age, and there is an age in your jurisdiction under which parental consent or authorisation is required to use the product, the product will either block users under that age or will ask them to provide consent or authorisation from a parent or guardian before they can use it. We will not knowingly ask children under that age to provide more data than is necessary to provide for the product.

Once parental consent or authorisation has been granted, the child's account will be treated much like any other account. The child can access communication services, like Outlook and Skype, and can freely communicate and share data with other users of all ages.

Parents can change or revoke the consent choices previously made, and review, edit or request the deletion of the personal data of children for whom they provided consent or authorisation. For example, parents can access their personal [Microsoft account](https://go.microsoft.com/FWLink/p/?LinkID=238657) and select **Permissions**. For users of Minecraft for PC/Java and other Mojang games, parents can visit the [Mojang Account page](https://account.mojang.com/terms#contact).

Preview or free-of-charge releases

Microsoft offers preview, insider, beta or other free-of-charge products and features ("previews") to enable you to evaluate them while providing Microsoft with data about your use of the product, including feedback and device and usage data. As a result, previews can automatically collect additional data, provide fewer controls, and otherwise employ different privacy and security measures than those typically present in our products. If you participate in previews, we may contact you about your feedback or your interest in continuing to use the product after general release.

Changes to this privacy statement

We update this privacy statement when necessary to provide greater transparency or in response to:

*   Feedback from customer, regulators, industry or other stakeholders.
*   Changes in our products.
*   Changes in our data processing activities or policies.

When we post changes to this statement, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of the statement and describe the changes on the [Change history](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=780766) page. If there are material changes to the statement, such as a change to the purposes of processing of personal data that is not consistent with the purpose for which it was originally collected, we will notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes before they take effect or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to periodically review this privacy statement to learn how Microsoft is protecting your information.

Productivity and communications products

Productivity and communications products are applications, software and services you can use to create, store and share documents, as well as communicate with others.

Skype

Skype lets you send and receive voice, video and instant message communications. This section applies to the consumer version of Skype; if you are using Skype for Business, see the [Enterprise and developer products](#mainenterpriseservicesmodule) section of this privacy statement.

As part of providing these features, Microsoft collects usage data about your communications that includes the time and date of the communication and the numbers or usernames that are part of the communication.

**Skype profile**. To enable other people to find you on Skype (or products that interact with Skype, such as Skype for Business), depending on your profile settings, your Skype profile is included in the Skype public search directory and may be recommended to other users. Your profile includes your username, avatar and any other data you choose to add to your profile or display to others.

**Skype Contacts**. If you use a Microsoft service, such as Outlook.com, to manage contacts, Skype will automatically add the people you know to your Skype contact list until you tell us to stop. With your permission, Skype will also check your device or other address books from time to time to automatically add your friends as Skype contacts. You can block users if you don’t want to receive their communications.

**Partner companies**. To make Skype available to more people, we partner with other companies to allow Skype to be offered via those companies’ services. If you use Skype through a company other than Microsoft, that company’s privacy policy governs how it handles your data. To comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, or to help our partner company or local operator comply or respond, we may access, transfer, disclose and preserve your data. That data could include, for example, your private content, such as the content of your instant messages, stored video messages, voicemails or file transfers.

**Skype Manager**. Skype Manager lets you manage a group’s (such as your family’s) Skype usage from one central place. When you set up a group, you will be the Skype Manager Administrator and can see the patterns of usage, including detailed information such as traffic data and details of purchases made by other members of the group who have consented to such access. If you add information such as your name, other people in the group will be able to see it. Members of the group can withdraw consent for Skype Manager by visiting their [Skype account page](https://login.skype.com/login).

**Push notifications**. To let you know of incoming calls, chats and other messages, Skype apps use the notification service on your device. For many devices, these services are provided by another company. To tell you who is calling, for example, or to give you the first few words of the new chat, Skype has to tell the notification service so that they can provide the notification to you. The company providing the notification service on your device will use this information in accordance with their own terms and privacy policy. Microsoft is not responsible for the data collected by the company providing the notification service. If you don’t want to use the notification services for incoming Skype calls and messages, turn it off in the settings found in the Skype application or your device.

**Skype advertising**. Some Skype software includes interest-based advertising, so that you’re more likely to see ads you’ll like. In some versions of the software, you can opt out of interest-based advertising in the privacy options or account settings menu. If you sign in to Skype with a Microsoft account, you can opt out of interest-based advertising on the [Microsoft privacy dashboard](https://account.microsoft.com/privacy). If you opt out, you’ll still see ads displayed in the Skype software based on your country of residence, language preference and IP address location, but other data is not used for ad targeting.

**Translation features**. To help you communicate with people in different languages, some Skype apps offer audio and/or text translation features. When you use translation features, your voice and text data are used to provide and improve Microsoft speech recognition and translation services.

**Recording features**. Some versions of Skype have a recording feature that allows you to capture and share all or part of your audio/video call. The recording will be stored and shared as part of your conversation history with the person or group with whom the call occurred. **You should understand your legal responsibilities before recording any communication. This includes whether you need to get consent from all parties to the communication in advance**. Microsoft is not responsible for how you use your recordings or the recording features.

**Skype bots**. Bots are programs offered by Microsoft or third parties that can do many useful things like search for news, play games and more. Depending on their capabilities, bots may have access to your display name, Skype ID, country, region, language and any messages, audio, video or content that you share with the bot. Please review the bot profile and its privacy statement before engaging in a one-to-one or group conversation with a bot. You can delete a bot that you no longer wish to engage with. Prior to adding a bot to a group, please ensure that your group participants have consented to their information being shared with the bot.

**Cortana in Skype**. Subject to availability, you can use Cortana in Skype to help manage your time and tasks, find information and get things done using Microsoft and third-party services. Cortana works best when you give her permission to use data, such as your location and IM conversations from Skype to personalise experiences across Microsoft products that offer Cortana functionality. If you choose not to give permission, Cortana may still provide you with non-personalised suggestions and responses within Skype.

Microsoft Health services

Microsoft Health services can help you understand and manage your health data. They include HealthVault, HealthVault Insights, Microsoft Band devices, other Microsoft Health applications and related products. The Band helps you keep track of data like heart rate and steps taken. The Band can also use Cortana to take notes and receive notifications from your phone. The Microsoft Health applications send data to Microsoft servers and allow you to view, manage and control the data. The applications may enable notifications to the Band and other devices. HealthVault services let you gather, edit, add to and store health data online, and share your health data with family, caregivers, and health care professionals.

Microsoft Health services collect and use your data to provide the services, which includes improving and personalising your experiences. Health data you provide to Microsoft through Microsoft Health services is not combined with data from other Microsoft services, or used for other purposes without your explicit consent. For example, Microsoft does not use your health record data to market or advertise to you without your opt-in consent.

Health services

Microsoft Health services can help you understand and manage your health data. The data collected depends on the services and features you use, and includes the following:

*   **Profile data**. When you create a profile, you provide data, such as height, weight and age that is used to calculate your activity results. Other profile data comes from your personal Microsoft account.
*   **Activity and fitness data**. Microsoft Health services help you keep track of your activity and fitness by collecting data like your heart rate, steps, calories burned and sleep. Examples of types of activities you can choose to track are runs, workouts and sleep.
*   **Usage data**. To provide you with the best service, we collect and automatically upload statistics about the performance and your use of the Microsoft Health services.
*   **Location**. Microsoft Band has built-in Global Positioning System (GPS) capabilities, which let you map your activities like running or biking, without having to carry your phone with you. If you enable GPS for an activity, you can view the activity map in the Microsoft Health applications. Some modes on the Band, such as Golf and Explorer, automatically turn on GPS, and turn it off when you end the mode. 

To learn more about the Band's sensors and the data they collect, see the [Microsoft Band page on the Microsoft Support website](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-band/support/hardware/sensors).

**Access and control**. You can view and manage your data in Microsoft Health services. For example, you can view and update your profile data, manage connected applications and view past activities. You can delete specific activity details in the Microsoft Health services. When you delete a specific activity, the event is deleted from the Microsoft Health services; however, other data and the basic sensor data captured by the devices remain in the Microsoft Health services. You can cancel your Microsoft Health services account at any time by contacting Customer Support from the [Microsoft Band website](http://aka.ms/w6r45e).

**Cortana**. The Microsoft Health services allow you to use Cortana. When you use Cortana, data you process in the Microsoft Health services, including health-related data and data processed from third-party services, is shared with Cortana. Cortana’s capabilities allow you to perform queries and set reminders with your voice, if Cortana is enabled on your device. To learn more about how Cortana manages your data, see the [Cortana](#maincortanamodule) section of this privacy statement.

HealthVault

HealthVault is a personal health platform that lets you gather, edit, store and share health data online. With HealthVault, you can control your own health records. You can also choose to share your health data with family, caregivers, health care professionals, mobile applications, health-related devices and online tools. For more information about HealthVault, visit the [HealthVault Help page](http://aka.ms/kr4ndl).

**Signing in to HealthVault**. To sign in to HealthVault, you can use Microsoft account or third-party authentication services. If you close your Microsoft account or lose your account credentials, you may not be able to access your data. You can use more than one credential with HealthVault to help ensure continued access. Before using a third-party authentication service with HealthVault, we recommend you review the security and privacy commitments offered by the issuer.

**HealthVault account and Health records**. To create a new HealthVault account, you must provide personal data such as name, date of birth, email address, postcode and country/region. Depending on which features you use, you may be asked for additional information. A HealthVault account allows you to manage one or more health records, such as the ones you create for yourself and your family members. You can add or remove data to a health record you manage at any time.

In the US, HealthVault assigns each health record a unique HealthVault email address. When a message is received at that email address, the message and attachments are automatically added to the HealthVault record, and a notification email is sent to the custodians of that record. The email service in HealthVault uses "Direct", a protocol designed specifically to communicate with health care providers. For that reason, HealthVault email can only be sent and received with providers that use a system that uses the Direct protocol. Custodians can add or disable record email addresses.

**Sharing health data**. A key value of HealthVault is the ability you have to share your health data with people and services that can help you meet your health-related goals. By default, you are the custodian of any records that you create. Custodians have the highest level of access to a health record. As a custodian, you can share data in a health record with another person by sending an e-mail invitation through HealthVault. You can specify what type of access they have (including custodian access), how long they have access and whether they can modify the data in the record. When you grant someone access, that person can grant the same level of access to someone else (for example, someone with view-only access can grant another user view-only access). **Because inappropriate granting of access could allow someone to violate your privacy or even revoke your access to your own records, you should be cautious about granting access to your records.**

You can choose to share specific data (or all of the data) in a health record with other services, including participating third-party services that you authorise. No service has access to your data through HealthVault unless an authorised user grants it access through HealthVault. HealthVault allows you to control access by accepting or denying requests. For each service granted access, you choose what health information in a specific health record to share and what actions each service may perform on the health information.

A service you authorise for a record will get the full name associated with your HealthVault account, the nickname of the authorised record(s) and your relationship to that record. The service will continue to have access through HealthVault until you revoke the permission. Microsoft can revoke a service's access to HealthVault if it does not meet its privacy commitments to Microsoft. However, except for applying the access permissions you have granted to third-party services, we do not control or monitor third-party services, and their privacy practices will vary.

**Reports to US health care providers**. In the United States, we enable participating health care providers to obtain reports about whether the information they send to a record in Microsoft Health services is used. This feature supports the "meaningful use" objective of the HITECH Act, which provides incentives for health care providers to send their patients copies of their medical information electronically. Providers that participate can get reports that include a number the provider uses to identify the patient within its system, and whether the user took one of the "qualifying actions" in HealthVault (but no information about which action). "Qualifying action" currently includes activities such as viewing, downloading, or transmitting health information via email. You can turn off reporting for your records.

**Access and controls**. You can review, edit or delete your HealthVault account data, or close your HealthVault account at any time. Only custodians can permanently delete an item. When you delete a heath record, it is deleted from all users who had access to it.

When you close your HealthVault account, we delete all records for which you are the sole custodian. If you share custodian access for a record, you can decide whether to delete the record. Microsoft will wait a limited amount of time before permanently deleting your data in order to help avoid accidental or malicious removal of your health data.

HealthVault maintains a full history of each access, change or deletion by users and services, which includes the date, action and name of the person or service. Custodians of records can examine the history of those records.

**Email communications**. We will use the email address you provide when you create your HealthVault account to send you an email requesting that you validate your email address, to include in sharing invitations you send through HealthVault, and to send you service notifications, such as email notifications that information is available to add to your HealthVault records.

HealthVault periodically sends newsletters to help keep you informed of the latest improvements. HealthVault will also periodically send you an email summarising recent account activity. Subject to your contact preferences, we also use your email addresses to send you promotional email. You can unsubscribe from these emails at any time.
