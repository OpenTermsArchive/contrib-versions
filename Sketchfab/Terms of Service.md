For the different types of licenses and details thereof, please see the [License Agreement](https://sketchfab.com/licenses).

### 11\. Applicable law and jurisdiction; Arbitration

**11.1 Applicable law and jurisdiction.** The Services are primarily operated by Sketchfab from its offices in the United States and France. Access to the Services from jurisdictions where such access is illegal is prohibited. All matters arising from or relating to this Agreement and the use and operation of the Services shall be governed by the substantive laws of the state of North Carolina, USA, without regard to its conflicts of laws principles, except to the extent the privacy laws of other jurisdictions govern our treatment personal information as described in our [Privacy Policy](https://sketchfab.com/privacy). Without derogation of the obligation to arbitrate set forth in **Section 11.2** below, you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA. If you are accessing the Services from locations outside the United States, including the European Union, you will be responsible for compliance with all local laws of any such other location, and in no event will you use the Services or User Content in violation of US or EU export laws or regulations.

**11.2 Arbitration.** All disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Services shall be resolved exclusively by binding arbitration before a single arbitrator (the "Arbitrator") in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA") then in effect and the further procedures set forth herein. (For information on the AAA and its rules, see [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/ "American Arbitration Association").) The arbitration shall be conducted in Raleigh, North Carolina, unless the Arbitrator shall determine that that venue is not reasonably convenient to all parties, in which case the Arbitrator shall determine another venue that is. In the event that the AAA is unavailable or unwilling to administer the arbitration, and the parties are unable to agree to a substitute, a substitute shall be appointed by the court. The Arbitrator shall have authority to issue any and all remedies authorized by law. The arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 2 et seq. Notwithstanding any rules of the AAA to the contrary, any claims shall be adjudicated on an individual basis only, and ALL USERS WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO BRING ANY CLAIM AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF A PROPOSED CLASS, ON AN AGGREGATED OR MASS BASIS, OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR TO CONSOLIDATE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES THERETO. Any award rendered by the Arbitrator shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto. In connection with any arbitration proceeding pursuant to these terms and conditions, unless the Arbitrator shall determine otherwise, each party shall bear its own costs and expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sketchfab shall have the right to commence and prosecute any legal or equitable action or proceeding before any court of competent jurisdiction to obtain injunctive or other relief against you in the event that, in the opinion of Sketchfab, such action is necessary or desirable. Also notwithstanding the foregoing, a User may at their option file an individual claim in any small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of its subject matter jurisdiction if such court has personal jurisdiction. Sketchfab does not hereby waive any defense that such jurisdiction may be lacking in the User's jurisdiction.

**11.3 Class Action Wavier.** To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to only bring disputes in an individual capacity and shall not: seek to bring, join, or participate in any class or representative action, collective or class-wide arbitration, or any other action where another individual or entity acts in a representative capacity (e.g., private attorney general actions); or consolidate or combine individual proceedings or permit an arbitrator to do so without the express consent of Sketchfab and all parties to all other actions or arbitrations.

### 12\. Amendment

### 13\. Miscellaneous

This Agreement represents the entire agreement between Sketchfab and the User with respect to the provision of the Services, and all prior representations and understandings, whether written or oral, are excluded. No delay or omission by Sketchfab in exercising any of its rights occurring upon any noncompliance or default by any User with respect to any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement will impair any such right or be construed to be a waiver thereof, and a waiver by Sketchfab of any of the covenants, conditions or terms to be performed by a User will not be construed to be a waiver of any succeeding breach thereof or of any other covenant, condition or terms hereof contained. As used in this Agreement, "including" means "including but not limited to." If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, then the Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will be reformed to be valid and enforceable while reflecting the intent of the parties to the greatest extent permitted by law. You shall not assign or transfer this Agreement or any right or obligation hereunder to any third party. Sketchfab may freely assign this Agreement, including to any purchase of Sketchfab, Inc. and/or its business operations.

You consent to receive communications from us electronically, and you agree that we may communicate with you by email or by posting notices on the Services. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that we provide to you, or that you provide to us, electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.

### 14\. Artificial Intelligence

(a) Identifying where User Content should not be used with Generative AI Programs

We care about protecting creators and providing the tools to protect their creations. You are able to tag your projects containing your User Content with "NoAI" if you would like such content to be prohibited from use with AI. This tag will not be applied to your uploads or your User Content by default; you must actively designate your projects containing your User Content for the "NoAI" tag to apply. Any User Content that has been tagged, labeled, or otherwise marked "NoAI" via the functionality provided by the platform will be known as "NoAI Content."

For purposes of this Agreement, "Generative AI Programs" means artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, neural networks, or similar technologies designed to automate the generation of or aid in the creation of new content, including but not limited to audio, visual, or text-based content. You shall not collect, aggregate, mine, scrape, or otherwise use NoAI Content (i) in datasets utilized by Generative AI Programs; (ii) in the development of Generative AI Programs; or (iii) as inputs to Generative AI Programs.

Sketchfab agrees, whether or not your User Content is NoAI Content, that it will not use your User Content or license your User Content to third parties for use (i) in datasets utilized by Generative AI Programs; (ii) in the development of Generative AI Programs; or (iii) as inputs to Generative AI Programs.

(b) Identifying where User Content is created with Generative AI Programs.

If you make User Content available under a license that permits other users to redistribute that content (including as part of a larger work) and such User Content is created using Generative AI Programs, you must tag such User Content using the "CreatedWithAI" tag. Any content uploaded to the Services that has been tagged, labeled, or otherwise marked "CreatedWithAI" via the functionality provided by the platform will be known as "CreatedWithAI Content." Sketchfab will not apply the "CreatedWithAI" tag to User Content; you are solely responsible for complying with the requirement to tag your User Content.

Under this Agreement, User Content is considered to be created using Generative AI Programs where a material portion of User Content is generated with Generative AI Programs, whether characters, backgrounds, or other material elements. User Content is not considered to be created using Generative AI Programs merely for use of features that solely operate on content (e.g., content-aware fill) or that don’t introduce material Generative AI elements into your work (e.g. AI based image upscaling).

The effective date of these Terms of Use is March 23, 2023.
