iChat Account Terms of Service 1. You must agree to these Terms of Service to use the iChat Service

The following Terms of Service (“TOS”) are between you and Apple (“Apple”, “we” or “us”) and constitute a legal agreement that governs your use of the iChat account and service (collectively, the “Service”). These TOS govern your use of the Service, which you access by signing in with a screen name or other credential (“Screen Name”) issued by us. You can agree to these TOS by: a) registering a Screen Name with us and using the Service, or b) clicking a box that indicates you agree to the Service, where such a box is made available to you. If you are an existing iChat user who registered for the Service through .Mac and are no longer a .Mac subscriber, these TOS supersede and replace the prior .Mac terms regarding your ongoing use of the Service. If you are an existing MobileMe subscriber, these TOS supplement the MobileMe TOS. You must be legally competent to agree to these TOS. If you do not agree to any of the following terms, please do not use the Service. You should print or otherwise save a copy of these TOS for your records. "Apple" as used herein means Apple Inc., located at 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, California and, where applicable, Apple Distribution International, Hollyhill Industrial Estate, Hollyhill, Cork, Ireland.

2\. Changes to these Terms of Service

Apple may update or change these TOS at any time and recommends that you review the TOS on a regular basis. You understand and agree that your continued use of the Service after the TOS has changed constitutes your acceptance of the TOS as revised. Without limiting the foregoing, if Apple makes a change to the TOS that materially impacts your use of the Service, Apple may provide prior notice of any such change in its sole discretion.

3\. Registration

Upon completing the registration information for your iChat account, you may select or we will assign to you a Screen Name and you will be required to select a password. Please choose a strong password and do not reveal your password to others. You agree that you are responsible for keeping your password confidential and secure, and further understand that you are solely responsible and liable for any activities that occur under your iChat account and Screen Name. You agree that all information you provide to Apple during the registration process will be complete and accurate information. You shall keep this information up to date while using the Service.

4\. Inactive Status

You must use your Screen Name on a regular basis in order to keep it active. We reserve the right to deactivate any Screen Name that has been inactive for more than ninety (90) days. This rule does not apply to any Screen Names that are associated with a MobileMe account that is in good standing. If your Screen Name is not tied to an active MobileMe account you must use it regularly by logging in and out of the Service in order to keep your registration active. If we deactivate a Screen Name, we have the right to reassign it to another user.
