Key Updates

WhatsApp Updated Terms Of Service And Privacy Policy

**Our Updated Terms and Privacy Policy.** Our updated Terms of Service explains our agreement with you to use our Services. Our updated Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use and share it, and the choices you have, including how to manage your privacy settings, access the information we have about you, and delete your account. We build WhatsApp with strong privacy and security principles, like end-to-end encryption of your messages and calls, which means we and third parties can't read or listen to them. Here are some important points:

**WhatsApp Ireland.** WhatsApp Ireland Limited provides our Services and is responsible for your information when you use WhatsApp.

**Age Requirement.** To use WhatsApp, you must be at least 16 years old.

**How WhatsApp Works With The Other Facebook Companies.** WhatsApp is one of the Facebook Companies. WhatsApp works and shares information with the other Facebook Companies to receive services like infrastructure, technology, and systems that help us provide and improve WhatsApp and to keep WhatsApp and the Facebook Companies safe and secure. When we receive services from the Facebook Companies, the information we share with them is used to help WhatsApp in accordance with our instructions. Working together allows us to:

*   Provide you fast and reliable messaging and calls around the world and understand how our services and features are performing.
*   Ensure safety and security across WhatsApp and the Facebook Company Products by removing spam accounts and combatting abusive activity.
*   Connect your WhatsApp experience with Facebook Company Products. For example, you could share a link to a post from Facebook to a WhatsApp chat.
*   Enable you to communicate with businesses on WhatsApp. For example, if you visit a business's Facebook page, you might see a button that lets you easily open a WhatsApp chat with them.

Nothing you share on WhatsApp, including your messages, photos, and account information, will be shared onto Facebook or any of our other family of apps for others to see, and nothing you post on those apps will be shared on WhatsApp for others to see, unless you choose to do so.

Today, Facebook does not use your WhatsApp account information to improve your Facebook product experiences or provide you more relevant Facebook ad experiences on Facebook. Learn more about how WhatsApp works with the Facebook Companies.

We're always working on new ways to improve how you experience WhatsApp and the other Facebook Company Products you use. We'll keep you updated on new experiences we offer and our information practices.

**New Ways To Use WhatsApp.** We offer new features like improvements to group chats and video calling. We're continuing to build ways for you to communicate with businesses, and you'll be able to manage these communications.

**Infrastructure And Systems.** Our Privacy Policy also explains how we use infrastructure, systems, and service providers around the world, and that we transfer information outside of the European Economic Area. Learn More

Special Arbitration Provision For United States Or Canada Users

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT CONTAINS ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE ONLY TO OUR UNITED STATES AND CANADA USERS. IF YOU ARE A WHATSAPP USER LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES OR CANADA, YOU AND WE AGREE TO SUBMIT ALL DISPUTES TO BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, EXCEPT FOR THOSE THAT INVOLVE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DISPUTES AND EXCEPT THOSE THAT CAN BE BROUGHT IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. THIS MEANS YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE SUCH DISPUTES RESOLVED IN COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY. THIS SECTION ALSO LIMITS THE TIME YOU HAVE TO BRING A CLAIM, INCLUDING THE TIME TO START AN ARBITRATION OR, IF PERMISSIBLE, A COURT ACTION. FINALLY, YOU MAY BRING A CLAIM ONLY ON YOUR OWN BEHALF, AND NOT ON BEHALF OF ANY OFFICIAL OR OTHER PERSON, OR CLASS OF PEOPLE. YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN, OR HAVE YOUR DISPUTE HEARD AND RESOLVED AS, A CLASS ACTION, A CLASS ARBITRATION, OR A REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.

"Excluded Dispute" means any Dispute relating to the enforcement or infringement of your or our intellectual property rights (such as copyrights, trademarks, domains, logos, trade dress, trade secrets, and patents). For clarity and notwithstanding the foregoing, those Disputes relating to, arising out of, or in any way in connection with your rights of privacy and publicity are not Excluded Disputes.

**Federal Arbitration Act.** The United States Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this "Special Arbitration Provision for United States or Canada Users" section, including any question whether a Dispute between WhatsApp and you is subject to arbitration.

**Agreement To Arbitrate For WhatsApp Users Located In The United States Or Canada.** For WhatsApp users who live in the United States or Canada, WhatsApp and you each agree to waive the right to a trial by judge or jury for all Disputes, except for the Excluded Disputes. WhatsApp and you agree that all Disputes (except for the Excluded Disputes), including those relating to, arising out of, or in any way in connection with your rights of privacy and publicity, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration. WhatsApp and you agree not to combine a Dispute that is subject to arbitration under our Terms with a Dispute that is not eligible for arbitration under our Terms.

The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is started, including the Optional Rules for Emergency Measures of Protection and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (together, the "AAA Rules"). The arbitration will be presided over by a single arbitrator selected in accordance with the AAA Rules. The AAA Rules, information regarding initiating a Dispute, and a description of the arbitration process are available at www.adr.org. The arbitrator will decide whether a Dispute can be arbitrated. The location of the arbitration and the allocation of fees and costs for such arbitration shall be determined in accordance with the AAA Rules.

**Opt-Out Procedure.** You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither we nor you can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify us in writing postmarked within 30 days of the later of: (i) the date that you first accepted our Terms. and (ii) the date you became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out:

WhatsApp Inc.  
Arbitration Opt-Out  
1601 Willow Road  
Menlo Park, California 94025  
United States of America

You must include: (i) your name and residence address. (ii) the mobile phone number associated with your account. and (iii) a clear statement that you want to opt out of our Terms' agreement to arbitrate.

**Small Claims Court.** As an alternative to arbitration, if permitted by your local "small claims" court's rules, you may bring your Dispute in your local "small claims" court, as long as the matter advances on an individual (non-class) basis.

**Time Limit To Bring Claim.** We and you agree that for any Dispute (except for the Excluded Disputes) we and you must bring claims (including commencing an arbitration proceeding) within one year after the Dispute first arose. otherwise, such Dispute is permanently barred. This means that if we or you do not bring a claim (including commencing an arbitration) within one year after the Dispute first arose, then the claim will be dismissed because it was started too late.

**No Class Actions, Class Arbitrations, Or Representative Actions For Users Located In The United States Or Canada.** We and you each agree that if you are a WhatsApp user located in the United States or Canada, each of we and you may bring Disputes against the other only on its or your own behalf, and not on behalf of any other person or entity, or any class of people. We and you each agree not to participate in a class action, a class-wide arbitration, Disputes brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated Disputes involving any other person or entity in connection with any Dispute.

**Severability.** If the prohibition against class actions and other Disputes brought on behalf of third parties is found to be unenforceable for a Dispute, then all of the provisions above under the caption "Special Arbitration Provision for United States or Canada Users" will be null and void as to that Dispute.

**Place To File Permitted Court Actions.** If you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, if your Dispute is an Excluded Dispute, or if the arbitration agreement is found to be unenforceable, you agree to be subject to the applicable provision in the "Dispute Resolution" section set forth above.

Accessing WhatsApp's Terms in Different Languages

WhatsApp Privacy Policy Last modified: April 24, 2018 (archived versions)

Respect for your privacy is coded into our DNA. Since we started WhatsApp, we've aspired to build our Services with a set of strong privacy principles in mind.

If you live in a country in the European Economic Area (which includes the European Union), and any other included country or territory (collectively referred to as the European Region), your Services are provided by WhatsApp Ireland Limited ("WhatsApp Ireland"), which is also the data controller responsible for your information when you use our Services.

If you live in any other country, except those in the European Region, your Services are provided by WhatsApp Inc., which is also your data controller responsible for your information when you use our Services.

We are part of the Facebook Companies. Our Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") helps explain our information (including message) practices, including the information we process to support our Services. For example, we talk about what information we collect and how this affects you. We also explain the steps we take to protect your privacy - like building WhatsApp so delivered messages aren't stored and giving you control over who you communicate with on our Services.

This Privacy Policy applies to all of our Services unless specified otherwise.

Please also read WhatsApp's Terms of Service ("Terms"), which describes the terms under which you use our Services.

Information We Collect

WhatsApp must receive or collect some information to operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services, including when you install, access, or use our Services. The types of information we receive and collect depend on how you use our Services.

**Information You Provide**

*   **Your Account Information.** You provide your mobile phone number and basic information (including a profile name) to create a WhatsApp account. You provide us, all in accordance with applicable laws, the phone numbers in your mobile address book on a regular basis, including those of both the users of our Services and your other contacts. You may provide us an email address. You may also add other information to your account, such as a profile picture and about information.
    
*   **Your Messages.** We do not retain your messages in the ordinary course of providing our Services to you. Once your messages (including your chats, photos, videos, voice messages, files, and share location information) are delivered, they are deleted from our servers. Your messages are stored on your own device. If a message cannot be delivered immediately (for example, if you are offline), we may keep it on our servers for up to 30 days as we try to deliver it. If a message is still undelivered after 30 days, we delete it. To improve performance and deliver media messages more efficiently, such as when many people are sharing a popular photo or video, we may retain that content on our servers for a longer period of time.
