19.  ### GOVERNING LAW; YOUR OBLIGATIONS TO US
    
    Our goal is to resolve any disputes amicably and quickly and we encourage you to contact us and explain your complaint as soon as it arises. This section is not intended to limit your rights as a consumer or your right to bring an action in your country of residence, to the extent such rights cannot be changed by this Agreement.
    
    1.  **Governing Law.** This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree that any claim or dispute you may have against Zoosk must be resolved in a federal or state court located in Santa Clara County, California, USA or as described in the Arbitration provision below. Both you and Zoosk retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that Santa Clara County, California, USA is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or in the event that the Arbitration provision below is for any reason held to be unenforceable. For users whose first registration for the Services occurred after December 5, 2018, this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of Ireland and we each agree that the courts of Ireland will have non-exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute arising under, or in connection with, this Agreement. 
    2.  **Arbitration.** READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM ZOOSK. For any dispute with Zoosk, you agree to first contact us within 30 days of when the dispute arises at legal@zoosk.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Zoosk has not been able to informally resolve a dispute it has with you within 60 days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief described in Section 19(a)) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration by the Judicial Mediation and Arbitration Services (“JAMS”) under the JAMS Optional Expedited Procedures then in effect, except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at [www.jamsadr.com](http://www.jamsadr.com/). You will have the right to participate in the selection of the arbitrator, who may be selected by mutual agreement of the parties or by the procedures provided by JAMS if the parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator. Unless the parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator shall be an attorney licensed to practice in the location where the arbitration proceedings will be conducted or a retired federal or state judicial officer who presided in the jurisdiction where the arbitration will be conducted. The arbitration will be conducted in Santa Clara County, California, USA, (or the nearest office to Santa Clara County), unless you request a hearing in your hometown area or you and Zoosk agree otherwise. The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings will be English, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. You will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing fees in accordance with JAMS rules. The award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorneys’ fees and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of that party’s data security, intellectual property rights, or other proprietary rights. You may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process.If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Zoosk submit to the arbitrator and, if requested by either party or the arbitrator, a telephonic hearing.
    3.  **CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER.** YOU AND ZOOSK AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND ZOOSK ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
    4.  **Severability.** If any clause within this Section 19 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this section and the remainder of the section will be given full force and effect, except that in the event of unenforceability of the universal Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver, the entire arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable.
    5.  Except to the extent Zoosk is in breach of the terms of this Agreement, you shall be responsible for any losses, expenses or other costs incurred by Zoosk, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and each of their directors, officers, managers, agents, contractors, partners and employees due to or arising from
        1.  your use of or access to the Services, including any data or content transmitted or received by you, or your inability to use the Services;
        2.  any claim or damages that arise as a result of any of your User Content or any User Content that is submitted via your account that is in breach of this Agreement, our policies or any Additional Terms;
        3.  your conduct in connection with the Services or our users that is in breach of this Agreement, our policies or any Additional Terms;
        4.  your violation of any of the terms of this Agreement, including without limitation your breach of any of the statements you have agreed to in this Agreement;
        5.  your violation of any rights of a third party, including without limitation any right of privacy or intellectual property rights;
        6.  any other party’s access and use of the Services with your unique username, password or other appropriate security code; or
        7.  your violation of any applicable laws, rules or regulations.
