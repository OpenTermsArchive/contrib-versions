**TERMS OF SERVICE**

Please read these terms carefully and keep a copy of them for your reference. Please also note that there may be specific terms or conditions applicable to you as a user in a given jurisdiction, as detailed below.

Please refer to our Privacy Policy, available at [link](https://solana.com/privacy-policy), for information about how we collect, use, share and otherwise process information about you.

**AGREEMENT TO TERMS**

This End User License Agreement and Terms of Service (“_EULA_” or “_Terms_”) is a binding contract between you, an individual user or site visitor, whether personally or on behalf of an entity (“_user_,” “_you_,” “_your_”) and the Solana Foundation (the “_Foundation_,” “_we_,” “_us_” or “_our_”) concerning use of the Foundation’s services (the “_Service_”), including the www.solana.com website as well as any other media form, media channel, or mobile website related, linked, or otherwise connected thereto (collectively, the “_Site_”). Currently, the Foundation maintains and operates [www.solana.com](http://www.solana.com/) as a portal for news, information, and updates about the Solana protocol or blockchain (the “Solana Network”) and the Solana ecosystem. For the avoidance of doubt, the Foundation does not control the Solana Network and cannot control activity and data on the Solana Network, the activities of persons who develop and use applications on the Network, the validation of transactions on the Solana Network, or use of the Solana Network. Solana The Network is an open-source protocol that is maintained and processed by Solana Network validators across the globe.

BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE EULA. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SERVICE OR SITE.

It is your responsibility to periodically review the EULA to stay informed of updates.

The information provided on the Site is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Site from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.

The Service is intended for users who are at least 18 years old. You agree that by using the Site and the Service you are at least 18 years of age, or accessing the Service under the supervision of a parent or guardian, and you are legally able to enter into a contract. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a user under the age of 18 (or the age of legal majority), you agree to be fully responsible for the acts or omissions of such user in relation to the Service. If you use the Service on behalf of another person or entity, (a) all references to “you” throughout the EULA will include that person or entity, (b) you represent that you are authorized to accept these Terms on that person’s or entity’s behalf, and (c) in the event you or the person or entity violates these Terms, the person or entity agrees to be responsible to us.

PLEASE NOTE: THE “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” SECTION OF THIS EULA CONTAINS AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE THAT REQUIRES DISPUTES TO BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND PROHIBITS CLASS ACTION CLAIMS. IT AFFECTS HOW DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND THE FOUNDATION ARE RESOLVED. BY ACCEPTING THIS EULA, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY.

All other trademarks, registered trademarks, product names and company names or logos mentioned on the Service are the property of their respective owners. Reference to any products, services, processes or other information by trade name, trademark, manufacturer, supplier or otherwise does not constitute or imply endorsement, sponsorship or recommendation by us.

**DISPUTE RESOLUTION**

**Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with the Foundation and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration provision.** In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial. \*\*

(a) **No Representative Actions. You and the Foundation agree that any dispute arising out of or related to this EULA or the Service is personal to you and the Foundation and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.**

(b) **Arbitration of Disputes. You and the Foundation** **waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any other dispute arising out of or related to this EULA and the Service, including claims related to privacy and data security, (collectively, “_Disputes_”) resolved in court**. Instead, for any Dispute that you have against the Foundation you agree to first contact the Foundation and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim (“_Notice_”) to the Foundation by email at [operations@solana.foundation](mailto:operations@solana.foundation) or by certified mail addressed to Dammstrasse 16, 6300 Zug, Switzerland. The Notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the Dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above. If you and the Foundation cannot reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the Dispute to binding arbitration administered by JAMS or, under the limited circumstances set forth above, in court. All Disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in Zug, Switzerland. You and the Foundation agree that Disputes will be held in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“_JAMS Rules_”). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on the [_JAMS website_](https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/) and are hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.

(c) You and the Foundation agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, _et seq_. (the “_FAA_”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.

(d) The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute. The arbitrator, the Foundation, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the Dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.

(e) You and the Foundation agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee (up to a maximum of \\$250 if you are a consumer), and the Foundation will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by the Foundation, the Foundation will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and the Foundation agree that the Kanton of Zug shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. \[\]{#h.lnxbz9 .anchor}

(f) **Any Dispute must be filed within one year after the relevant claim arose; otherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred, which means that you and the Foundation will not have the right to assert the claim.** \[\]{#h.35nkun2 .anchor}

(g) **You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section by mailing an opt-out notice to the Foundation at Dammstrasse 16, 6300 Zug, Switzerland**. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with the governing law and venue terms of this EULA.

(h) If any portion of this Section is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section; and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section will be enforceable.

**GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE**

Any dispute arising from these Terms and your use of the Service will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Switzerland. Any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration will be resolved in Zug, Switzerland.

IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE THAT YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY SHALL BE FOR YOU TO DISCONTINUE YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.

You may have other rights which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
