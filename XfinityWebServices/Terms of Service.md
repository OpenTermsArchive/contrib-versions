THE ARBITRATION PROVISION REQUIRES THAT DISPUTES BE RESOLVED IN INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT PROCEEDINGS. IN ARBITRATION, THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY AND THERE IS LESS DISCOVERY AND APPELLATE REVIEW THAN IN COURT.**

Certain Comcast Web Services allow you to access content and information, such as collections of data, video, audio, or other multimedia, and photographs and other static images (the "**Content**"). This Content may be owned by Comcast, other companies that give Comcast the right to distribute their Content (like movie publishers), or users of the Comcast Web Services (like you). Comcast grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-assignable license to view the Content and to use the Comcast Web Services for personal, non-commercial purposes as set forth in these Terms or in a manner that does not require a license. Except for activities that do not require a license, unless the Content was legally posted by you on the Comcast Web Services, you may not distribute copies of the Content in any form (including by email or other electronic means), without prior written permission from its owner. Of course, you are free to encourage others to access the Content and to tell them how to find it.

In addition, our Content providers want to remind you that you must not remove, alter, interfere with, or circumvent any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices marked on the Content or any digital rights management mechanism, device, or other content protection or access control measure associated with the Content. The copying, downloading, stream capturing, reproduction, duplication, archiving, distribution, uploading, publication, modification, translation, broadcast, performance, display, sale, or transmission of the Content is strictly prohibited unless it is expressly permitted by Comcast in writing or is an activity that does not require a license. You may not incorporate the Content into any hardware or software application. This prohibition applies even if you intend to give away the derivative materials free of charge.

You understand that by using the Comcast Web Services you may be exposed to Content that you may find offensive, indecent or objectionable. In this respect, you use the Comcast Web Services at your own risk. If you would like to use them, there are commercially available services and software that can limit exposure to material that you may find objectionable. The XFINITY Internet service provides security information and tools for all users, including parents, at http://constantguard.xfinity.com. Some of the tools may require that you be a registered XFINITY Internet user in order to download and use them. Other tools may require that you purchase a separate license to use them.

If you find a change in the Comcast Web Services unacceptable, you have the right to cancel your Comcast Web Services account or to stop using the Comcast Web Services. However, if you continue to use the Comcast Web Services after the change, this will constitute your acceptance of the change.

You represent and warrant that you own the content or otherwise have sufficient rights in it to grant to Comcast the license set forth in this section without infringing or violating the rights of any third party. If you remove content that you have posted to the Comcast Web Services or terminate your Comcast Web Services account, this license will automatically expire, with a few limited exceptions. Comcast may retain copies of your content that were archived in the normal course of Comcast's systems operations. In addition, copies of content that you have shared with other users of the Comcast Web Services may be retained by Comcast and associated with those other users' accounts in order to provide them with the Comcast Web Services.

Comcast may refuse to display or remove any user submission from the Comcast Web Services for any reason in our sole discretion.

16\. Copyright Infringement

Comcast is committed to complying with U.S. copyright and related laws, and requires all users of the Comcast Web Services to comply with these laws. Accordingly, you may not use the Comcast Web Services to store any material or content, or disseminate any material or content, in any manner that constitutes an infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including rights granted by U.S. copyright law.

If you are the owner of a copyrighted work and believe your rights under U.S. copyright law have been infringed by any material on the Comcast Web Services, you may take advantage of certain provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the "DMCA") by sending Comcast's authorized agent a notification of claimed infringement that satisfies the requirements of the DMCA. Upon Comcast's receipt of a satisfactory notice of claimed infringement, Comcast will respond expeditiously either directly or indirectly (i) to remove the allegedly infringing work(s) from the Comcast Web Services or (ii) to disable access to the work(s). In accordance with the DMCA, it is Comcast's policy to reserve the right to terminate access to the Comcast Web Services (or any part of those services) for any user who is either found to infringe third-party copyright or other intellectual property rights, including repeat infringers, or who Comcast, in its sole discretion, believes is infringing these rights. Comcast may terminate access to the Comcast Web Services at any time with or without notice for any affected customer or user. If the affected user believes in good faith that the allegedly infringing works have been removed or blocked by mistake or misidentification, then that person may send a counter notification to Comcast. Upon Comcast's receipt of a counter notification that satisfies the requirements of DMCA, Comcast will provide a copy of the counter notification to the person who sent the original notification of claimed infringement and will follow the DMCA's procedures with respect to a received counter notification. In all events, you expressly agree that Comcast will not be a party to any disputes or lawsuits regarding alleged copyright infringement.

Copyright owners may send Comcast a notification of claimed infringement to report alleged infringements of their works to:

Comcast Cable Communications Management, LLC

Attn: General Counsel/Comcast Web Services DMCA Notice

One Comcast Center

Philadelphia, PA 19103

DMCA\_Notice@Comcast.com

1-888-565-4329

Any notification of claimed infringement must be in a form that satisfies the requirements of Section 512(c)(3) of the U.S. Copyright Act. Under the DMCA, anyone who knowingly makes misrepresentations regarding alleged copyright infringement may be liable to Comcast, the alleged infringer, and the affected copyright owner for any damages incurred in connection with the removal, blocking, or replacement of allegedly infringing material.

If a notification of claimed infringement has been filed against you, you can file a counter notification with Comcast's designated agent using the contact information shown above. All counter notifications must satisfy the requirements of Section 512(g)(3) of the U.S. Copyright Act.

If the parties cannot agree, the parties shall mutually petition a court of appropriate jurisdiction to appoint an arbitration organization that will administer a proceeding under this Arbitration Provision as written applying the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules. A single arbitrator will resolve the Dispute. Unless you and Comcast agree otherwise, any arbitration hearing will take place at a location convenient to you in the area where you receive or received any of the Web Services from Comcast. or, if you reside in a location outside of the area where you receive or received any of the Web Services, then the arbitration hearing will take place at a location convenient to you in the county where you reside. The arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized by law and will take reasonable steps to protect customer account information and other confidential or proprietary information. The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision that explains the arbitrator’s essential findings and conclusions. The arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties only if necessary for purposes of enforcing the arbitrator’s award. An arbitrator’s award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court.

**g. Waiver of Class Actions and Collective Relief.** THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY CLAIMS TO BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON A CLASS ACTION, JOINT OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS OR ON BASES INVOLVING CLAIMS BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC (SUCH AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL), OTHER SUBSCRIBERS, OR OTHER PERSONS. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT INDIVIDUAL PARTY’S CLAIM. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT AWARD RELIEF FOR OR AGAINST ANYONE WHO IS NOT A PARTY. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS AND COLLECTIVE RELIEF IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION AND CANNOT BE SEVERED FROM IT. THE REMAINING PORTIONS OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION ARE NOT ESSENTIAL PARTS OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION AND CAN BE SEVERED FROM IT BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION.

**h. Arbitration Fees and Costs.** If your claim seeks more than $75,000 in the aggregate, the payment of the AAA’s fees and costs will be governed by the AAA rules. If your claims seek less than $75,000 in the aggregate, the payment of the AAA’s fees and costs will be Comcast’s responsibility. However, if the arbitrator finds that your Dispute was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), the payment of the AAA’s fees and costs shall be governed by the AAA Rules and you shall reimburse Comcast for all fees and costs that were your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. You may hire an attorney to represent you in arbitration. You are responsible for your attorneys’ fees and additional costs and may only recover your attorneys’ fees and costs in the arbitration to the extent that you could in court if the arbitration is decided in your favor. Notwithstanding anything in this Arbitration Provision to the contrary, Comcast will pay all fees and costs that it is required by law to pay.

**i. Continuation.** This Arbitration Provision will survive the termination or expiration of these Terms.

Modifications, Suspension, and Termination

You understand that Comcast may modify or discontinue the Email Service at any time with or without notice to you. If we do give you notice, it may be provided on any of the Comcast Services, or via email, newspaper, or any other permissible communication.

Comcast's anti-spam approach is explained in the FAQs under the topic "What is Comcast doing about spam?" located here.

Comcast is not responsible for deleting or forwarding any email sent to the wrong email address by you or by someone else trying to send email to you. Comcast is also not responsible for forwarding email sent to any Email Service account that has been suspended or terminated. This email will be returned to the sender, ignored, deleted, or stored temporarily at Comcast's sole discretion. If you cancel or terminate your Email Service account for any reason, all email associated with that account (and any secondary accounts) will be permanently deleted as well.

If Comcast believes in its sole discretion that any subscriber name, account name, or email address (collectively, an "**Identifier**") on the Email Service may be used for, or is being used for, any misleading, fraudulent, or other improper or illegal purpose, Comcast (i) reserves the right to block access to and prevent the use of any of these Identifiers and (ii) may at any time require any customer to change his or her Identifier. In addition, Comcast may at any time reserve any identifiers on the Email Service for its own purposes.
