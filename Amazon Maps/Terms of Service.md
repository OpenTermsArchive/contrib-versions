You should always remain aware of your surroundings and exercise good judgment when using the Service. Use of the Service requires a Wi-Fi or cellular data connection. We may offer the Service only in certain jurisdictions. If we impose technical measures to restrict usage of the Service (or portions thereof), you may not interfere, circumvent or attempt to interfere or circumvent such technical measures.
