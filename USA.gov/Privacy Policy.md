Privacy and Security Policies
=============================

USA.gov doesn't collect personal information when you visit our web site unless you choose to provide that information.

On This Page
------------

*   [Use of Persistent Cookies](#item-211461)
*   [External Links](#item-211458)
*   [If You Send Us Personal Information](#item-211460)

Use of Persistent Cookies
-------------------------

Like many websites, USA.gov uses "persistent cookie" technology. A persistent cookie is a small text file that this website places on your web browser so that it can gather anonymous summary demographic information, and remember your browser when it is used to visit our site again later—kind of like cookie crumbs! (Hence the name.) These cookies uniquely identify a browser on a computer, but never a person.  In other words, if the same person uses Chrome and Internet Explorer, two unique browser cookies will be assigned, one for each browser, so that person will be counted as two different visitors because visits are based on browsers, not computers or persons. We use persistent cookies in two ways, both of which enhance your experience on USA.gov while also protecting your privacy:

*   To remember you when your browser comes back to the site, so we don't invite you to take our customer satisfaction survey every time you visit. Our customer satisfaction survey uses a persistent cookie to ensure we won’t invite you to take a customer satisfaction survey within 90 days of completing a survey on USA.gov.
*   To get aggregate metrics on site usage to understand how people are using the site and how we can make it better. We use web metrics services to track activity on USA.gov. Government agencies only ever receive traffic statistics anonymously and in the aggregate.
*   To gather anonymous summary demographic information about our visitors such as gender, age range, and areas of interest for adults over the age of 18. We do this by using Google Demographic and Interests reports. When you visit a website that has partnered with the Google Display Network, Google stores a number in your browser using a persistent cookie to remember your visits. This number uniquely identifies a web browser, not a specific person. Browsers may be associated with a demographic category, such as gender or age range, based on the sites that were visited. This demographic information is used to help us better understand our visitors' interests and needs to more effectively develop content to serve you.

Most Internet browsers automatically accept persistent cookies. Although using persistent cookies creates a much better experience for you, this site will also work without them. If you don't want to accept cookies, you can edit your browser's options to stop accepting persistent cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. Here's how you can [disable cookies and/or Google Demographic and Interests reports](https://www.usa.gov/optout-instructions).

External Links
--------------

USA.gov links to many websites created and maintained by other public and/or private organizations as outlined in our [Linking Policy](https://www.usa.gov/linking-policy). If you click a link to an outside website, you will leave the USA.gov site, and are subject to the privacy and security policies of the owners/sponsors of the outside website.

### Social Media Sites

USA.gov manages a presence on social media sites such as [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/USAgov), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/USAgov), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/usagov1), [Snapchat](https://www.snapchat.com/add/usagov), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/usagov/), [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/usagov/), and others to share government information, and engage with the public. We do not collect any personally identifiable information through those sites, and we do not use personal information made available by the third-party sites.

If You Send Us Personal Information
-----------------------------------

We do not collect personal information for any purpose other than to respond to your request. The only personal information that we collect is what you decide to give us by [subscribing to our email subscription services](http://connect.usa.gov/subscribe?email=). 

We only share the information you give us with another government agency if your question relates to that agency, or as otherwise required by law. USA.gov never collects information or creates individual profiles for commercial marketing.
