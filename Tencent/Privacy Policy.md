===================================================

Your personal information is processed by our servers located in the People’s Republic of China. Our web maintenance and operation team, and our technical team, are located in the People’s Republic of China.

We will follow legal provisions and regulations strictly, and will take strict and secure protective measures to safeguard your rights in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We use Tencent Cloud to provide information storage services for this service.

**_Only where reasonably necessary_** will we share your personal information. Situations where this occur are:

*   **Companies within our corporate group** who process your personal information in order to respond to your enquiries. All related group companies may only use your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
*   **Regulators, judicial authorities and law enforcement agencies, and other third parties for safety, security, or compliance with the law.** There are circumstances in which we are legally required to disclose information about you to authorities, such as to comply with a legal obligation or processes, enforce our terms, address issues relating to security or fraud, or protect our users. These disclosures may be made with or without your consent, and with or without notice, in compliance with the terms of valid legal process such as a subpoena, court order, or search warrant. We are usually prohibited from notifying you of any such disclosures by the terms of the legal process. We may seek your consent to disclose information in response to a governmental entity’s request when that governmental entity has not provided the required subpoena, court order, or search warrant. We may also disclose your information to:
    *   enforce our terms and conditions and other agreements, including investigation of any potential violation thereof;
    *   detect, prevent or otherwise address security, fraud or technical issues; or
    *   protect the rights, property or safety of us, our users, a third party or the public as required or permitted by law (exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction).
*   **A third party that acquires all or substantially all of us or our business.** We may also disclose your information to third parties if we either: (a) sell, transfer, merge, consolidate or re-organise any part(s) of our business, or merge with, acquire or form a joint venture with, any other business, in which case we may disclose your data to any new owner or other third party involved in such change to our business; or (b) sell or transfer any of our assets, in which case the information we hold about you may be sold as part of those assets and may be transferred to any new owner or other third party involved in such sale or transfer.

4. The Security of Your Personal Information
============================================

We are committed to maintaining the privacy and integrity of your personal information no matter where it is stored. We have information security and access policies that limit access to our systems and technology, and we protect data through the use of technological protection measures such as encryption.

Unfortunately, although we have implemented and maintained reasonable measures to protect your personal information, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. In the event of a security incident such as a personal data breach, we will initiate an emergency plan to prevent the magnification of the security incident, and will notify you via push notifications, announcements, etc.

5. Data Retention
=================

We do not keep your data for longer than is necessary unless we are required to do so under law. We will retain your information as follows:

*   _Information you provide to us when submitting the enquiry form or contacting us using the details specified in this Privacy Policy:_ until your enquiry is resolved, and then erased within one hundred and eighty (180) days of such resolution, unless you agree to have this data retained and receive more information in the future.
*   If we are required to retain your information beyond the retention periods set out above, for example to comply with applicable laws, we will store it separately from other types of personal information.
