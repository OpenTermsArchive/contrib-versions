Terms of Service
================

_Last Updated: June 3, 2024_

Introduction
------------

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the website at IPinfo.io and all interactive features and communications provided in connection with the website (the "Site"). These Terms are an agreement between you and IPinfo Inc., which is the provider and operator of the Site. For the purposes of these Terms, "we," "our," "us," and "IDB" refer to IPinfo Inc.

Your use of the Site indicates your agreement to these Terms. If you are registering for or using the Site on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms for that organization and promising that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms. In that case, "you" and "your" will also refer to that organization, wherever possible.

**PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY. THEY CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR RIGHTS, INCLUDING AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THE MISCELLANEOUS SECTION. THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT REQUIRES MOST DISPUTES BETWEEN US TO BE SUBMITTED TO ARBITRATION, ELIMINATES YOUR ABILITY TO PURSUE DISPUTES AS PART OF A CLASS OR GROUP, AND WAIVES YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL IN COURT AND BY A JURY.**

IDB may change these Terms on a going-forward basis at any time and in our sole discretion. If IDB makes changes to these Terms, we will notify you of the changes by sending a message to the email address we have on file for you or by adding a notice on the Site. We will also update the "Last Updated" date at the top of these Terms when we make changes.

IF YOU HAVE A SEPARATE WRITTEN AGREEMENT WITH IDB FOR DATA SERVICES, THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THAT SEPARATE AGREEMENT APPLY TO THE PROVISION OF THE DATA SERVICES, NOT THESE TERMS.

CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE SITE MAY BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES, TERMS, OR RULES, WHICH WILL BE POSTED ON THE SITE IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH FEATURES. TO THE EXTENT SUCH TERMS, GUIDELINES, AND RULES CONFLICT WITH THESE TERMS, SUCH TERMS SHALL GOVERN SOLELY WITH RESPECT TO SUCH FEATURES. IN ALL OTHER SITUATIONS, THESE TERMS SHALL GOVERN.

Privacy Policy
--------------

The Site is provided in accordance with our Privacy Policy, which can be found at [https://ipinfo.io/privacy-policy](https://ipinfo.io/privacy-policy). You agree to the use of your personal information in accordance with these Terms and IDB's Privacy Policy.

Your Account
------------

You may be asked to register when using the Site. If so, you may be required to provide IDB with certain information, including your name, contact information, username and password ("Credentials"). You are responsible for maintaining and protecting your Credentials and account. You agree to provide true, current, and complete information about yourself or the entity you represent as prompted by the Site's registration or subscription page. If your contact information or other information relating to your account changes, you must notify IDB promptly and keep such information current. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, or we reasonably suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, we may suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Site (or any portion thereof). You are solely responsible for any activity using your Credentials, whether or not you authorized that activity. You should immediately notify IDB of any unauthorized use of your Credentials or if your account or password has been hacked or stolen. If you discover that someone is using your Credentials without your consent, or you discover any other breach of security, you agree to notify IDB immediately.

A variety of information, messages, comments, posts, text, graphics, software, photographs, videos, data, reviews, recommendations, and other materials may be made available through the Site by IDB or its suppliers ("Content").

Miscellaneous
-------------

These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties relating to the Site. These Terms cannot be modified by anyone but IDB. If any part of these Terms is held to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part shall be deemed severed and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions. The failure of IDB to exercise or enforce any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of any right or provision by IDB must be in writing and shall only apply to the specific instance identified in such writing. You may not assign these Terms, or any rights or licenses granted hereunder, whether voluntarily, by operation of law, or otherwise without our prior written consent. These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of Washington without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Except for claims for injunctive relief by either party, any dispute or controversy arising out of, in relation to, or in connection with these Terms or your use of the Site shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in King County, Washington under the then current rules of JAMS (formerly known as Judicial Arbitration & Mediation Services) by one (1) arbitrator appointed in accordance with such rules. The arbitration award may be enforced in any state or federal court with jurisdiction.
