Discord Community Guidelines
============================

#### Effective: September 29, 2025

#### Last Updated: August 29, 2025

‍

Discord enables you to build meaningful connections around the joy of playing games through voice, video and text features. Our Community Guidelines ensure everyone can express themselves and find community — but not at the expense of anyone else.  

These Guidelines are incorporated into our [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms), and further explain what isn’t allowed on Discord so that we can help create a positive environment for everyone. Everyone on Discord must follow these rules, and they apply to all parts of our platform, including your content, behaviors, servers, and apps. To learn more about the requirements for developing a bot or other app on Discord, please refer to our [Discord Developer Terms of Service](https://discord.com/developers/docs/policies-and-agreements/developer-terms-of-service) and our [Discord Developer Policy](https://discord.com/developers/docs/policies-and-agreements/developer-policy).  

If you plan to monetize your content, please review the additional rules outlined in our [Monetization Policy](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/10575066024983) and [Monetization Terms](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/10575066024983).  

Our Trust & Safety team reviews reports by users, moderators, trusted third-party partners, or where required by law. When we proactively or reactively discover a violation of these Guidelines, we may take [a number of enforcement steps](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/18210965981847-Discord-Warning-System) based on the severity of the violation, including issuing warnings, removing content, temporarily suspending account access to Discord, or permanently removing violative accounts and servers, and even reporting them to law enforcement. We may also consider relevant [off-platform behavior when making assessments for violations of specific Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/safety/off-platform-behaviors-policy-explainer).  

If you come across an account, server, or content that appears to break these Guidelines, please [report it to us](https://discord.com/safety/360044103651-reporting-abusive-behavior-to-discord).

If you see any content or activity that violates these Guidelines, our [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms), or any of our other policies, please report it to us. You can learn more on how to report to us [here](https://discord.com/safety/360044103651-reporting-abusive-behavior-to-discord). However, please note that we strongly discourage and [may take action against vigilantism](https://discord.com/safety/child-safety-policy-explainer), as this behavior can put individuals in harm’s way and can also interfere with our investigations and ability to report to law enforcement.  

These Guidelines will continue to evolve over time. This means we may take action against an account, server, or content that violates the spirit of these Guidelines when we encounter a new threat or harm that is not explicitly covered in the current version.  

We will always make our best effort to notify you when we update these Guidelines, but it is up to you to follow them and to use Discord responsibly: Keep Discord safe and help us ensure it remains a great place to build friendships around the joy of playing games. Thanks for doing your part.‍
