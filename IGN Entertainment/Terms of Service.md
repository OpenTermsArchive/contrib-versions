Your use of the Services constitutes your binding acceptance of these terms and conditions, including any changes or modifications made by Ziff Davis as permitted above. Please be sure to review the Agreement periodically to ensure familiarity with the most current version. If at any time the terms and conditions of the Agreement are no longer acceptable to you, you should immediately cease all use of the Services. It is your responsibility to refer to the Agreement upon accessing the Services.

You must be 13 years of age or older to use the Services outside of the European Union and European Economic Area, and 16 years of age or older in the European Union and European Economic Area. Ziff Davis complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and does not permit registration by, and will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from, anyone under 13. By registering for any Services, you represent and warrant that you are 13 years of age or older or, if you reside in the European Union or European Economic Area, 16 years of age or older. Additionally, you must provide true, accurate and complete registration information to become a member of the Services (“Member”). Creating a Member account if you are under the age of 13 outside of the European Union and European Economic Area or 16 in the European Union and European Economic Area, under automated means or under false or fraudulent pretenses constitutes unauthorized use of the Services, and such accounts will be deleted by Ziff Davis.**

As part of the registration process, you may be asked to select a username and password and you will be responsible for all activities occurring under your username and for keeping your password secure. We may refuse to grant you a username that impersonates someone else, violates or infringes on the trademark or proprietary rights of a third party, or is vulgar, offensive, or otherwise inappropriate, as determined by us in our sole discretion. You agree that your username and password is personal to you and should not be used to provide access to the Services to any other person or entity.

By using the Services, you agree to: (a) provide accurate and complete information about yourself as prompted by the registration form for a Service (**“Registration Data”**), (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it accurate and complete, and (c) maintain the security of your password. In the event you compose a profile upon registering for the Services (a **“Member Profile”**), such profile must describe you, an individual person. Examples of inappropriate profiles include, but are not limited to, profiles that purport to represent an animal, place, inanimate object, fictional character, or real individual who is not you. If you wish to view or change your profile, you can do by clicking on the appropriate link listed in the [Updating Your Registration Information](https://www.ziffdavis.com/privacy-policy#control) section of the [Ziff Davis Privacy Policy](https://www.ziffdavis.com/privacy-policy).

For Shopping Services: Certain of Ziff Davis sites allow you to purchase products (“Products”). Such Products and pricing on the sites may change at any time without prior notice to you. You agree that you will only purchase Products on the sites for your own use and enjoyment or as a gift for another person, that all information you submit through the sites is complete, accurate, current and true and that you are not barred from receiving Products under applicable law. Some Products you purchase may be used or contain used parts. Certain software or other materials that you purchase through the sites may be subjected to further export controls. You agree to comply with all applicable export and re-export restrictions, laws and regulations and will not encourage, assist, or authorize the transfer of such products to a prohibited country in violation of law, rule or regulation. Please be advised that an order confirmation to you does not signify acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of an offer to sell. At any time after receipt, your order may be accepted, declined, or quantity restrictions or other limits may be placed on your order for any reason. If you are charged for an order that has been canceled, you may seek a refund for the full amount of the canceled portion of such order. While we strive to make all information on the sites as accurate as possible, we do not warrant that Product descriptions or other content is accurate, complete or error free. Promotions and availability of products are subject to change. Please complete this [form](https://support.stackcommerce.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with any questions on a pending or placed order.

(a) Ziff Davis hereby grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use IGN-created and owned content solely in connection with Loops, which enables you to select a custom “loop” of video footage on IGN videos and to share such “loops” with others via a URL provided by us. By using Loops, you agree that you are using the IGN content for your own personal, non-commercial use. Any text or other content posted by you in connection with Loops must not: (a) be libelous, defamatory, threatening, harassing, hateful, or offensive; (b) may not violate or infringe any third party right, including, but not limited to, any copyright, trademark, right of privacy or publicity, or other personal or proprietary rights; or (c) violate any applicable laws, rules or regulations.

(b) Except as expressly permitted by Ziff Davis or by the owner of the copyright or other such proprietary right, the license granted herein to IGN-created content does not include content or trademarks owned by third parties (including third party content or trademarks incorporated into IGN-created content). By using Loops, you are solely responsible for determining whether your use of Loops complies with applicable laws, including copyright laws, and you accept all risk of liability associated with your use of Loops and any third party claims that may result from your use. You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Ziff Davis from and against any and all liability whatsoever (including attorney’s fees and costs) arising from or related to your use of Loops, including, but not limited to, claims arising from your use of Loops in connection with third party content.

Any use of Loops in violation of the limitations described above is strictly prohibited and may result in immediate termination or revocation of your access to Loops and/or other portions of the Service, and may subject you to legal liability.

For Premium Services: Certain Services provided by Ziff Davis, including but not limited to the IGN Prime Service (the **“IGN Premium Service”**) and paid PC Magazine subscriptions (the **“PC Mag Premium Service”**), require registration and payment (such Services are referred to collectively as the **“Premium Services”**). Please note that the PC Mag Premium Service, including all billing, invoices and renewals, is managed by Ziff Davis’ third party vendor, Palm Coast Data.

(a) Customer Service. For questions about your IGN Premium Service subscription, please visit the IGN FAQs accessible through the [IGN Support Center](http://www.ign.com/support). All questions that cannot be answered via the FAQ page should be sent using the [IGN Support Online Form](http://www.ign.com/support/contact), available through the [IGN Support Center](http://www.ign.com/support). Please include your name and username in all correspondence. For questions about your PC Mag Premium Service, please visit the [PC Magazine Digital Edition Customer Service Page](https://ibm.pcdfusion.com/pcd/CustomerSupport/App/3541) and log into your account.

(b) Payment Obligation and Credit Card Authorization. You are responsible for paying any and all charges relating to your Premium Services account, including without limitation, periodic subscription fees (the initial fee and automatic renewals). You grant to Ziff Davis’ third party payment processor(s) permission to charge your credit card (or other approved payment mechanism) to pay for all such charges. The Premium Service subscription fee will be billed at the beginning of your subscription and on each annual, quarterly or monthly renewal thereafter, dependent on the original subscription term selected at registration, unless you cancel at least ten (10) days prior to the renewal date pursuant to the process set forth below.

For the IGN Premium Service, payment must be made by Visa, MasterCard or American Express or PayPal. For the PC Mag Premium Service, payment must be made by Visa, MasterCard, American Express or Discover. If Ziff Davis does not receive payment from the credit card issuer or its agent, you agree to pay all amounts due upon our demand. Your card issuer agreement governs your use of your designated card in connection with the Premium Services, and you must refer to that agreement and not this Agreement to determine your rights and liabilities as a cardholder. YOU, AND NOT ZIFF DAVIS, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY AMOUNTS BILLED TO YOUR CREDIT CARD BY A THIRD PARTY, EVEN IF THEY WERE NOT AUTHORIZED BY YOU.

ZIFF DAVIS RESERVES THE RIGHT, AT ANY TIME, TO CHANGE ITS FEES AND/OR BILLING METHODS, INCLUDING THE ADDITION OF SUPPLEMENTAL FEES OR SEPARATE CHARGES FOR CONTENT, OR SERVICES PROVIDED BY ZIFF DAVIS, EFFECTIVE THIRTY (30) DAYS AFTER AN ONLINE POSTING ON THE APPLICABLE ZIFF DAVIS SERVICES. ZIFF DAVIS MAY ADDITIONALLY PROVIDE NOTICE OF BILLING CHANGES VIA EMAIL. IF ANY SUCH CHANGE IS UNACCEPTABLE TO YOU, YOU MAY CANCEL YOUR IGN PREMIUM SERVICE SUBSCRIPTION BY VISITING THE [IGN SUPPORT CENTER](http://www.ign.com/support), OR YOUR PC MAG PREMIUM SERVICE SUBSCRIPTION BY VISITING THE [PC MAGAZINE DIGITAL EDITION CUSTOMER SERVICE PAGE](https://ibm.pcdfusion.com/pcd/CustomerSupport/App/3541). YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE PREMIUM SERVICES FOLLOWING THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF A CHANGE TO SUCH FEES AND BILLING METHODS SHALL CONSTITUTE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH CHANGE. ZIFF DAVIS IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY FAILURE TO CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION EITHER IN WRITING BY EMAIL OR LETTER OR THROUGH THE WEBSITE. YOU AGREE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ZIFF DAVIS SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ADJUSTMENTS, REFUNDS OR ACCOUNT OVERSIGHTS THAT YOU HAVE NOT SUBMITTED TO US AS DESCRIBED IN THESE TERMS WITHIN 60 DAYS OF SUCH OCCURRENCE OR LACK THEREOF.

(c) Renewal and Cancellation of Your Subscription. You grant to Ziff Davis’ third party payment processor(s) permission to automatically renew your subscription and charge your account up to seven (7) days prior to the day on which your subscription is scheduled to end. You acknowledge and agree that the authorization to charge your credit card or other payment mechanism for the Premium Services shall automatically transfer to any successors or assigns of the Premium Services for substantially similar services at the same property. You may not assign or transfer your subscription to any other person or entity. You must be at least 18 years old (or have the permission of a credit card holder who is) to subscribe for Premium Services.

(i) _Cancellation of IGN Premium Service._ For the IGN Premium Service, you may “opt out” of this automatic renewal by visiting the [IGN Support Center](http://www.ign.com/support) and canceling on your own or by using our online form to notify Ziff Davis. Ziff Davis will cancel your account upon receipt of such notification from you. All fees, charges and sales are final. Once charged to your credit card, the payments are nonrefundable, except in cases of demonstrated fraud, which will be determined at Ziff Davis’ sole discretion. You acknowledge that canceling your subscription for any reason will not immediately terminate access to the IGN Premium Service and Ziff Davis will not refund the remaining portion of your subscription. Your subscription will remain open until the paid period expires.

(ii) _Cancellation of PC Mag Premium Service._ For PC Magazine paid subscriptions, you may disable automatic renewal and update other settings related to your account by going to the [PC Magazine Digital Edition Customer Service Page](https://ibm.pcdfusion.com/pcd/CustomerSupport/App/3541) and logging into your account, emailing pcmagdigitalcustomerservice.com, or by calling 1-800-289-0429. Your account will be cancelled upon receipt by Ziff Davis’ third party vendor of such notification from you via the Customer Service Page. Upon cancellation of your subscription, you will receive a full refund on all unsent issues.

(d) Termination of Your Subscription. You acknowledge that Ziff Davis, in its sole discretion, may terminate your user ID, password, account (or any part thereof) or use of the Premium Services for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, if Ziff Davis believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of the Agreement. Ziff Davis may also, in its sole discretion, at any time discontinue providing the Premium Services, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Premium Services under any provision of the Agreement may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that Ziff Davis may immediately deactivate or delete your account and/or bar any further access to the Premium Services. If your account is terminated by Ziff Davis, it will not be automatically renewed and access will be terminated, without refund. Further, you agree that Ziff Davis shall not be liable to you or any third-party for termination of your access to the Premium Services. YOU AGREE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ZIFF DAVIS SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ADJUSTMENTS, REFUNDS OR ACCOUNT OVERSIGHTS PAST SIXTY (60) DAYS OF SUCH OCCURRENCE.

(e) Trial Memberships. Ziff Davis may occasionally offer promotional trial memberships to its IGN Premium Service at special discounted prices. If you sign up for a trial membership, you will be automatically renewed at the normal subscription rate for the IGN Premium Service at the end of the trial period, unless you cancel at least twenty-four (24) hours before the end of the trial. You must cancel prior to the end of your trial to avoid charges to your credit card. We will continue to bill your credit card for the IGN Premium Service at the standard IGN Premium Service rate and renewal term thereafter, dependent on the original subscription term selected at registration, until you cancel. For information about canceling your IGN Premium Service subscription, visit the [IGN Support Center.](http://www.ign.com/support)

You must promptly inform Ziff Davis of any of the following: changes in the expiration date of any credit card used in connection with the Premium Services; changes in home or billing address; and apparent breaches of security, such as loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure or use of an ID or password. You agree to notify Ziff Davis immediately upon learning of any potential breach of your Premium Services account.
