As part of the registration process, you may be asked to select a username and password and you will be responsible for keeping your password secure and for all activities occurring under your username.. We may refuse to grant you a username that impersonates someone else, violates or infringes on the trademark or proprietary rights of a third party, or is vulgar, offensive, or otherwise inappropriate, as determined by us in our sole discretion. You agree that your username and password is personal to you and should not be used to provide access to the Services to any other person or entity.

By using the Services, you agree to: (a) provide accurate and complete information about yourself as prompted by the registration form for a Service (**“Registration Data”**), (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it accurate and complete, and (c) maintain the security of your password.

**Access to the Site and Services:**  

Ziff Davis strives to allow access to the Site 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, apart from necessary maintenance operations and possible breakdowns. Ziff Davis is only bound by an obligation to make every effort to provide access to the Site and the Services and cannot be held responsible, and declines all responsibility, for any and all inaccessibility of the Site, interruption or temporary stoppage of Services. This could occur and would not be a violation of its contractual obligations under these terms and Conditions or its legal obligations, in particular in terms of the security of personal data, and this, whatever their nature (including without limitation computer viruses, unlawful intrusion into an automated data processing system, temporary stoppage of the service, etc.).

Ziff Davis cannot guarantee the continuity of the Site, its permanence, or its compatibility with your operating system or your browser. You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for the proper functioning of your equipment.

**For Shopping Services:**

Certain Ziff Davis sites allow you to purchase products (“Products”). Such Products and pricing on the sites may change at any time without prior notice to you. You agree that you will only purchase Products on the sites for your own use and enjoyment or as a gift for another person, that all information you submit through the sites is complete, accurate, current and true and that you are not barred from receiving Products under applicable law. Some Products you purchase may be used or contain used parts. Certain software or other materials that you purchase through the sites may be subjected to further export controls. You agree to comply with all applicable export and re-export restrictions, laws and regulations and will not encourage, assist, or authorize the transfer of such products to a prohibited country in violation of law, rule or regulation. Please be advised that an order confirmation to you does not signify acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of an offer to sell. At any time after receipt, your order may be accepted, declined, or quantity restrictions or other limits may be placed on your order for any reason. If you are charged for an order that has been canceled, you may seek a refund for the full amount of the canceled portion of such order.

_Participation; Adding and Using Vouchers and Discount Codes:_  

Members are encouraged to play an active role on the Site and have the possibility of posting Discount Coupons, Refund Offers on the Site as well as publishing Opinions concerning their online shopping experiences on merchant sites, subject to compliance with the conditions described in this Agreement.

Coupons and discount codes may be added by Members of the Site. Their distribution is subject to validation. Members of the Site undertake to add coupons or discount codes with as much detail as possible and not to add personalized coupons or discount codes (i.e. a code for the single use of the person).  Ziff Davis reserves the right to modify and delete the voucher at any time.

The use of vouchers and discount codes implies that the user of the Site clicks on the buttons “Display the code and launch the site” or “display the site” or even on the graphic banner of the Site. These buttons/links cause the opening in a new browser window of the merchant site receiving the reduction voucher you have selected. After each use of a code or discount voucher, the Site invites you to indicate the correct or incorrect functioning using the interface provided for this purpose. We also invite you to leave a comment to provide additional information. These notices will allow us to remove invalid discount codes.

Under no circumstances can Ziff Davis be held liable for comments made by the Member on the Site. The Member acknowledges under the terms of the terms and conditions to be solely responsible for the opinions left on the Site. The Member undertakes that said opinions shall not infringe the rights and legitimate interests of a third party. The Member therefore guarantees Ziff Davis against any recourse based on his remarks and to bear all the costs resulting from this recourse. These costs include in particular any damages owed by Ziff Davis in respect of said action as well as attorney’s fees and court costs.

Participation in any Promotion and the opportunity to earn Rewards from any Promotion are oﬀered at the sole discretion of RetailMeNot. Purchases for resale or commercial use are excluded from eligibility. Further, Reward earnings are subject to adjustment to reflect any returns or cancellations of Qualifying Transactions.  In any calendar month, you are limited to the Number of Rewards Oﬀers per Person and the amount that may be earned, in the aggregate under all RetailMeNot Rewards Oﬀers, may be limited.

_How to Earn RetailMeNot Cash Back Rewards._ Online Cash Back Rewards. To earn Rewards pursuant to a Rewards Oﬀer for Online Cash Back Rewards, you must: (1) during the Promotion Period, click on the Promotion Link right before making an online purchase via the Merchant’s website; (2) complete the online purchase in an amount equal or greater to the Minimum Purchase Amount; and (3) satisfy any and all other conditions speciﬁed on the Promotion Landing Page. Upon veriﬁcation that your purchase qualiﬁes and that you have satisﬁed applicable requirements, the Reward speciﬁed for the applicable Rewards Oﬀer will be considered an Approved Reward. YOU MUST CLICK ON THE PROMOTION LINK FOR THE REWARDS OFFER DURING THE SAME SHOPPING SESSION THAT YOU COMPLETE YOUR PURCHASE FROM THE MERCHANT. THE PURCHASE MUST BE MADE IN US DOLLARS. IF YOU VISIT OTHER SITES BEFORE COMPLETING YOUR PURCHASE, OR IF YOU USE COUPON CODES NOT PROVIDED BY  RETAILMENOT,  YOUR PURCHASE MAY BE ASSOCIATED  WITH A SERVICE OTHER THAN RETAILMENOT AND YOU MAY NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE REWARD(S). YOU MUST NOT ENABLE AN AD BLOCKER OR OTHERWISE DISABLE COOKIES ON YOUR COMPUTER, BECAUSE COOKIES ARE USED TO AUTHENTICATE YOUR PURCHASE.

_RetailMeNot In-Store Cash Back Rewards._ To earn Rewards pursuant to a Rewards Oﬀer for In-Store Cash Back Rewards by submitting a Receipt, you must: (1) Activate the Rewards Oﬀer, if applicable; (2) complete the required purchase via a Qualiﬁed Transaction; (3) submit a valid, readable Receipt through the Promotion Landing Page in accordance with the stated terms; and (4) satisfy any and all other conditions speciﬁed on the Promotion Landing Page or Rewards Oﬀer Card.

If you complete the obligations in Sections 4(b)(i) and 4(b)(ii) and the Reward Offer is still available, the Reward specified for the applicable Reward Offer will be considered an Approved Award.

_RetailMeNot Receipt Scanning._ You agree to at all times provide accurate and complete information to RetailMeNot. You agree not to: submit a Receipt that is false, inaccurate, fabricated, counterfeited, incomplete, tampered with, adjusted, or otherwise inauthentic for the purpose of seeking to claim a Reward; redeem, or attempt to redeem, a Reward for products that have not actually been purchased, or for products that have been returned; submit or attempt to submit a Receipt that has already been submitted or used by you or another user; or submit Receipts outside of a Promotion Period, or for a purchase that took place prior to or after the launch date of a Rewards Oﬀer. 

RetailMeNot may, in its sole discretion, extend or shorten the redemption period for a Rewards Oﬀer.

As between you and RetailMeNot, the determination as to what transactions are Qualifying Transactions shall be made by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion.

_Bonus Rewards._ From time to time, RetailMeNot may oﬀer a Bonus Reward to certain RetailMeNot members who complete a qualifying activity or who meet certain criteria, as deﬁned in a Rewards Oﬀer Card or Promotion Landing Page, in addition to or in combination with oﬀers for Online Cash Back Rewards or In-Store Cash Back Rewards. For example, RetailMeNot may oﬀer certain Bonus Rewards to new members who earn an Online Cash Back Reward for the ﬁrst time or earn certain Online Cash Back Rewards for the ﬁrst time. In order to earn a Bonus Reward, you must satisfy all criteria set forth for earning the Bonus Reward as well as the requirements of these Promotion Terms during the promotion period for the Bonus Reward. RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, may adjust the promotion period and/or the bonus amount for Bonus Reward, at any time, without notice. All decisions by RetailMeNot are ﬁnal and binding on you. Bonus Rewards are a limited time oﬀer and all criteria must be satisﬁed within the dates of the Promotion.

_Returns, Approvals, and No Ownership._ For any Rewards Oﬀer, if you return or exchange the items purchased, complete your purchase before or after the Promotion Period, initiate a purchase that results in a chargeback, or fail to satisfy a Minimum Purchase Amount, or any other conditions speciﬁed on the Promotion Landing Page or Rewards Oﬀer Card, RetailMeNot reserves the right to invalidate or withdraw all or part of the Rewards Oﬀer, or reclaim Reward earnings. The determination of whether or not a purchase qualiﬁes for the Rewards Oﬀer and whether applicable conditions have been satisﬁed is at the sole discretion of RetailMeNot. In the event of a dispute, you may be required to provide your order conﬁrmation as proof of purchase. Order confirmations must be provided within six (6) months from the purchase date to qualify for this review. The timing of when RetailMeNot will issue an Approved Reward will vary based on a number of factors. These factors may include the type of Promotion pursuant to which a Reward is oﬀered and your account activity as a member of RetailMeNot. RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine the order and timing in which to process its conﬁrmation of eligible purchases. Rewards may be limited where participation exceeds the Total Rewards Oﬀers available during Promotion or in other cases, as determined by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. RetailMeNot also reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reevaluate Approved Rewards, at any time, without notice, including, but not limited to, whether purchases qualify for the Promotion and whether applicable conditions have been satisﬁed, and RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, may adjust or withdraw any Rewards Oﬀers or any Approved Rewards (or reclaim Reward earnings), at any time, without notice. All decisions by RetailMeNot are ﬁnal and binding on you.

Participating in a Rewards Oﬀer does not give you ownership or any other legal claim to any Reward unless and until RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, determines that you have met all eligibility criteria and fulﬁlled all requirements for the Promotion and you have completed the Redemption Process. Rewards Oﬀers are provided solely by RetailMeNot and are not underwritten or funded by any other third party. You may not make any claims for Rewards Oﬀers against Merchants or any other third party. Notwithstanding that Rewards Oﬀers may include oﬀers of cash, prior to redemption, Rewards Oﬀers and Approved Rewards have no monetary value and you may not obtain any money or any other thing of value for any Approved Reward or participation in any Rewards Oﬀer unless and until you complete the Redemption Process and a payment has been issued by RetailMeNot for Approved Rewards.

_Wallet and Redeeming Rewards_. Approved Rewards will be shown in the RetailMeNot Rewards Wallet. You have no vested rights in Approved Rewards unless and until you complete the Redemption Process. If your RetailMeNot account is terminated by RetailMeNot, as provided in these Promotion Terms or the Terms of Use, or if you elect to close your RetailMeNot account, you will no longer be permitted to access the Rewards Wallet or redeem Approved Rewards shown therein. You may redeem Approved Rewards for cash using PayPal or Venmo.

Redeeming for cash to Paypal or Venmo. In order to redeem Approved Rewards for cash via PayPal or Venmo, you must: (1) have or create a PayPal or Venmo Account that is linked to the phone number or email address, where applicable, that RetailMeNot has on ﬁle for you; (2) navigate to the “My Rewards” section of your account, click “Redeem Rewards”, and then click either “Paypal” or “Venmo”, as applicable; and (3) perform any actions speciﬁed in the RetailMeNot app or website, as modiﬁed from time to time in the sole discretion of RetailMeNot. For example, such actions may include, but are not limited to, authenticating your account by providing a US based cell phone number with SMS capabilities, re-entering a password, and clicking the appropriate link or button. Once you have completed the required steps to redeem Approved Rewards, RetailMeNot will issue a payment to the PayPal or Venmo Account, as applicable, that is linked to the email address, or phone number, as applicable, that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account. An email or text message, where applicable, will be sent to that email address or phone number, where applicable, conﬁrming that the payment has been issued. Generally, redemption of an Approved Reward will result in the issuing of payment within minutes, but in some cases may require a longer time period. RetailMeNot is not responsible for lost or stolen payments or for delivery of payments to the wrong PayPal or Venmo account. 

If an account has not been credited with a Qualifying Transaction in the previous 12 months, it may be deemed an Inactive Cash Back Account. Accounts which meet this criteria will be debited a monthly maintenance fee in the amount of the lesser of $2.00 or the current account balance. Maintenance fees will not draw the account balance below $0.00. Maintenance fees will be assessed until the account balance reaches $0.00 or the account becomes an active cash back user again. 

_Forced Redemptions_. You are responsible for ensuring compliance with any limitations or requirements speciﬁed by RetailMeNot from time to time, including, but not limited to, requirements not to redeem Approved Rewards that exceed amounts speciﬁed by RetailMeNot. RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, from time to time, to cause the redemption of Approved Rewards, in whole or in part, and issue payments to the PayPal or Venmo account linked to the email address or phone number that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account, but RetailMeNot undertakes no obligation to do so under any circumstances. You hereby authorize RetailMeNot to perform any such redemptions and issue any such payments to the PayPal or Venmo account linked to the email address or phone number that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account, automatically and without further action by you.

_Abuse and Cancellations_. RetailMeNot reserves the right to cancel, suspend and/or modify a user’s account, entire Promotion, or any part of it, or the payment of any Rewards amounts at any time without obligation or notice to you, including, without limitation, if any fraud, technical failures, limit of available Rewards, gaming, human error or any other factor impairs the integrity, availability or proper functioning of the Promotion, as determined by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. Without limiting anything  in these Promotion Terms or the Terms of Use, RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to disqualify, terminate or suspend the participation in any Promotion, or otherwise prevent future participation, of any individual it ﬁnds, or reasonably suspects, to be tampering with the operation of a Promotion (including by submitting or attempting to submit fraudulent or ineligible Receipts) or to be acting in violation of the Promotion Terms or any promotion,  or in behaving in an unethical, dishonest, deceptive or disruptive manner. Any attempt by any person to deliberately undermine the legitimate operation of the Promotion may be in violation of criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt be made, RetailMeNot reserves the right to seek damages from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law. RetailMeNot shall not be liable to you for any suspension, modiﬁcation or termination of a Rewards Oﬀer, Approved Rewards, or the Promotion program.

Use of any automated means or more than one account is prohibited and will result in disqualiﬁcation. In the event of any dispute as to the qualiﬁcation of potential recipients of a Reward, the authorized account holder of the email address or phone number provided to RetailMeNot at the time the account was created will be deemed the qualiﬁed Reward recipient. The “authorized account holder” is the natural person assigned an email address by an Internet access provider, online service provider or other organization responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted address. Each potential recipient of Rewards may be required to show proof of being an authorized account holder.

If your account remains inactive for 24 months, RetailMeNot reserves the right to permanently close the Account at which time the cash back rewards will be considered expired and will no longer be eligible for redemption. Before closing the Account, RetailMeNot will attempt to alert you to the fact that your account may be shut down due to inactivity.

_Premium Services_: Certain Services provided by Ziff Davis require registration and payment (such Services are referred to collectively as the **“Premium Services”**). You are responsible for paying any and all charges relating to your Premium Services account, including without limitation, periodic subscription fees (the initial fee and automatic renewals). You grant to Ziff Davis’ third party payment processor(s) permission to charge your credit card (or other approved payment mechanism) to pay for all such charges. The Premium Service subscription fee will be billed at the beginning of your subscription and on each annual, quarterly or monthly renewal thereafter, dependent on the original subscription term selected at registration, unless you cancel at least ten (10) days prior to the renewal date pursuant to the process set forth below.

If Ziff Davis does not receive payment from the credit card issuer or its agent, you agree to pay all amounts due upon our demand. Your card issuer agreement governs your use of your designated card in connection with the Premium Services, and you must refer to that agreement and not this Agreement to determine your rights and liabilities as a cardholder. YOU, AND NOT ZIFF DAVIS, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY AMOUNTS BILLED TO YOUR CREDIT CARD BY A THIRD PARTY, EVEN IF THEY WERE NOT AUTHORIZED BY YOU.

Ziff Davis currently provides IGN users with access to a variety of Services, including but not limited to, community boards, user pages, wikis, and blogs. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features or services shall be subject to the Agreement. In order to use certain Services, you will be required to register with IGN.

Customer Service. For questions about IGN or the IGN Plus service, please visit the [**IGN FAQ**](https://corp.ign.com/frequently-asked-questions) or contact  [**IGN Support**](https://corp.ign.com/support). 

_Payment Obligation and Credit Card Authorization_. You are responsible for paying any and all charges relating to your Premium Services account, including without limitation, periodic subscription fees (the initial fee and automatic renewals). You grant to Ziff Davis’ third party payment processor(s) permission to charge your credit card (or other approved payment mechanism) to pay for all such charges. The Premium Service subscription fee will be billed at the beginning of your subscription and on each annual, quarterly or monthly renewal thereafter, dependent on the original subscription term selected at registration, unless you cancel at least ten (10) days prior to the renewal date pursuant to the process set forth below.

For IGN Plus, payment must be made by Visa, MasterCard, American Express, PayPal or other options as listed on the relevant commerce platform. For the PC Mag Premium Service, payment must be made by Visa, MasterCard, American Express or Discover. If Ziff Davis does not receive payment from the credit card issuer or its agent, you agree to pay all amounts due upon our demand. Your card issuer agreement governs your use of your designated card in connection with the Premium Services, and you must refer to that agreement and not this Agreement to determine your rights and liabilities as a cardholder. YOU, AND NOT ZIFF DAVIS, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY AMOUNTS BILLED TO YOUR CREDIT CARD BY A THIRD PARTY, EVEN IF THEY WERE NOT AUTHORIZED BY YOU.

_Renewal and Cancellation of Your Subscription._ You grant to Ziff Davis’ third party payment processor(s) permission to automatically renew your subscription and charge your account up to seven (7) days prior to the day on which your subscription is scheduled to end. You acknowledge and agree that the authorization to charge your credit card or other payment mechanism for the Premium Services shall automatically transfer to any successors or assigns of the Premium Services for substantially similar services at the same property. You may not assign or transfer your subscription to any other person or entity. You must be at least 18 years old (or have the permission of a credit card holder who is) to subscribe for Premium Services.

_Cancellation of IGN Plus._ For the IGN Plus, you may “opt out” of this automatic renewal by visiting your [**Account Settings**](https://www.ign.com/account/settings) or the [**IGN Support**](http://www.ign.com/support). All fees, charges and sales are final. Once charged to your credit card, the payments are nonrefundable, except in cases of demonstrated fraud, which will be determined at Ziff Davis’ sole discretion. You acknowledge that canceling your subscription for any reason will not immediately terminate access to the IGN Plus and Ziff Davis will not refund the remaining portion of your subscription. Your subscription will remain open until the paid period expires.

_Trial Memberships._ Ziff Davis may occasionally offer promotional trial memberships to IGN Plus at special discounted prices. If you sign up for a trial membership, you will be automatically renewed at the normal subscription rate for IGN Plus at the end of the trial period, unless you cancel at least twenty-four (24) hours before the end of the trial. You must cancel prior to the end of your trial to avoid charges to your credit card. We will continue to bill your credit card for the IGN Plus at the standard IGN Plus rate and renewal term thereafter, dependent on the original subscription term selected at registration, until you cancel. For information about canceling your IGN Plus subscription, visit the [**IGN Support Center.**](http://www.ign.com/support)

YOU AGREE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ZIFF DAVIS SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ADJUSTMENTS, REFUNDS OR ACCOUNT OVERSIGHTS PAST SIXTY (60) DAYS OF SUCH OCCURRENCE.

13\. Binding Arbitration
------------------------

**In the unlikely event that you’re not satisfied with customer service’s solution, and you and Ziff Davis are unable to resolve a dispute through the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures below, we each agree to resolve the dispute through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.**

Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Unless expressly limited by this arbitration provision, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. **Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.** In arbitration you may be entitled to recover attorneys’ fees from us to the same extent as you would be in court.

**ARBITRATION AGREEMENT**

(1) **Claims Subject to Arbitration**: To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Ziff Davis and you agree to arbitrate **all disputes and claims** between us, except for claims arising from bodily injury or that pertain to enforcing, protecting, or the validity of your or our intellectual property rights (or the intellectual property rights of any of our licensors, affiliates and partners). This Arbitration Agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:

* claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other statutory or common-law legal theory;

* claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);

* claims for mental or emotional distress or injury not arising out of physical bodily injury;

* claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a current member of a certified class; and

* claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.

References to “Ziff Davis,” “you,” “we” and “us” in this Arbitration Agreement include our respective predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as our respective past, present, and future parents, subsidiaries and affiliates (including Ziff Davis, Inc., Ziff Davis, LLC, Everyday Health, Inc., Everyday Health Media, LLC, and their affiliates); those entities and our respective agents, employees, licensees, licensors, and providers of content as of the time your or our claim arises; and all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of Services under this or prior Agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may elect to have claims heard in small claims court seeking only individualized relief, so long as the action is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction. This Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. **You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and we are each waiving the right to participate in a class action and to a trial by jury to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.** This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. This Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement.

(2) **Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures**: You and we agree that good-faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, cost-effective and mutually beneficial outcome. Therefore, a party who intends to initiate arbitration or file a claim in small claims court must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). A Notice from you to Ziff Davis must be emailed to dispute.notice@ziffdavis.com (“Notice Address”).

Any Notice must include (i) the claimant’s name, address, and email address; (ii) a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (iii) if you are submitting the Notice, any relevant facts regarding your use of the Sites, including whether you have created an account with or receive any newsletters associated with any of the Sites; (iv) a description of the nature and basis of the specific relief sought, including the damages sought, if any, and a detailed calculation for them; and (v) a personally signed statement from the claimant (and not their counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Notice. The Notice must be individualized, meaning it can concern only your dispute and no other person’s dispute. 

After receipt of a completed Notice, the parties shall engage in a good faith effort to resolve the dispute for a period of 60 days (which can be extended by agreement). You and we agree that, after receipt of the completed Notice, the recipient may request an individualized video settlement conference (which can be held after the 60-day period) and both parties will personally attend (with counsel, if represented). If you are unable to participate in the settlement conference by video, you may attend telephonically upon showing of good cause or extraordinary circumstances warranting telephonic participation (e.g., inability to afford equipment or sufficient Wi-Fi due to indigent circumstances). You and we agree that the parties (and counsel, if represented) shall work cooperatively to schedule the conference at the earliest mutually convenient time and to seek to reach a resolution. If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the issues identified in the Notice within 60 days after the completed Notice is received (or a longer time if agreed to by the parties), you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding or a small claims court proceeding (if permitted by small claims court rules).

Compliance with this Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures section is a condition precedent to initiating arbitration. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution procedures set forth in this Section 13(2). All of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are essential so that you and Ziff Davis have a meaningful opportunity to resolve disputes informally. If any aspect of these requirements has not been met, a court of competent jurisdiction may enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration. In addition, unless prohibited by law, the arbitration administrator may not accept, administer, assess, or demand fees in connection with an arbitration that has been initiated without completion of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures. If the arbitration is already pending, it shall be administratively closed. Nothing in this paragraph limits the right of a party to seek damages for non-compliance with these Procedures in arbitration.

(3) **Arbitration Procedure**: The arbitration will be governed by applicable rules of National Arbitration & Mediation (“NAM”) (including the Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or the Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, as applicable) (“NAM Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement, and will be administered by NAM. (If NAM is unavailable or unwilling to do so, another arbitration provider shall be selected by the parties that will do so, or if the parties are unable to agree on an alternative administrator, by the court pursuant to 9 U.S.C. §5.) The NAM Rules are available online at [www.namadr.com](http://www.namadr.com/) or by requesting them in writing at the Notice Address. You may obtain a form to initiate arbitration at: [https://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2020/09/Comprehensive-Demand-for-Arb-revised-9.18.19.pdf or by contacting NAM](https://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2020/09/Comprehensive-Demand-for-Arb-revised-9.18.19.pdf).

We and you agree that the party initiating arbitration must submit a certification that they have complied with and completed the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures requirements referenced in Section 13(2) and that they are a party to the Arbitration Agreement enclosed with or attached to the demand for arbitration. The demand for arbitration and certification must be personally signed by the party initiating arbitration (and their counsel, if represented).

All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except as otherwise expressly provided herein. The arbitrator may consider but shall not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations involving different customers.

Unless we and you agree otherwise, or the applicable NAM Rules dictate otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address and you and a Ziff Davis representative will be required to attend in person. At the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitrator’s decision is binding only between you and Ziff Davis and will not have any preclusive effect in another arbitration or proceeding that involves a different party. An arbitrator’s award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court.

As in court, you and Ziff Davis agree that any counsel representing a party in arbitration certifies when initiating and proceeding in arbitration that they are complying with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), including certification that the claim or relief sought is neither frivolous nor brought for an improper purpose.

The arbitrator is authorized to impose any sanctions under the NAM Rules, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, or applicable federal or state law, against all appropriately represented parties and counsel. 

Except as expressly provided in the Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may grant any remedy, relief, or outcome that the parties could have received in court, including awards of attorneys’ fees and costs, in accordance with applicable law. Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, the parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator awards sanctions or finds that either the substance of the claim, the defense, or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 (b)).

(4) **Arbitration Fees**: The payment of arbitration fees (the fees imposed by the arbitration administrator including filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees) will be governed by the applicable NAM Rules, unless you qualify for a fee waiver under applicable law. If after exhausting any potentially available fee waivers, the arbitrator finds that the arbitration fees will be prohibitive for you as compared to litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or asserted in bad faith. You and we agree that arbitration should be cost-effective for all parties and that any party may engage with NAM to address the reduction or deferral of fees.

(5) **Confidentiality**: Upon either party’s request, the arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal to the furthest extent permitted by law.

(6) **Offer of Settlement**: In any arbitration between you and Ziff Davis, the defending party may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement offer at any time before the evidentiary hearing or, if a dispositive motion is permitted, prior to the dispositive motion being granted. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If the award is issued in the other party’s favor and is less than the defending party’s settlement offer or if the award is in the defending party’s favor, the other party must pay the defending party’s costs incurred after the offer was made, including any attorney’s fees. If any applicable statute or case law prohibits the shifting of costs incurred in the arbitration, then the offer in this provision shall serve to cease the accumulation of any costs to which the party bringing the claim may be entitled for the cause of action under which it is suing.

(7) **Requirement of Individualized Relief**: The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. **TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING**. Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, class, or private attorney general proceeding. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, any of these prohibitions on non-individualized declaratory or injunctive relief; class, representative, and private attorney general claims; and consolidation are found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or with respect to a particular request for relief (such as a request for injunctive relief sought with respect to a particular claim), then the parties agree such a claim or request for relief shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction, after all other arbitrable claims and requests for relief are arbitrated. You agree that any arbitrations between you and Ziff Davis will be subject to this Section 13 and not to any prior arbitration agreement you had with Ziff Davis, and, notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that this Section 13 amends any prior arbitration agreement you had with Ziff Davis, including with respect to claims that arose before this or any prior arbitration agreement. 

(8) **Opt Out of Future Changes**: Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, if Ziff Davis makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending Ziff Davis an email to dispute.notice@ziffdavis.com within 30 days of the posting of the amended arbitration agreement that provides: (i) your full legal name, (ii) your complete mailing address, (iii) your phone number, (iv) if applicable, the username or email address associated with any potential account or newsletter; (v) the relevant Site; and (vi) the approximate date of your initial use of the relevant Site. Such an opt-out email must be sent by you personally, and not by your agent, attorney, or anyone else purporting to act on your behalf. It must include a statement, personally signed by you, that you wish to reject the change to the Arbitration Agreement. This is not an opt out of arbitration altogether.

(9) **Mass Filing**: If, at any time, 25 or more claimants (including you) submit Notices or seek to file demands for arbitration raising similar claims against the other party or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities, consistent with the definition and criteria of Mass Filings (“Mass Filing”) set forth in NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (“NAM’s Mass Filing Rules,” available at https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/), you and we agree that the additional procedures set forth below shall apply. The parties agree that throughout this process, their counsel shall meet and confer to discuss modifications to these procedures based on the particular needs of the Mass Filing. The parties acknowledge and agree that by electing to participate in a Mass Filing, the adjudication of their dispute might be delayed. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled beginning when the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are initiated, so long as the pre-arbitration Notice complies with the requirements in Section 13(2), until your claim is selected to proceed as part of a staged process or is settled, withdrawn, otherwise resolved, or opted out of arbitration.

**Stage One**: Counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 25 claims per side (50 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this initial set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Ziff Davis shall pay the mediator’s fee.

**Stage Two**: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 50 claims per side (100 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a second staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this second set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Ziff Davis shall pay the mediator’s fee.

**Stage Three**: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 100 claims per side (200 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a third staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. Following this third set of staged proceedings, counsel for claimants may elect to have the parties participate in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge. 

**Stage Four**:  If your claim is not resolved at this time, then you agree that your claim will be resolved as part of continuing, staged individual arbitration proceedings as set forth below. Assuming the number of remaining claims exceeds 100, then 100 claims shall be randomly selected (or selected through a process agreed to by counsel for the parties) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. If the number of remaining claims is fewer than 100, then all of those claims shall be filed and proceed in individual arbitrations. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After each set of 100 claims are adjudicated, settled, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved, this process shall repeat consistent with these parameters. Counsel for the parties are encouraged to meet and confer, participate in mediation, and engage with each other and with NAM (including through a Procedural Arbitrator) to explore ways to streamline the adjudication of claims, increase the number of claims to proceed at any given time, promote efficiencies, conserve resources, and resolve the remaining claims.  

A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enforce these Mass Filing provisions and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing, prosecution, or administration of arbitrations and the assessment of arbitration fees. If these additional procedures apply to your claim, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that they are not enforceable as to your claim, then your claim shall proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with this Agreement.

You and Ziff Davis agree that we each value the integrity and efficiency of arbitration and wish to employ the process for the fair resolution of genuine and sincere disputes between us. You and Ziff Davis acknowledge and agree to act in good faith to ensure the processes set forth herein are followed. The parties further agree that application of these Mass Filing procedures have been reasonably designed to result in an efficient and fair adjudication of such cases.  
(10) **Severability**: If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall be deemed to be severable and, if possible, superseded by a valid, enforceable provision, or portion thereof, that matches the intent of the original provision, or portion thereof, as closely as possible. The remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall continue to be enforceable and valid according to the terms contained herein.

14\. CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER
---------------------------------------

You and Ziff Davis agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each party may bring claims (whether in court or in arbitration) against the other only in an individual capacity, and not participate as a plaintiff, claimant, or class member in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding. This means that you and Ziff Davis may not bring a claim on behalf of a class or group and may not bring a claim on behalf of any other person unless doing so as a parent, guardian, or ward of a minor or in another similar capacity for an individual who cannot otherwise bring their own individual claim. This also means that you and Ziff Davis may not participate in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding brought by any third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you or Ziff Davis may participate in a class-wide settlement. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you and Ziff Davis waive any right to a jury trial.

15\. Limitation Period for Claims
---------------------------------

You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of our sites or the Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.

16\. Miscellaneous
------------------

We may be required by international, state or federal law to notify you of certain events. You hereby acknowledge and consent that such notices will be effective upon our posting them on our sites or delivering them to you through e-mail. Subject to the arbitration provision above and for all purposes of this Agreement, this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without reference to principles of choice of law. You and Ziff Davis each irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in New York, New York, the Borough of Manhattan (the “Courts”) with respect to any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or to the Services (including without limitation any Content) and waive any objection to venue in any of the Courts for such an action, suit or proceeding (whether based on forum non conveniens or otherwise); additionally, you agree that you will not bring any such action, suit or proceeding in any court other than the Courts.

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all previous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter. If any inconsistency exists between the terms of this Agreement and any additional terms and conditions posted on the Services, such terms shall be interpreted as to eliminate any inconsistency, if possible, and otherwise, the additional terms and conditions shall control. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, (i) such provision shall be interpreted in such a manner as to preserve, to the maximum extent possible, the intent of the parties, (ii) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and (iii) such decision shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision under other circumstances.  Ziff Davis’ failure to enforce any term of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of that provision.  No waiver shall be binding unless in writing and signed by Ziff Davis, and such waiver shall not be construed as Ziff Davis’ waiver of any other or subsequent breach.

17\. New Jersey Residents
-------------------------

If, and to the extent that New Jersey law applies, with respect to residents of New Jersey, the terms in Sections 6 (insofar as any claims may arise from, or relate to, consumer protection or fraud and/or misrepresentation, or result in attorney’s fees), 9 and 14 do not limit any rights you may have as a consumer under New Jersey law and are intended to be only as broad and inclusive as permitted by the laws of the state of your residence. Subject to the foregoing, Ziff Davis, third party content providers, and their respective agents reserve all rights, defenses, and permissible limitations under New Jersey law. Nothing in this Section shall modify the binding arbitration clause and waiver for class action and jury trial in Section 13.

18\. Australia Residents
------------------------

Nothing in these Terms (including in Sections 6, 9 and 15) limits, excludes or modifies any rights you may have under any law, including under the Australian Consumer Law (the “ACL”) and consumer guarantees under the ACL, which may not be limited, excluded or modified by agreement (including where such exclusion, restriction or modification would be illegal or void under such law).
