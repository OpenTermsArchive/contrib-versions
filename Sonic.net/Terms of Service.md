This includes for example but is not limited to: abuse of an email account or dial-up add-on which is part of a customer's account but which is used by a third party or abuse of a co-located server or co-location services by a third party, with or without the account owner's permission.

*   Legal action

Dial-up Connection policy
=========================

Dial-up accounts are intended for interactive use by a single individual. [Sonic.net](https://www.sonic.com/), LLC reserves the right to terminate idle connections, that is, connections that have been unused for 15 minutes. Personal accounts are limited to one login at any given time. [Sonic.net](https://www.sonic.com/), LLC provides unlimited Internet access to its dial-up customers. "Unlimited Internet access" is defined as un-metered, on-demand dial-up access; this is different from dedicated ("always-on") access. In order to ensure that dial-up services remain available to all dial-up customers, [Sonic.net](https://www.sonic.com/), LLC reserves the right to terminate any dial-up connection that exceeds twelve consecutive hours duration. [Sonic.net](https://www.sonic.com/), LLC assumes that anyone consistently using a dial-up connection for more than twelve consecutive hours at a time will need dedicated-line access. If you consistently use your dial-up account as a dedicated-line account, you will be billed for it accordingly. Dedicated lines are available for an additional monthly charge. [Sonic.net](https://www.sonic.com/), LLC also offers several high-speed, dedicated ("always on") account types. Please see our sales page at [http://www.sonic.net/sales](http://www.sonic.net/sales) for more information.

WiFi Network Sharing Policy
===========================

For [Sonic.net](https://www.sonic.com/), LLC services where customer premise equipment is provided, owned and managed by [Sonic.net](https://www.sonic.com/), LLC that equipment may be used at some point in the future to provide WiFi access to others. If and when this is offered, it will be secured and separate from your own traffic and your local area network, and would provide limited access to guest users. Your own traffic would have priority. A mechanism for opting out will be provided if and when this feature is launched.

Technical Support Policy
========================

The function of the [Sonic.net](https://www.sonic.com/), LLC technical support staff is to assist customers with initial connection, Internet browser and email account setup. Support is only available for computers running recent versions of Macintosh or Windows operating systems. [Sonic.net](https://www.sonic.com/), LLC does not offer over-the-phone tech support for issues such as CGI programming, Linux use, your web site, or any other issue not directly related to your dialing software or to the basic functions of your web browser and email program. While at its discretion the support staff may sometimes assist our customers with non-connectivity or non-email issues, any such extra service is strictly 'added value' service and provision of such service does not obligate [Sonic.net](https://www.sonic.com/), LLC to continue to provide such service. [Sonic.net](https://www.sonic.com/), LLC also provides some online discussion groups (web forums) [here](https://forums.sonic.net/); these are an excellent resource and answers to many questions that lie outside of the [Sonic.net](https://www.sonic.com/), LLC support model may be found in these forums.

[Sonic.net](https://www.sonic.com/), LLC will use its best efforts to provide all services to get your computer connected to the Internet but can not be held responsible for hardware or software malfunctions or assist in servicing or repairing your equipment. In such cases, the technical support staff will gladly refer you to outside sources for assistance. Customers should have a copy of their current operating system available when calling technical support; there will be limits to the amount of assistance that technical support representatives can offer if you do not have a copy of your current operating system. [Sonic.net](https://www.sonic.com/), Inc. reserves the right to cease providing over-the-phone technical support to any customer.

Please call the [Sonic.net](https://www.sonic.com/), LLC tech support number at 1-707-547-3400 if you need assistance in the Santa Rosa calling area. If you are outside the Santa Rosa calling area, you can contact us at 1-888-766-4233. Technical support can also be reached via email at [support@sonic.net](mailto:support@sonic.net).

You are entitled to free assistance with setting up your connection, an Internet browser (Internet Explorer or Safari) and an email client (Windows live Mail, Microsoft Outlook, Thunderbird, or Apple Mail) on one computer. Support is only available for computers running recent versions of the Macintosh or Windows operating systems. We offer telephone technical assistance everyday, 8am-10pm (closed major holidays and from 2pm - 2:30pm on Fridays).
