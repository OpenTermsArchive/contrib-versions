#### J. Copyright-Infringing Content

Dailymotion prohibits any copyright-infringing content. The distribution of any content reproducing all or part of a work protected by a copyright without the authorization of the author or the person who holds the rights for this exploitation is indeed forbidden.

In particular, it is forbidden for our Users to post online any content including all or part of:

* Pre-existing music and/or songs (recordings, soundtracks of films, series, etc.);

* Written works (literary works, courses, press articles, poetry collections, etc.);

of which the User is not the author and for the distribution of which no necessary authorization has been obtained.

However, it should be noted that:

* The notion of ‘work’ is extremely broad. Indeed, originality of a work is the only condition to access copyright protection, without the merit of the work and/or its destination being relevant. Thus, the User must bear in mind that all content is potentially subject to copyright protection and therefore its exploitation must be authorized;
* The exploitation of a work that has fallen into the public domain may remain subject to certain requirements. However, note that:
    * It must always respect the moral rights (which remains even after entering the public domain), and
    * The exploitation of an adaptation and/or interpretation of the work that has fallen into the public domain remains subject to the authorization of the rights holders of the adaptation and/or interpretation concerned when these latter have not fallen into the public domain; and
* That certain uses of protected works may be possible without the authorization of their authors or of the person who holds the rights to such works when they fall within the scope of the exceptions to copyright and/or related rights provided for by the applicable laws and regulations (and in particular in France by articles L.122-5 L and L.211-3 of the Intellectual Property Code, as detailed in our Help Centre at the following address: [https://faq.dailymotion.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020018900-Exceptions-to-copyright](https://faq.dailymotion.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020018900-Exceptions-to-copyright)) which must always be interpreted strictly.

Any User who violates the rules set out above and/or encourages their violation is liable to the consequences set out in Section III. For more information on this type of content, you can read our dedicated article on our Help Center.

#### K. Content infringing other’s rights

Dailymotion prohibits the diffusion of any content that threatens, offends, and/or insults any person and/or infringes on their rights.  
In particular, our Users are prohibited from posting any content online:

Sexual harassment is the use, even if not repeated, of any form of serious pressure with the real or apparent aim of obtaining an act of a sexual nature, whether this is sought for the benefit of the perpetrator or for a third party;
2. Constituting any form of insult, and in particular:  
    • Using particularly vulgar or offensive language in an insulting manner towards one or more persons, or

For more information on this type of content, you can read the dedicated article on the Dailymotion Help Center.

#### **L. Any Other Content Violating Applicable Laws or Regulations**

  
Prohibited Content shall also include any other content in violation of applicable laws and/or regulations.

### II) DETECTION AND REPORT OF PROHIBITED CONTENT

As a hosting service provider, Dailymotion has no general legal obligation to monitor the Content uploaded on the Dailymotion Service nor any general legal obligation to investigate facts or circumstances revealing illicit activities but must immediately remove or disable access to any illicit Content after being informed of its existence.

Dailymotion has therefore put in place detection and reporting tools allowing Dailymotion to be aware of the presence of Prohibited Content on the Dailymotion Service.  
The presence of Content that may violate the Prohibited Content Policy can be brought to Dailymotion attention by two means:

1. via the **automatic detection devices** set up on the Dailymotion Service (A) or;
2. via **Users’ reporting** through the **reporting tool** present near each video; (B) or through contacting Dailymotion **by e-mail or by letter** (C).

#### A. Automatic detection devices

The automatic detection device implemented by Dailymotion includes:

1. **List of keywords and short phrases**

Dailymotion has put in place a list of keywords and short phrases to prevent the uploading of Content that is clearly contrary to this Prohibited Content Policy. This list is updated every week and takes into account the “**Moderation Decisions**” made during the previous 6 months.

Thus, when uploading Content to the Service, if a word or short phrase in the comment, title or description of the video being uploaded is present in the above-mentioned list, the Content in question will be forwarded to our moderation team.  
The Restricted Mode may be applied to Video Content (as described in Section IV).

2. **Technologies for the protection of copyrighted content**

Dailymotion works with two providers of digital fingerprint recognition solutions: Audible Magic for audio detection and INA (Institut National de l’Audiovisuel) for video detection. Whenever a piece of video Content uploaded on the Dailymotion Service matches the digital fingerprint databases of our two providers, the video Content will be automatically removed.

Despite their high efficiency and their innovative character, these technologies require the collaboration of the concerned rightsholders, who must communicate their content to one and/or the other of these companies in order to create the associated digital fingerprints. Dailymotion is at the disposal of rightsholders to help them contact these societies, in order to prevent the future upload of content that the rightsholders have protected in this way.

#### B. The reporting tool for Prohibited Content

Dailymotion encourages its Visitors to report any Content that may violate the Prohibited Content Policy. These reports allow the Dailymotion Service to remain a safe space for everyone. This is the **fastest way for Visitors to report any Content** that they believe violates this Prohibited Content Policy. Our team reviews all reported Content 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

Regarding reports of copyright infringement, we remind you that certain uses of protected works may be permitted without the authorization of their authors or of the person who holds their rights when they fall within the scope of the exceptions to copyright and/or related rights provided for by the applicable laws and regulations (and in particular in France by articles L.122-5 L and L.211-3 of the Intellectual Property Code, as detailed in our Help Center at the following address:  
[https://faq.dailymotion.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020018900-What-are-the-exceptions-to-copyright-and-related-rights](https://faq.dailymotion.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020018900-What-are-the-exceptions-to-copyright-and-related-rights)).  
Before reporting any Content for copyright infringement, it is thus recommended to check whether the use of the protected work in question is permitted under one of these exceptions.  
Please note that reports of copyright infringement or infringement of other rights must be made by the owner of the rights concerned or by its duly authorized representative.

Regarding reports from **competent EU Member States Authorities in regards to the DSA application**, Dailymotion can process the requests in **English**, as a language broadly understood by a large number of EU citizens, as well as in **French**.

### III) CONSEQUENCES OF NON-COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROHIBITED CONTENT POLICY

#### A. Moderation actions applicable to the content

If Dailymotion is aware of the uploading of Prohibited Content on its Service, Dailymotion will apply a moderation action adapted to the nature of the Prohibited Content (“Moderation Action”).  
  
The applicable Moderation Actions may impact the:

1. Availability;
2. Visibility;
3. Accessibility to; or
4. Monetization of Content.

##### 1\. Moderation Action affecting the availability of Prohibited Content: removal of Content

Subject to the provisions below, any Prohibited Content will be removed from the Dailymotion Service as soon as Dailymotion is effectively aware of it.

##### 2\. Moderation Action affecting the visibility of Prohibited Content: restriction of the visibility of a video

Dailymotion may decide to restrict the visibility of a video and apply an age restriction to any Content which may offend the sensitivity of young audiences.  
This Moderation Action will have the effect of placing the video concerned in Restricted Mode.  
Such videos cannot (i) be viewed by Visitors having the Restricted Mode activated, (ii) appear in the results of their searches on the Dailymotion platform, nor (iii) be monetized or recommended by Dailymotion.

##### 3\. Moderation Action affecting the accessibility of Content: application of a geo-blocking measure

If the concerned Content violates a specific law/regulation in a given country or territory, Dailymotion can implement geo-blocking measures. These measures allow the Content to be made unavailable in a specific country or territories without altering its accessibility in other countries and/or territories.

##### 4\. Moderation action affecting the monetization of Content: video demonetization

Dailymotion reserves the right to demonetize video Content that is not suitable for advertising purposes.

#### B. Appealing a moderation decision

Dailymotion has established an internal appeal mechanism for the decisions taken by its moderation team following the detection and/or reporting of Prohibited Content (“Moderation Decision(s)”). This internal appeal system allows:

1. the author of a report to contest the Moderation Decision taken following his/her report; and
2. the User who has put Content online that has been subject to a Moderation Action mentioned in Section III. A of this Policy to contest the corresponding Moderation Decision.

This internal appeal mechanism is available by contacting our Support teams (see Section II.A.C.) or, in certain cases, via a URL link indicated in the e-mails sent by the moderation team to the author of the report or to the User who posted the Content online.  
This URL link redirects to an appeal form which must be filled in by providing all the mandatory information required to process such appeal.  
This appeal system is open for a period of 6 (six) months from the Moderation Decision.  
Dailymotion is committed to processing these appeals quickly and impartially.  
If the moderation team considers that the Content subject to the appeal is not illicit nor incompatible with this Prohibited Content Policy, the Content concerned will be maintained or made accessible and visible again on the Dailymotion Service.  
On the contrary, if the moderation team considers that the Content that is subject of the appeal is illegal or incompatible with this Prohibited Content Policy, a Moderation Action will be applied to the relevant Content.  
The author of the appeal will be informed of the outcome of the appeal as soon as possible via email sent to the address given on the appeal form.  
If you consider that a Moderation Decision goes against the law or if you consider yourself a victim of Content put online on the Dailymotion Service, legal recourses are at your disposal (such as filing a complaint or requests for summary proceedings).

#### **C.** Repeated Infringement Policy 

Dailymotion takes compliance with its [Prohibited Content Policy](https://legal.dailymotion.com/en/terms-of-use/#prohibited-content) and its [general Terms of Use](https://legal.dailymotion.com/en/terms-of-use/) very seriously in order to ensure a safe and respectful viewing environment for its Visitors, Users and Partners. 

Thus, there are [various procedures, measures and tools](https://legal.dailymotion.com/en/terms-of-use/#ii-detection-and-report-of-prohibited-content) that Dailymotion uses to enforce compliance with our [general Terms of Use](https://legal.dailymotion.com/en/terms-of-use/) and which might lead us to moderate content posted onto our Service. 

If you repeatedly post Content that violates this Prohibited Content Policy, we may restrict certain features associated with your Dailymotion Account or permanently disable your Dailymotion Account under this repeated infringer policy. Please note that additional specific terms are available [here](https://legal.dailymotion.com/en/copyright-repeated-infringement-policy/) in regards to copyright repeated infringements.

In a general manner, each Dailymotion Account has a penalty scoring system associated with it (the “**Counter**“). Such Counter is set up at zero by default, but any violation of our [Prohibited Content Policy](https://legal.dailymotion.com/en/terms-of-use/#prohibited-content) or of our [general Terms of Use](https://legal.dailymotion.com/en/terms-of-use/) will be accounted against the Dailymotion Account having performed such violation and will make the Counter increase. 

The number of penalty points given to a violation depends on the severity of the content that was removed and the context in which it was shared in order to ensure our violations’ accounting system is fair and proportionate (e.g.: hateful content will lead to more penalty points added to the Counter than spam for instance). Some violations such as, for example, terrorist content or child abuse content, will lead directly to the disabling of the corresponding Dailymotion Account, as further described in Section E below. 

The accounting of a violation to the Dailymotion Prohibited Content Policy or the Dailymotion general Terms of Use will last for a period of 90 (ninety) days, meaning that unless the Counter of a Dailymotion Account led to its deletion (as defined in the Section E below), a violation will no longer count towards the Counter of a Dailymotion Account after a period of 90 days.  

We remind you that you may always appeal every moderation decision taken by Dailymotion through the link that was provided to you in the email informing you of the moderation decision taken against your content. 

If an item of content you posted is restored due to an appeal, Dailymotion will take that restoration into consideration and the corresponding violation will no longer count towards the Counter of your Dailymotion Account. 

We are currently working on features that will enable us to increase the level of transparency around the measures taken for the safety of our platform, such as features allowing each User to follow the history of violations of our policies or of the Counter associated to a Dailymotion Account.

#### **D. Restricting features** 

The Counter linked to the violations performed by a given Dailymotion Account might lead to a restriction of the features linked to your account for a certain period of time or even the disabling of such Dailymotion Account at some point, as defined below. 

In addition to the Counter linked to a Dailymotion Account, Dailymotion may also take into consideration the weight of the violations to our policies compared to the activity of this account or of the corresponding User in general, and whenever possible the intention of the violation, in order to define the best and most proportionate sanction applicable. 

Several different sanctions might be applied for periods of up to several days if the Counter of a Dailymotion Account reaches a certain threshold, including :  

* Blocking the ability to upload Videos ont such Dailymotion Account; 
* Excluding Content posted on such Dailymotion Account from the [Dailymotion recommendation systems](https://legal.dailymotion.com/en/recommendation-tools-transparency/); 
* restricting the visibility of your Content posted on such Dailymotion Account;
* For Partners having the opportunity to monetize their Content, excluding the Content posted on such Dailymotion Account from monetization. 

Please note that Your Dailymotion Account might reach another restriction level as soon as your Counter changes as defined in Section C above. 

These restrictions generally only apply to the Dailymotion Account in connection of which the Counter has been calculated, but they may also be extended to other Dailymotion Accounts owned by the same User on the Dailymotion Service. 

In addition, Dailymotion might restrict the ability of a User to comment on Third Party Videos if the Counter associated to the User’s account is mainly due to comments in violation of the Dailymotion Prohibited Content Policy. 

Apart from the disabling of a Dailymotion Account, all the sanctions applied are temporary, meaning that all the restrictions applied will be lifted automatically at the end of the sanction duration announced in the email informing you of such account restriction decision. 

For sake of clarity, a restriction applied to a Dailymotion Account will continue until the notified end date of such sanction even if your Counter falls below the threshold in the meantime. 

We remind you that you may always appeal every moderation decision taken by Dailymotion through the link that was provided to you in the email informing you of such account restriction decision. 

#### **E. Disabling accounts** 

If the Counter of a Dailymotion Account reaches a critical level,  then such Dailymotion Account will be permanently disabled. 

Please note that some very severe violations of our [Prohibited Content Policy](https://legal.dailymotion.com/en/terms-of-use/#prohibited-content) or of our [general Terms of Use](https://legal.dailymotion.com/en/terms-of-use/) will lead to the direct disabling of the corresponding Dailymotion Account even if that’s the first time such account commits a violation. 

This sanction generally only applies to the Dailymotion Account in connection to which the Counter has been calculated, but it may also be extended to other Dailymotion Accounts owned by the same User on the Dailymotion Service. 

If you believe your Dailymotion Account has been deactivated by mistake, we remind you that you may always appeal every moderation decision taken by Dailymotion through the link that was provided to you in the email informing you of such account disabling decision. 

#### **F. Abusive reports** 

Dailymotion encourages its Visitors to [report any Content that may violate the Dailymotion Prohibited Content Policy](https://legal.dailymotion.com/en/terms-of-use/#ii-detection-and-report-of-prohibited-content).  

While we truly believe these reports allow the Dailymotion Service to remain a safe space for everyone, it is important to note that in some cases, unfounded reports might be considered abusive. 

Indeed, unfounded reports done repeatedly and/or reports reasonably suspected to be willfully made to harm the User having posted the reported Content for instance might lead to the refusal of Dailymotion to process the further reports you might make for a certain period of time. 

We remind you that you may always appeal every moderation decision taken by Dailymotion through the link that was provided to you in the email informing you of such reporting restriction. 

### IV) RESTRICTED MODE

“Restricted Mode” is a feature, activated by default, whose purpose is to limit the visibility of videos that may offend the sensibilities of certain Visitors and, in particular, young audiences.  
Visitors who have not deactivated the “Hide Sensitive Content” feature located at the bottom of the platform’s homepage will not be exposed to these videos, i.e. videos labelled as “Sensitive Content” (i) when they are uploaded by Users and/or (ii) in the context of a Moderation Action applied by Dailymotion, as mentioned in Section III.A.2.  
These videos cannot be viewed by Visitors who have the Restricted Mode activated and will not appear in their search results on the Dailymotion platform.

Any video whose access has been restricted will not be monetized or recommended by Dailymotion.

**APPENDIX B – Data Protection Annex**
--------------------------------------

Last Update of this DPA:

February 20, 2025

###   
**PREAMBLE**

When You make available Content on the Dailymotion Service, Your Content may include personal data of **third-parties** (e.g. images, voice recordings, names, etc.) (hereafter “**Third-Party Personal Data**”). Since You control the Content You make available on the Dailymotion Service, You alone determine the purposes and means of the Processing of Third-Party Personal Data that may be included therein.

The Processing of Third-Party Personal Data is governed by the Applicable Data Protection Laws, as defined below. It is explicitly confirmed that nothing in the present DPA shall be interpreted as extending the statutory scope of any of the Applicable Data Protection Laws and that the present DPA applies only to the extent necessary to ensure compliance with each of the Applicable Data Protection Laws.

The present Appendix (“**DPA**“) is applicable to the Processing of Third Party Personal Data included in Your Content, per which:

* You are the Data Controller (within the meaning of the Applicable Data Protection Law) for the Processing of such Third-Party Personal Data, and
* Dailymotion is Your Data Processor.

Note that if you act on behalf of a third party Data Controller, you are a Data Processor and Dailymotion is Your Sub-Processor.

We remind you that as a Data Controller, it is Your responsibility to Process Third Party Personal Data in conformity with the Applicable Data Protection Laws and in particular, to establish the existence of a legal basis applicable to the Processing of Third-Party Personal Data incorporated in Your Content, be it consent, legitimate interest, contract, or another legally recognized legal basis. **In the absence of such valid legal basis, making available on our Service any Content that incorporates Third-Party Personal Data constitutes an infringement of our Prohibited Content Policy** (Appendix A).

In using the Dailymotion Service, You accept the DPA as binding on You, and acknowledge that it applies to the Processing of Third-Party Personal Data by Dailymotion as Your Data Processor in relation to the Content that You make available on our Service. If You do not agree with the terms of this DPA, then do not upload, post or otherwise make available Content on the Dailymotion Service.

Note that, in addition to the Processing of Third-Party Personal Data as Your Data Processor, Dailymotion processes other categories of Your personal data during Your use of our Service, and that regardless of whether You are a Viewer, Account Applicant, User or Partner. While Processing Your personal data (other than the Third-Party Personal Data described above) (i) Dailymotion is not Your Data Processor but the Data Controller, and (ii) such Processing of Your personal data is not governed by this DPA but is described in our [Privacy Policy](https://legal.dailymotion.com/en/privacy-policy/).

You and Dailymotion may be individually referred to herein as “**Party**” or collectively as the “**Parties**“.

###   
**1\. Context**

You are the Data Controller of the Third-Party Personal Data that may be incorporated into Your Content. In this capacity, You retain full control over such Third-Party Personal Data. By uploading Your Content on our Service, and using the available Content management features, You (acting as Data Controller) instruct Dailymotion (acting in its capacity as Data Processor) to process the Third-Party Personal Data by hosting the Content and providing to You with content management and communication tools.

If You act on behalf of a different Data Controller, You are a Data Processor and Dailymotion is a Sub-Processor. In such a case, any references to Data Controller and Data Processor in this DPA shall be updated accordingly.

###   
**2\. Definitions**

In this DPA, capitalized terms and phrases have the meanings indicated below, which are applicable to both the singular and the plural thereof.

In particular, any reference to Personal Data shall include reference to Personal Information as the latter is defined under the CCPA.

“**Processing**” means the Third-Party Personal Data processing entrusted to Dailymotion and described in Section 3 of this DPA.

“**Sub-Processor**” has the definition attributed to it in the GDPR, and in this case means specifically any Sub-Processor engaged by Dailymotion (or any of their Sub-Processors) who, receives from Dailymotion any Third-Party Personal Data exclusively intended for carrying out data Processing operations entrusted by You under the present DPA.

You confirm and warrant that confining to us Processing of Third-Party Personal Data included in Your Content is in compliance with the Applicable Data Protection Laws, and, in particular, that You (or the Data Controller You act on behalf of) have established a valid legal basis therefor (ex. consent, contract, legitimate interest, etc.).

You authorize and instruct Dailymotion to proceed with the Processing of the Third-Party Personal Data on Your behalf to the extent necessary to provide the Processing Services (as defined below) and pursuant to the conditions established in the DPA or as otherwise authorized under the Applicable Data Protection Laws.

Dailymotion shall keep a record of all the Processing activities carried out on Your behalf, in compliance with its legal obligations.

Furthermore, each Party undertakes to comply with all legal obligations imposed on it pursuant to the Applicable Data Protection Laws.

####   
**3.1. Purposes of the Processing and Description of the Processing Services**

##### **3.1.a. Purposes of the Processing**

As a User of the Dailymotion Service, You make Content available on the Dailymotion Service, and such Content may incorporate Third-Party Personal Data.

Dailymotion processes Third-Party Personal Data in order to enable You to use the Dailymotion Service and, in particular, store and communicate Your Content using our Service features.

By uploading Content onto the Dailymotion Service, You may use the Dailymotion Service’s technical features for the following purposes:

* Storing Your Content, and consequently Third-Party Personal Data that may be incorporated within Your Content, on the Dailymotion Service;
* Making Your Content (and any associated Third-Party Personal Data) available to the public;
* Managing the availability to the public of the Third-Party Personal Data incorporated in Your Content, by using the content management tools available on our Service (ex. deciding to place the Content under public or private mode) and Service features (ex. content recommendation, content-categorization, etc.).

Dailymotion does not collect Third-Party Personal Data nor has any prior knowledge of the presence of Third-Party Personal Data within Your Content.

##### **3.1.b. Description of the Processing Services** – Your Instructions

You instruct Dailymotion to operate the following services (“**Processing Services**”) on Your behalf:

* Hosting of Your Content on the Dailymotion Service (this includes both the video files and associated metadata) on the servers owned by Dailymotion or provided by Dailymotion’s data hosting and other service providers (ex. cloud storage providers), i.e. our Sub-Processors;
* Making available the Video Player for the distribution of Your Content to the public;
* Making available technical tools allowing You to manage Your Content and, in particular, if you choose so, to make Your Content available to public, including through content recommendation tools.

Dailymotion shall process the Third-Party Personal Data in compliance with the Applicable Data Protection Laws, for the above-listed purposes and pursuant to the instructions of the Data Controller stipulated in the present DPA. You can provide additional instructions either by using the available technical tools and features of the Dailymotion Service or by addressing them directly to us through Dailymotion’s Help Center. Note that in the event Your instructions are incompatible with the way the Dailymotion Service operates or are in violation of the Terms or any other Dailymotion policies, Dailymotion will not be obliged to comply with such instructions, but You may stop the Processing by removing Your Content or ceasing to use our Service.

#### **3.2. Duration of the Processing**

The Processing of Third-Party Personal Data is undertaken on a continuous basis and will last until Your Content is removed for any reason whatsoever from the Dailymotion Service (ex. closure of Your Account, deletion of Your Content by You, or deletion of Your Content by Dailymotion pursuant to the present Terms). Note that despite the removal (i.e. unavailability of Your Content) for technical reasons related to the Dailymotion Service the video files and/or metadata associated with Your Content may remain in our systems for up to 1 month. Longer retention periods of Your Content or of its specific elements (ex. metadata) may be applied if required or authorized under applicable laws (ex. Content removed following a moderation decision is retained or a period of 12 months) and, in particular, if necessary to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.

####   
**3.3. Categories of Data Subjects**

The Data Subjects of this Processing are individuals whose Third-Party Personal Data is incorporated into Your Content.

####   
**3.4. Categories of Third-Party Personal Data**

The categories of Third-Party Personal Data processed depend on what Your Content (including associated metadata) contains. They may include any data that You decide to include in Your Content and which identifies or allows the identification of the Data Subjects such as their image (still or animated), voice, name, or any other personal information. You agree not to include so-called special categories of Personal Data in Your Content.

###   
**4\. Security and Confidentiality of Third-Party Personal Data**

Dailymotion has implemented and shall maintain adequate physical and organizational measures necessary to preserve the security of the Third-Party Personal Data integrated within Your Content (ex. aimed at preventing unintended destruction, loss, distortion, damage or unauthorized access to such Third-Party Personal Data). These measures are adapted to the level of the risk presented by the Processing. Nevertheless, we remind You that the Dailymotion Service is not a storage service and that You should take all necessary precautions to backup and preserve Your Content. Dailymotion does not assume any liability for the loss of the said files.

Dailymotion undertakes to implement the following **organizational measures** and ensures their respect by its staff and its Sub-Processors :

* ensure that the persons authorized to process Third-Party Personal Data or otherwise involved in the delivery of the Services are aware of, trained and organized to provide sufficient guarantees of security and confidentiality with respect to Third-Party Personal Data; and
* implement access and authorization management rules such as:
    * centralized management of access rights,
    * gradation of access and use rights,
    * periodic reviews.
* take all reasonable steps to prevent the misappropriated or fraudulent use of processed Third-Party Personal Data.

In addition, the main **technical measures** currently implemented by Dailymotion are as follows:

* network segmentation and filtering between zones,
* multi-factor authentication,
* event log, collection and centralization of logs,
* anti-virus,
* management of security patches,
* security / flow encryption (SSL),
* Internal PKI,
* Encryption of data in transit and at rest,

* application of anonymization and pseudonymization techniques (ex. tokenization, aggregation, hashing, etc.),
* periodic re-certification of accounts (periodic review of access rights),
* peer-to-peer code review (development methodology),
* periodic security audits (architecture, configuration, code, intrusion tests, etc.).

Dailymotion will cooperate with You, should You choose to notify the Supervisory Authority or an affected Data Subjects of the Third-Party Personal Data Breach. Please note that the competent Supervisory Authority under this DPA is the CNIL.

Furthermore, Dailymotion undertakes to provide You with all reasonable assistance in order to help You in respecting Your obligations regarding the security of the Third-Party Personal Data. You understand and agree that the reasonable costs of our assistance, if any, will be at Your expense.

###   
**5\. Sub-Processors**

#### **5.1. General Information**

You authorize Dailymotion to use the services of any Sub-Processor listed in Section 5.2. below. Dailymotion is committed to communicate any information related to a new Sub-Processor by updating these Terms or by other reasonable means of communication (ex. making such list available on the Dailymotion website). Dailymotion’s contracts with its Sub-Processors shall contain commitments at least as strict as those provided for in this DPA. If You object to a Sub-Processor, You can, at any time, terminate the Processing by deleting Your Content from our Service and/or ceasing the use of our Service. Continuous ongoing use of our Service indicates your acceptance of a new Sub-Processor.

####   
**5.2. List of Current Sub-Processors**

As any other company, in order to provide You our Service, Dailymotion outsources some of its activities to third-party service providers. As a result, the Third-Party Personal Data may be processed by our services providers acting in their capacity of Your Sub-Processors.

A list of Dailymotion’s Sub-Processors is accessible [here](https://legal.dailymotion.com/en/list-of-dailymotion-data-processors/).

### **6\. Data Subjects Rights**

As a Data Controller, it is Your responsibility to inform Data Subjects about the details of the Processing operations and to respond to their requests relating to the exercise of privacy rights (such as: right to information, access, rectification,  erasure, restriction of processing, objection and portability) they benefit from under the Applicable Data Protection Laws (“**Data Subject Request**”).

In this regard:

* Dailymotion shall:

– Communicate to You, as soon as possible, any Data Subject Request received by us (except where such communication is prohibited by the competent authorities); and

– Assist You, by all appropriate and reasonable measures, in fulfilling Your obligation to comply with the Data Subject Requests. Note that Dailymotion reserves the right to charge You for all reasonable costs and expenses related to assisting You with such requests.

* You hereby instruct Dailymotion, acing on Your behalf, to:

– Receive Data Subject Requests;

– Proceed with the verification of whether a received request is a valid Data Subject Request under the Applicable Data Protection Laws, and in particular:

– proceed with the reasonable verification of requestors’ identity; including, when necessary, through the verification of their IDs;

– request from Data Subjects any addition information or documents reasonably necessary for that verification;

– Not to reply to Data Subject Requests on Your behalf other than by informing Data Subjects about the applicable procedures and, in particular, You being the Data Controller responsible for answering Data Subject Requests and Dailymotion being Your Data Processor whose role is limited to that of an intermediary between a requestor (i.e. a Data Subject) and You (i.e. the Data Controller);

– Transfer Your replies to Data Subjects and receive their communication addressed to You and that, in particular, when Data Subjects do not wish to provide their contact details to You.

* You shall:

* all instructions You transmit to Dailymotion regarding the Processing of Third-Party Personal Data, as described in the present DPA and, in particular, in its Section 3.1. are in conformity with the Applicable Data Protection Laws and, if You act in capacity of a Data Processor for another Data Controller, are compatible with any instructions You have received from such Data Controller. In particular, You warrant that You have been authorized to designate us as a Data Sub-Processor;
* the Third-Party Personal Data has been collected and is processed in compliance with the Applicable Data Protection Law;
* You have obtained the consent of the Data Subjects or have established an alternative legal basis for the collection and Processing of the said Third-Party Personal Data and You undertake to produce evidence of such consent or legal basis upon a request from Dailymotion, the Data Subjects and/or competent authorities.

To that end, You undertake to defend and indemnify Dailymotion against any and all claims, costs, fines, reasonable attorney fees, or other expenses incurred in relation to the availability on our Service of Your Content integrating Third-Party Personal Data.

### **8\. Audits and Public Authorities Requests**

#### 8.1 Audit Requests

To the extent the Processing is subject to the EU Data Protection Law, as a Data Controller, You have a right to audit the Processing activities undertaken by Dailymotion as Your Data Processor within the limitations set forth in this Section.

If You reasonably believe that Dailymotion does not respect one of its specific obligations as Your Data Processor, You may request an audit by submitting a description of this specific suspected failure and an audit request to Dailymotion, using the contact details listed in Section 10 of this DPA. As part of the audit, Dailymotion undertakes to provide You with the information in its possession and strictly necessary to demonstrate the respect of Dailymotion’s obligations as Your Data Processor under this DPA, subject to the respect of Third-Parties’ rights and the security requirements of Dailymotion’s IT systems.

For sake of clarity, You shall not be entitled to receive any information outside of this limited scope of the requested audit. You may request such audit not more often than once per thirty-six (36) months’ period and under the condition that You inform Dailymotion at the latest sixty (60) working days before its planned starting date. Such audit must be performed by an external, qualified and independent third-party auditor at Your expense at Dailymotion’s headquarters and during normal business hours and must be limited to two business days (unless the circumstances do not reasonably allow it to be completed within such time). The auditor must be subject to strict contractual obligations of confidentiality, and the results of such audit must also be treated as confidential information and must be shared with Dailymotion. Dailymotion may object in writing to an auditor appointed by You if the auditor is, in Dailymotion’s reasonable opinion, not sufficiently qualified or independent, a competitor of Dailymotion, or otherwise manifestly unsuitable. Any such objection by Dailymotion will require You to appoint another auditor.

If the audit reveals a non-respect of Dailymotion’s obligations, Dailymotion will take reasonable measures to remedy it or cease the Processing of Your Content. If You are not satisfied with the result of such audit, You may exercise Your right to stop or suspend the use of the Dailymotion Service.

Furthermore, You agree that if during the twenty-four (24) months preceding Your audit request, the matter of Your request has already been subject to another audit initiated by Dailymotion or by a third-party, the sharing of such audit’s results with You will satisfy Dailymotion’s audit obligation under the present Section.

#### 8.2 Public Authorities Requests

In its role as a Data Processor, Dailymotion shall maintain appropriate measures to protect Third-Party Personal Data in accordance with the requirements of applicable data protection Laws and regulations, including by implementing appropriate technical and organizational safeguards to protect Third-Party Personal Data against any interference that goes beyond what is necessary in a democratic society to safeguard national security, defense and public security.

If Dailymotion receives a legally binding request to provide Third-Party Personal Data to a Public Authority, Dailymotion shall, unless otherwise legally prohibited, promptly notify You and provide You with a summary of the nature of the request. Dailymotion may challenge the request if, after careful assessment, it concludes that there are reasonable grounds to consider that the request is unlawful and may pursue possibilities of appeal and/or seek interim measures with a view to suspending the effects of the request until the competent judicial authority had decided on its merits. It shall not disclose the Third-Party Personal Data requested until required to do so under the applicable procedural rules. Dailymotion agrees it will provide the minimum amount of information permissible when responding to a request for disclosure, based on a reasonable interpretation of the request. For the avoidance of doubt, this DPA shall not require Dailymotion to pursue action or inaction that could result in civil or criminal penalty for Dailymotion such as contempt of court.

**9\. Transfers of **Third-Party Personal Data****

#### 9.1. Description of Transfers of Third-Party Personal Data

* **Operation of the Dailymotion Servic**e:

Dailymotion Service is operated by companies belonging to the Dailymotion group, some of which are located outside the EEA. When your Content includes Third-Party Personal Data, non-EEA Dailymotion entities may process such Personal Data outside the EEA, namely in the USA, Singapore or other territories they operate from. In particular, if Your video containing Third Party Personal data is available in the USA, it is Dailymotion Inc’s USA-based content moderation team that will analyze it if it receives a notification of it allegedly infringing character.

Note that Dailymotion Inc. participates in the Data Privacy Framework. Any transfer of Third-Party Personal Data to Dailymotion Inc. relies on that DPF participation. In the event of either, Dailymotion’s Inc. discontinuing its DPF participation or invalidation of the DPF, any such transfer shall rely on the 2021 SCC, as further detailed hereinbelow.

* **Storage and Content Delivery**:
    
    * **Comments**: o depending on the territory you access the Dailymotion Service from, You may have a possibility to comment Content available on our Service. In addition to them being stored in the EEA Your Comments may be stored in the USA on servers used by our service provider assisting us in operating the comment feature. Consequently, if your Comments contain Third-Party Personal Data, that data is transferred to the USA.
    
    * **Other Content**: o Dailymotion stores Content (other than Comments) in the EEA either directly (on servers owned by Dailymotion) or through intermediary of its services providers (cloud-storage service providers). If You decide to render Your video Content available outside of the EEA, for technical reasons inherent to video-delivery technology, a temporary cache copies of extracts of Your video Content may also be stored outside of the EEA. A cache copy is created on servers close to a viewer. Its creation is inherent to video-delivery technology and serves to reduce the latency, i.e. enables a viewer to see a video faster by shortening the time between the request to see a video and the appearance of that video on the viewer’s screen. When Your Content includes Third-Party Personal Data, creation of cache copies of extracts of Your Content on non-EEA servers may result in a transfer of such Personal Data outside the EEA (if the actual copies of extracts contain Third-Party Personal Data).
* **Service Features**: Dailymotion Service enables various Content related features, ex. statistics, customer support, content search or recommendation. The data thus processed is stored on servers owned by Dailymotion and by our services providers (ex. cloud-storage service providers) listed in clause 5.2. above, and is analyzed using Dailymotion’s and our service providers’ tools. When Your Content includes Third-Party Personal Data, use of Content related features may result in transfer of such Personal Data outside the EEA. For example, if the title of Your Video that You rendered available in the USA includes somebody’s else name, the content search tool using USA-based resources will process that Personal Data.  
    

#### 9.2. Legal Tools Applicable to the Transfer of Third-Party Personal Data

##### 9.2.1. Transfer of Third-Party Personal Data from You to Dailymotion

        * If You are established in any other territory:  Dailymotion Inc., 150 W 22nd Street, Floor 12, New York, NY 10011, USA, contact details: [legal@dailymotion.com](mailto:legal@dailymotion.com);
    
    * For the purpose of the UK GDPR, the local representative of Dailymotion is : The DPO Centre Ltd, 50 Liverpool street, London, EC2M 7PY, UK, +44 (0) 203 797 6340, [advice@dpocentre.com](mailto:advice@dpocentre.com).
    
    * Data importer role: Processor or Sub-Processor if data exporter is a Processor.

For transfers from the EEA:

* Module Two applies where You (data exporter) are a Controller and Dailymotion (data importer) is a Processor,
    
    * Module Three applies where You (data exporter) are a Processor of a third-party Data Controller and Dailymotion (data importer) is a Processor;
    
    * in Clause 7, the optional docking clause does not apply;
* in Clause 9(a) of Module Three, option 2 applies, and the time period for prior notice of Sub-processor changes is 14 days;
* in Clause 11(a), the optional language does not apply;
* in Clause 17, Option 1 applies with the governing law being that of France;
* in Clause 18(b), disputes will be resolved before the courts in Paris, France;
* Annex I of the 2021 SCCs and parties activities are completed with the information in Section 3 of the DPA;

* For transfers from **Switzerland**: where a transfer to a Third Country is made from Switzerland, the 2021 SCCs incorporated into this DPA, as modified in Section 9, apply to the transfer except that:
* in Clause 13, the competent Supervisory Authority is the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner if the transfer is governed by the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection; and
* references to “Member State” in the 2021 SCCs refer to Switzerland, and data subjects located in Switzerland may exercise and enforce their rights under the 2021 SCCs in Switzerland; and
* references to the “General Data Protection Regulation”, “Regulation 2016/679” and “GDPR” in the 2021 SCCs refer to the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (as amended or replaced).

* For transfers from the UK: where a transfer to a Third Country is made from the UK, the UK Addendum is incorporated into this DPA and applies to the transfer as follows: the UK Addendum is completed with the information in Sections 3, 4 and 5.2 of this DPA; and both “Importer” and “Exporter” are selected in Table 4.

The acceptance of  the Terms constitutes mutual acceptance and  signature of the 2021 SCC, incorporated in the present DPA,  and their annexes.

##### 9.2.2. Transfer of Third-Party Personal Data from Dailymotion to Sub-Processors

In the event that Dailymotion transfers Third-Party Personal Data to a Third Country through a third-party Sub-Processor, Dailymotion will ensure that such transfer takes place only in the presence of legally adequate safeguards such as, for example, integration of the 2021 SCC within contracts concluded with such Sub-Processors, obtaining a commitment from such Sub-Processors to enter into 2021 SCC with their own Sub-Processors (if any).

When the Personal Data is transferred from the EEA, the UK or Switzerland to an US data importer participating in the “Data Privacy Framework” (or any replacement thereof.) such transfer relies on that data importer’s participation in the DPF.

##### 9.2.3. Transfer Assessment

As of the last update of the Terms, Dailymotion has conducted an assessment of the applicable laws and regulations or practices of the Third Countries of destination where the Processing of Third-Party Personal Data may occur.

Dailymotion is designed as a video-sharing platform, meaning that the videos which may contain Third Party Personal Data are public by default, and therefore accessible to anyone.

Taking into account the categories of Third-Party Personal Data and the purposes Dailymotion process that Data on Your behalf, Dailymotion has no reason to believe that the laws and practices in any Third Country of destination applicable to the Processing of Third Party Personal Data, including any requirements to disclose Third Party Personal Data or measures authorizing access by a Public Authority (e.g. a government agency, or law enforcement authority, including judicial authorities), prevent Dailymotion from fulfilling its obligations under this DPA. However, if Dailymotion reasonably believes that any existing or future enacted or enforceable laws and practices in a Third Country of destination applicable to the Processing prevent it from fulfilling its obligations under this DPA and may represent a threat to Third Party Personal Data’s security and integrity, it shall promptly notify its Users, including You, and it will use reasonable efforts to make available to the affected Users a change in the Services. If Dailymotion is unable to make available such change, You may remove Your Content at any time from the Dailymotion Service.

As such, Dailymotion has determined that the risks of infringing such Third-Party’s  privacy associated to such transfer to a Third Country is limited and consequently, that the existing measures in place shall be sufficient to ensure the efficiency of the protection of the rights of the data subjects whose Third Party Personal Data is related to.

### 10\. **Further Processing of Third Party Personal Data by Dailymotion**

As part of the operation of the Dailymotion Service, Dailymotion analyses and further processes data related to the Service features and content hosted thereon. To the extent thus analyzed data is Your Content that comprises Third Party Personal Data, such use of data may constitute Processing of Third Party Personal Data by Dailymotion. 

Dailymotion may further Process Third Party Personal Data present in Your Content, as Controller, for purposes that are compatible with the initial processing purposes, namely:

* Improvement of the Services;  

* Market studies; 

* Fraud detection, Service misuse detection, Service security and legal compliance;
