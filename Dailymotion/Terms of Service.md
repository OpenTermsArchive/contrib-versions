1.2. By accessing and/or using the Dailymotion Service, without being logged into a Dailymotion Account**, You ("You" or "Your" as applicable) will be hereinafter a “Viewer.” As a Viewer, You will only have the ability to access, view or share videos available on the Dailymotion Service, but will not be able to benefit from all the other features available on the Dailymotion Service.** A “**Dailymotion Account**” means the video content storage space on the Dailymotion Service which is dedicated to a User (as defined below) on the Dailymotion Service that can be created by signing up for a Dailymotion Account via [www.dailymotion.com](http://www.dailymotion.com/).

1.3. If You want to be able to upload videos and access some other features of the Dailymotion Service, You will need to first create a Dailymotion Account and have Your email address validated (see Section 1.4.) at which point You will be a “**User**.” Note however that after having created Your Dailymotion Account and until You have validated Your email address according to the process defined below, You will be an “**Account Applicant**” and will not be able to upload videos or access the other features of the Dailymotion Service.

You agree to immediately notify Dailymotion of any unauthorized use of Your User ID, password or any other breach of Your Dailymotion Account security.

1.6. As a User, You will also have the ability to access some additional features from the Dailymotion Service, and if and when You have accepted the terms of the Dailymotion Partner Program, You will then be a “**Partner**” and will have the opportunity to monetize Your Content uploaded on Your Dailymotion Account.

**3.1.a. Purposes of the Processing**

Dailymotion operates the Dailymotion Service. The Data Controller is a User of the Dailymotion Service who uploads Content onto the Dailymotion Service which incorporates Third-Party Personal Data. **In any case, Dailymotion is not collecting this Third-Party Personal Data and has no prior knowledge of the presence of any Third-Party Personal Data within Your Content.**

As such, You are the Data Controller of this Third-Party Personal Data, and You will ensure that You have a legal basis to process the Third-Party Personal Data incorporated in Your Content (ex. consent, legitimate interest, etc.). Dailymotion shall process the Third-Party Personal Data in compliance with the Applicable Data Protection Laws and for the below-mentioned purposes, according to the instructions of the Data Controller stipulated in the present DPA. Additional instructions regarding the Processing of such Third-Party Personal Data can be provided by You either by using the available technical tools and features of the Dailymotion Service or by addressing them directly to us through Dailymotion's Help Center. Note that in the event Your instructions are incompatible with the way the Dailymotion Service operates or are in violation of the Terms or any other Dailymotion policies, Dailymotion will not be obliged to comply with such instructions, but You may stop the Processing by removing such Content.

Dailymotion has in place and shall maintain adequate physical and organizational measures necessary to preserve the security of the Third-Party Personal Data integrated within the Content (ex. aimed at preventing destruction, loss, distortion, damage or unauthorized access to such Third-Party Personal Data). These measures are adapted to the level of the risk presented by the Processing. Nevertheless, we remind You that the Dailymotion Service is not a storage service and that You should take all necessary precautionary measures for the backup and preservation of Your video files. Dailymotion does not assume any liability for the loss of the said files in accordance with Section 5 and 6 of the Terms.

Nonetheless, Dailymotion undertakes to implement the following **organizational measures** and to make its staff and its Sub-Processors respect them:

*   ensure that the persons authorized to process Third-Party Personal Data or otherwise involved in the delivery of the Services are aware of, trained and organized to provide sufficient guarantees of security and confidentiality with respect to Third-Party Personal Data; and
*   implement access and authorization management rules such as the following:
    *   centralized management of access rights,
    *   gradation of access and use rights,
    *   periodic reviews.
*   take all reasonable steps to prevent the misappropriated or fraudulent use of processed Third-Party Personal Data.

In addition, the main **technical measures** currently implemented by Dailymotion (some of which are specifically applicable for the protection of Third-Party Personal Data) are as follows:

*   network segmentation and filtering between zones,

Dailymotion commits to cooperating with You should You choose to notify the Supervisory Authority or an affected Data Subject of the Third-Party Personal Data Breach.

Furthermore, Dailymotion undertakes to provide You with all reasonable assistance in order to help You in respecting Your obligations regarding the security of the Third-Party Personal Data provided for by the Applicable Data Protection Law. You understand and agree that the reasonable costs of such assistance from Dailymotion, if any, will be at Your expense.

  
**5\. Sub-Processors**

**6\. Data Subjects Rights**

As a Data Controller, it is Your responsibility to respond to the requests of the Data Subjects relating to the exercise of their privacy rights under applicable law and to inform the Data Subjects about the details of the Processing operations and that, at the latest at the time of collection of the Third-Party Personal Data or prior to any further Processing of the Third-Party Personal Data.

In this regard, Dailymotion shall:

*   Communicate to You, as soon as possible, any request for deletion, correction, communication, access to the Third-Party Personal Data or limitation of the Processing of the Third-Party Personal Data, except where this communication is prohibited by the applicable authorities; and
*   Assist You, by all appropriate and reasonable measures, in fulfilling Your obligation to comply with the requests of Data Subjects. Note that Dailymotion reserves the right to charge You for all reasonable costs and expenses related to assisting You with such requests.

Further, in this regard, You agree:

*   That Dailymotion will communicate with You on the email address associated with Your User Account and/or another email address that has been designated by You to Dailymotion's DPO;
*   That Dailymotion may share this email address and/or any other contact information provided within Your account (ex. the postal address) with the Data Subjects as the contact address of the Data Controller. Should You wish to designate any contact information different from what is in Your User Account, You should do so by contacting Dailymotion's DPO;
*   That You shall respond to requests from Data Subjects within the timeframes set forth in the Applicable Data Protection Law;
*   That You shall notify Dailymotion -- by replying to the notification sent by Dailymotion as described in this Section – of Your response to each of the Data Subjects requests including, if applicable, whether You invoked an extension of the time to respond. In the absence of such a notification from You within the timelines prescribed by law, then You authorize Dailymotion to proceed with the removal of Your Content from the Dailymotion Service. However, in the event that the Data Subjects claims that Your Content contains sensitive and/or special Third-Party Personal Data (as defined under Applicable Laws) or the Third-Party Personal Data of a minor, You authorize Dailymotion to proceed to the immediate removal of access to the Content without waiting for Your response (though removal may be reversed depending on Your response). Note that this process is separate and in addition to any other content removal process described under the Terms (ex. removal of Your Content because it violates copyright law).

  
**7\. Your Representations and Warranties**

You represent and warrant to Dailymotion that:

*   You have obtained and will maintain for the duration of Your use of the Dailymotion Service all rights and authorizations necessary to allow us to provide You with the Dailymotion Services;
*   All instructions You transmit to Dailymotion regarding the Processing of Third-Party Personal Data, as described under Section 3.1.a. are not in violation with the Applicable Data Protection Laws and, if You act in capacity of a Data Processor for another Data Controller, are compatible with any instructions You have received from such Data Controller. In particular, You shall ensure that You have been authorized to designate us as a Data Sub-Processor;
*   the Third-Party Personal Data has been collected in compliance with the Applicable Data Protection Law;
*   You have obtained the consent of the Data Subjects or have established an alternative legal basis for the collection of said Third-Party Personal Data and You undertake to produce evidence of such consent or legal basis upon a request from Dailymotion, the Data Subjects and/or competent authorities.

  
**8\. Audit Requests**

As a Data Controller, You have a right to audit the Processing activities undertaken by Dailymotion as a Data Processor within the limitations set forth in this Section.

If You reasonably believe that Dailymotion does not respect one of its specific obligations as Your Data Processor, You may request an audit by submitting a description of this specific suspected failure and audit request to Dailymotion, using the contact details listed in Section 10 of this DPA. As part of the audit, Dailymotion undertakes to provide You with the information in its possession and strictly necessary to demonstrate the respect of Dailymotion's obligations as Your Data Processor as defined under this DPA and the Applicable Data Protection Laws subject to the respect of Third-Parties' rights and the security requirements of Dailymotion's computer systems.

For sake of clarity, You shall not be entitled to receive any information outside of this limited scope in relation to this audit right. You may request such audit not more often than once per thirty-six (36) month period and under the condition that You inform Dailymotion at the latest sixty (60) working days before its planned starting date. Such audit must be performed by an external third-party auditor at Your expense at Dailymotion's headquarters and during normal business hours and must be limited to two business days (unless the circumstances do not reasonably allow it to be completed within such time). The auditor must be subject to strict contractual obligations of confidentiality, and the results of such audit must also be treated as confidential information and must be shared with Dailymotion. Dailymotion may object in writing to an auditor appointed by You to conduct any audit if the auditor is, in Dailymotion's reasonable opinion, not suitably qualified or independent, a competitor of Dailymotion, or otherwise manifestly unsuitable. Any such objection by Dailymotion will require You to appoint another auditor.

If the audit reveals a non-respect of Dailymotion's obligations, Dailymotion will take reasonable measures to remedy it. Furthermore, if You are not satisfied with the result of such audit, You may always exercise Your right to at any time, stop or suspend the use of the Dailymotion Service.

Furthermore, You agree that if during the twenty-four (24) months preceding Your audit request, the subject of Your audit request has already been subject to another audit initiated by Dailymotion or by a third-party, the sharing of such audit's results with You will satisfy Dailymotion's audit obligation to You as described in the present Section.

  
**9\. Third-Party Personal Data Transfers outside the European Union**

If, during the provision of the Services, You are established in a Member State of the European Economic Area, Switzerland or the United Kingdom, the Third-Party Personal Data incorporated into Your Content are transferred to a Third Country as necessary to provide the Processing Services. Therefore, according to the Applicable Data Protection Law, the [Standard Contractual Clauses](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32010D0087&from=FR) are applicable to this transfer of Third-Party Personal Data by You (data exporter) to Dailymotion (data importer). It is agreed by the Parties that: (i) the description of the Processing as required under **Appendix 1** of the [Standard Contractual Clauses](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32010D0087&from=FR) is provided under Section 3 of the present DPA and (ii) the description of the technical and organizational security measures as required under **Appendix 2** of the [Standard Contractual Clauses](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32010D0087&from=FR) are provided under Section 4 of the present DPA. By accepting the Terms You accept the Standard Contractual Clauses and their appendices.

In the event that Dailymotion either directly or indirectly transfers Third-Party Personal Data to a Third Country through a third-party Sub-Processor (instead of Processing such Third-Party Personal Data itself), Dailymotion will ensure that such transfer is done only in the presence of legally adequate safeguards. For example, by integrating the Standard Contractual Clauses within such Sub-Processor's contract and/or by obtaining a commitment from such Sub-Processor to enter into Standard Contractual Clauses with its own Sub-Processors (if any).
