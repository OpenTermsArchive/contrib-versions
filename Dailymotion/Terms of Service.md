##### **C. OFFENSIVE CONTENTS FOR YOUNG AUDIENCES**

Dailymotion has elaborated rules and tools aiming at protecting young audiences from contents which may offend their sensibility. 

In this respect, Dailymotion has set up a parental filter on the Dailymotion website and applications. This parental filter is activated by default and prevents Visitors from being exposed to Content posted online with an age restriction. Thus, when the parental filter is activated, the Visitor will not be able to access or be exposed to this type of Content

Users are therefore prohibited from posting any Content that is inappropriate for young audiences without specifying whether such content is subject to an age restriction by checking the box provided for this purpose at the time of uploading. 

Any content that might offend the sensibilities of young audiences may not be posted without any age restriction and in particular content:

* Presenting partial nudity in a suggestive context;

The above list is not exhaustive.

Some of the contents evoking or dealing with one of the situations listed above can be **exceptionally** maintained on the Dailymotion Service notably because of their context. However, Dailymotion reserves the right to reduce the visibility of these contents by applying a parental filter to avoid offending the sensibility of young audiences

Any User who violates the rules set out above shall be subject to the measures and sanctions set out in Section 3.

Should any illegal activity(ies) be detected, Dailymotion will contact the relevant authorities in accordance with the applicable regulations.

##### **J. INFRINGING COPYRIGHT CONTENTS**

Dailymotion prohibits any content infringing copyrights. The distribution of any content reproducing all or part of a work protected by a copyright without the authorization of the author or the person who holds the rights for this exploitation is indeed forbidden. 

In particular, it is forbidden for our Users to post any content including all or part of : 

* Pre-existing music and/or songs (recordings, soundtracks of films, series, etc.);
* Audiovisual works (film, series, video clips, TV show, advertisement etc.),
* Dramatic works (play, opera, musical, performance and other live shows);
* Graphic and plastic works (painting, sculpture, photography, architecture, design, comics, manga, illustration, graffiti, digital creation, etc.);
* Video games;
* Written works (literary works, courses, press articles, poetry collections, etc.);

of which the User is not the author and for the distribution of which no necessary authorization has been obtained. 

However, it should be noted that:

* The notion of ‘work’ is extremely broad. Indeed, originality of a work is the only condition to access copyright protection, without the merit of the work and/or its destination being relevant. Thus, the User must bear in mind that all content is potentially subject to copyright protection and therefore its exploitation must be authorized.
* That the exploitation of a work that has fallen into the public domain may remain subject to certain requirements. Indeed : 
    
    * It must always respect the moral rights (which remains even after entering the public domain);
    
    * The exploitation of an adaptation and/or interpretation of the work that has fallen into the public domain remains subject to the authorization of the rights holders of the adaptation and/or interpretation concerned when these latter have not fallen into the public domain. 
* That certain uses of protected works may be possible without the authorization of their authors or of the person who holds the rights to such works when they fall within the scope of the exceptions to copyright and/or related rights provided for by the applicable laws and regulations (and in particular in France by articles L.122-5 L and L.211-3 of the Intellectual Property Code, as detailed in our Help Centre at the following address: https://faq.dailymotion.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020018900-Exceptions-to-copyright) which must always be interpreted strictly.

Any User who violates the rules set out above is liable to the consequences set out in Section 3.

For more information on this type of content, you can read the [dedicated article](https://faq.dailymotion.com/hc/en-us/articles/203657336-Report-a-copyright-infringement) on our Help Center.

##### **K. CONTENT INFRINGING OTHER’S RIGHTS**

Dailymotion prohibits the **diffusion of content infringing privacy, trademarks or including defamatory statements**. 

Any User who violates the rules set out above is subject to the consequences set out in Section III.

For more information on this type of content, you can read the dedicated article on the Dailymotion Help Center. 

### II) **DETECTION AND REPORT OF PROHIBITED CONTENT**

As a hosting service provider, Dailymotion has no general legal obligation to monitor the Content uploaded on the Dailymotion Service nor any general legal obligation to investigate facts or circumstances revealing illicit activities.  Nevertheless, Dailymotion must immediately remove or disable access to any illicit Content after being informed of its existence. 

Dailymotion has therefore put in place detection and reporting tools allowing to be aware of the presence of Prohibited Content on the Dailymotion Service.

The presence of Content that may violate the Prohibited Content Policy can be brought to Dailymotion attention by three means: 

via the automatic detection devices set up on the Dailymotion Service; (**A**)

via Users’ reporting through the reporting tool present near each video; (**B**) 

or through contacting Dailymotion by e-mail or by letter (**C**). 

#### A. **AUTOMATIC DETECTION DEVICES**

The automatic detection device implemented by Dailymotion include:  

**1\. List of key words and short sentences**

Dailymotion has put in place a list of keywords and short phrases that allow it to automatically detect and, if necessary, prevent the uploading of Content that is obviously in violation of this Prohibited Content Policy. Thus, when uploading Content to the Service, if a word or short phrase in the title or in the description of the video is listed, the Content in question will be forwarded to our moderation team. This list is updated weekly based on previous “Moderation Decisions”.

**2\. Technologies for the protection of copyrighted content**

Dailymotion works with two providers of digital fingerprint recognition solutions: Audible Magic for audio detection and INA (Institut National de l’Audiovisuel) for video detection. Each time a Content uploaded on the Dailymotion Service matches the digital fingerprint databases of our two providers, the Content will be automatically removed.

Despite their high efficiency and their innovative character, these technologies require the collaboration of the concerned rightsholders, who must communicate their content to one and/or the other of these companies in order to create the associated digital fingerprints. 

Dailymotion is at the disposal of rightsholders to help them contact these societies, in order to prevent the future uploading of content that the rightsholders have protected in this way.

#### B. **THE REPORTING TOOL FOR PROHIBITED CONTENT** 

Dailymotion encourages its Visitors to report any Content that may violate the Prohibited Content Policy. These reports allow the Dailymotion Service to remain a safe space for everyone. Please note that it is not necessary to have a Dailymotion account to report Prohibited Content. 

Reporting is the quickest way for Visitors to alert Dailymotion of any Content that they believe violates this Prohibited Content Policy. All reported Content is reviewed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by our dedicated team.

To report Content, you need to: 

1. Click on the “Report” button available near each video;
2. Specify whether the report concerns the entire video or only a specific extract (a time stamp is assigned by default but can be modified); 
3. Select the main motive for the report;
4. Describe in the dedicated  (free) text field any information that will allow Dailymotion to process the report;
5. Fill in your name and surname(s) as they appear on an official identity document issued by an administration as well as your e-mail address. This information will allow Dailymotion to inform the Visitor who has reported the Content of the follow-up given to the report.

In the event of a report of copyright infringement or infringement of other rights, the Visitor will be redirected to a dedicated form and must necessarily include the URL address of the reported video. Otherwise, Dailymotion will not be able to process the report.

The reporting forms specific to copyright infringement or other rights infringement are also available via this link.

Any report sent to Dailymotion through the reporting tool will be treated in accordance with the formalism required by French law. 

Any report based on another legislation, it must be submitted to Dailymotion by e-mail or by post in accordance with the provisions below.

#### **C. E-MAIL OR POSTAL REPORTS**

The presence of Content that may violate the Prohibited Content Policy may also be reported to Dailymotion by e-mail or by letter. In such case, all of the following elements shall be communicated to Dailymotion:

1) Depending on the status of the author of the report, the elements necessary to process the request will differ. If the author of the report is :

* A physical person: he/she must specify his/her name, first name(s) and e-mail address; 
* A legal person: the legal form and name of the legal person must be specified, as well as an e-mail address for the follow-up of the report;
* An administrative authority: the name of the administrative authority concerned must be specified, as well as an e-mail address for the follow-up of this report.

* If the report is made in the name of a third party, it is necessary to provide Dailymotion with all supporting documents attesting that the author of the report is duly authorized to represent this third party.

* The main motive for the report (by reference to the Categories of Prohibited Content described in Section I of this Policy);

No action will be taken on requests that do not include all the elements that would allow Dailymotion to process the report.

Regarding reports of copyright infringement, we remind you that certain uses of protected works may be permitted without the authorization of their authors or of the person who holds their rights when they fall within the scope of the exceptions to copyright and/or related rights provided for by the applicable laws and regulations (and in particular in France by articles L.122-5 L and L.211-3 of the Intellectual Property Code, as detailed in our Help Centre at the following address 

Before reporting any Content for copyright infringement, it is thus recommended to check whether the use of the protected work in question is not permitted under [one of these exceptions](https://faq.dailymotion.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020018900-What-are-the-exceptions-to-copyright-and-related-rights-).

Please note that reports of copyright infringement or infringement of other rights must be made by the owner of the rights concerned or by its duly authorized representative.

### III. **CONSEQUENCES OF NON-COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROHIBITED CONTENT POLICY**

#### A. **MODERATION ACTIONS APPLICABLE TO THE CONTENT**

If Dailymotion is aware of the uploading of a Prohibited Content on its Service, Dailymotion will apply a moderation 

action adapted to the nature of the Prohibited Content (“**Moderation Action**“).

The applicable Moderation Actions may impact:

* The availability ; (**1**.) 
* The visibility ; (**2**.), 
* or the accessibility of the Contents. (**3**.)

* **1\. Moderation Action affecting the availability of Content: removal of Content**

Subject to the provisions below, any Prohibited Content will be removed from the Dailymotion Service as soon as Dailymotion is effectively aware of it.

* **2. Moderation Action affecting the visibility of a Prohibited Content: application of an age restriction**

Dailymotion may decide to apply an age restriction to any Content which could offend the sensitivity of young audiences. The parental filter, activated by default on the Dailymotion website and applications, prevents Visitors from being exposed to Content put online with an age restriction. Consequently, when the parental filter is activated, the Visitor can neither access nor be exposed to such Content.

* **3. Moderation Action affecting the accessibility of a Content: application of a geo-blocking measure**

If the concerned Content violates a specific law/regulation in a given country/territory, Dailymotion can implement geo-blocking measures. These measures allow to make the Content unavailable in a specific country or territories without altering its accessibility in other countries/territories.

#### B. **APPEALING A MODERATION DECISION**

Dailymotion has established internal appeal mechanism of the decisions taken by its moderation team following the detection and/or reporting of Prohibited Contents (“**Moderation Decision(s)”**).

This internal appeal system allows:

* the author of a report to contest the Moderation Decision taken following his report;
    * the User who has put Content online that has been the subject of a Moderation Action mentioned in III A) of this policy to contest the corresponding Moderation Decision.

This internal appeal mechanism is available by contacting our Support teams (see Section II. A. C) or, in certain cases, via a URL link indicated in the e-mails sent by the moderation team to the author of the report or to the User who posted the Content online.

**APPENDIX B – Data Protection Annex**
--------------------------------------

  
**PREAMBLE**
---------------

When You make available Content on the Dailymotion Service, Your Content may include personal data of **third-parties** (e.g. images, voice recordings, names, etc.) (hereafter “**Third-Party Personal Data**”). The Processing of such Third-Party Personal Data is governed by the Applicable Data Protection Laws, as defined below.

Since You control the Content You make available on the Dailymotion Service, You alone determine the purposes and means of the Processing of Third Party Personal Data that may be included therein.

The present Appendix (“DPA”) is applicable to the Processing of Third Party Personal Data included in Your Content, per which:

* You are the Data Controller (within the meaning of the Applicable Data Protection Law) for the Processing of such Third-Party Personal Data, and
* Dailymotion is Your Data Processor.

Note that if you act on behalf of a third party Data Controller, you are a Data Processor and Dailymotion is Your Sub-Processor.

We remind you that as a Data Controller, it is Your responsibility to establish the existence of a legal basis applicable to the Processing of Third Party Personal Data incorporated in your Content, be it consent, legitimate interest, contract, or another legally recognized legal basis. **In the absence of such valid legal basis, making available on our Service any Content that incorporates Third Party Personal Data constitutes an infringement of our Prohibited Content Policy** (Appendix A).

In visiting and/or using the Dailymotion Service, You accept the DPA as binding on You, and acknowledge that it applies to the Processing of Third-Party Personal Data by Dailymotion as Your Data Processor in relation to the Content that You make available on our Service. If You do not agree with the terms of this DPA, then do not upload, post or otherwise make available Content on the Dailymotion Service.

Note that, in addition to the Processing of Third-Party Personal Data as Your Data Processor, Dailymotion processes other categories of Your personal data during Your use of our Service, and that regardless of whether You are a Viewer, Account Applicant, User or Partner. While Processing Your personal data (other than the Third-Party Personal Data described above) (i) Dailymotion is not Your Data Processor but the Data Controller, and (ii) such Processing of Your personal data is not governed by this DPA but is described in our [Privacy Policy](https://legal.dailymotion.com/en/privacy-policy/).

You and Dailymotion may be individually referred to herein as “**Party**” or collectively as the “**Parties**“.

###   
**1\. Context**

You are the Data Controller of the Third-Party Personal Data that may be incorporated into Your Content. In this capacity, You retain full control over such Third-Party Personal Data. By uploading Your Content on our Service, You (acting as Data Controller) instruct Dailymotion (acting in its capacity as Data Processor) to process the Third-Party Personal Data by hosting the Content and providing to You with content management tools.

If You act on behalf of a different Data Controller, You are a Data Processor and Dailymotion is a Sub-Processor. In such case, any references to Data Controller and Data Processor in this DPA shall be updated accordingly.

Dailymotion will cooperate with You, should You choose to notify the Supervisory Authority or an affected Data Subject of the Third-Party Personal Data Breach. Please note that the competent Supervisory Authority under this DPA is the CNIL.

Furthermore, Dailymotion undertakes to provide You with all reasonable assistance in order to help You in respecting Your obligations regarding the security of the Third-Party Personal Data. You understand and agree that the reasonable costs of our assistance, if any, will be at Your expense.

###   
**5\. Sub-Processors**

#### **5.1. General Information**

You authorize Dailymotion to use the services of any Sub-Processor listed in Section 5.2. below.

### **6\. Data Subjects Rights**

As a Data Controller, it is Your responsibility to respond to inform the Data Subjects about the details of the Processing operations and to respond to their requests relating to the exercise of their privacy rights uder the Applicable Data Protection Laws.

In this regard, Dailymotion shall:

* Communicate to You, as soon as possible, any request received frm or on behalf of Data Subjects to exercise their rights (for deletion, correction, communication, access to the Third-Party Personal Data or limitation of its Processing) except where such communication is prohibited by the competent authorities; and
* Assist You, by all appropriate and reasonable measures, in fulfilling Your obligation to comply with the requests of Data Subjects. Note that Dailymotion reserves the right to charge You for all reasonable costs and expenses related to assisting You with such requests.

Further, in this regard, You agree that:

* Dailymotion will communicate with You using the email address associated with Your Dailymotion Account and/or another email address communicated therefore to Dailymotion’s DPO;
* Dailymotion may share this email address and/or any other contact information provided within Your account (ex. the postal address) with the Data Subjects as the contact address of the Data Controller. Should You wish to designate any contact information different from what is recorded in Your Dailymotion Account, You should do so by contacting Dailymotion’s DPO;
* You shall respond to requests from Data Subjects within the timeframes set forth in the Applicable Data Protection Laws;
* You shall notify Dailymotion of Your response to each of the Data Subjects requests including, if applicable, whether You invoked an extension of the time to respond. In the absence of such notification from You within the timelines prescribed by the Applicable Data Protection Laws, You authorize Dailymotion to proceed with the removal of Your Content from the Dailymotion Service. In the event that the Data Subjects claims that Your Content contains sensitive and/or special Third-Party Personal Data (as defined under the Applicable Data Protection Laws) or that of a minor, You authorize Dailymotion to immediately disable access to Your Content pending Your response. Note that this process is separate and in addition to any other content removal process described under the Terms (ex. removal of Your Content because it violates copyright law).

You represent and warrant to Dailymotion that:

* You have obtained and will maintain for the duration of Your use of the Dailymotion Service all rights and authorizations necessary to allow us to provide You with the Processing Services including, when applicable, Data Subjects’ consent;
* All instructions You transmit to Dailymotion regarding the Processing of Third-Party Personal Data, as described under Section 3.1. are in conformity with the Applicable Data Protection Laws and, if You act in capacity of a Data Processor for another Data Controller, are compatible with any instructions You have received from such Data Controller. In particular, You warrant that You have been authorized to designate us as a Data Sub-Processor;
* the Third-Party Personal Data has been collected and is processed in compliance with the Applicable Data Protection Law;
* You have obtained the consent of the Data Subjects or have established an alternative legal basis for the collection and Processing of the said Third-Party Personal Data and You undertake to produce evidence of such consent or legal basis upon a request from Dailymotion, the Data Subjects and/or competent authorities.

To that end, You undertake to defend and indemnify Dailymotion against any and all claims, fees, fines, or other expenses incurred in relation to the availability on our Service of Your Content integrating Third-Party Personal Data.

### **8\. Requests**

#### 8.1 Audit Requests

To the extent the Processing is subject to the EU Data Protection Law, as a Data Controller, You have a right to audit the Processing activities undertaken by Dailymotion as Your Data Processor within the limitations set forth in this Section.

If You reasonably believe that Dailymotion does not respect one of its specific obligations as Your Data Processor, You may request an audit by submitting a description of this specific suspected failure and an audit request to Dailymotion, using the contact details listed in Section 10 of this DPA. As part of the audit, Dailymotion undertakes to provide You with the information in its possession and strictly necessary to demonstrate the respect of Dailymotion’s obligations as Your Data Processor under this DPA, subject to the respect of Third-Parties’ rights and the security requirements of Dailymotion’s IT systems.

For sake of clarity, You shall not be entitled to receive any information outside of this limited scope of the requested audit. You may request such audit not more often than once per thirty-six (36) months’ period and under the condition that You inform Dailymotion at the latest sixty (60) working days before its planned starting date. Such audit must be performed by an external, qualified and independent third-party auditor at Your expense at Dailymotion’s headquarters and during normal business hours and must be limited to two business days (unless the circumstances do not reasonably allow it to be completed within such time). The auditor must be subject to strict contractual obligations of confidentiality, and the results of such audit must also be treated as confidential information and must be shared with Dailymotion. Dailymotion may object in writing to an auditor appointed by You if the auditor is, in Dailymotion’s reasonable opinion, not sufficiently qualified or independent, a competitor of Dailymotion, or otherwise manifestly unsuitable. Any such objection by Dailymotion will require You to appoint another auditor.

If the audit reveals a non-respect of Dailymotion’s obligations, Dailymotion will take reasonable measures to remedy it or cease the Processing of Your Content. If You are not satisfied with the result of such audit, You may exercise Your right to stop or suspend the use of the Dailymotion Service.

Furthermore, You agree that if during the twenty-four (24) months preceding Your audit request, the matter of Your request has already been subject to another audit initiated by Dailymotion or by a third-party, the sharing of such audit’s results with You will satisfy Dailymotion’s audit obligation under the present Section.

#### 8.2 Public Authorities Requests

In its role as a Data Processor, Dailymotion shall maintain appropriate measures to protect Third Party Personal Data in accordance with the requirements of applicable data protection Laws and regulations, including by implementing appropriate technical and organizational safeguards to protect Third Party Personal Data against any interference that goes beyond what is necessary in a democratic society to safeguard national security, defense and public security.

If Dailymotion receives a legally binding request to provide Third Party Personal Data to a Public Authority, Dailymotion shall, unless otherwise legally prohibited, promptly notify You and provide You with a summary of the nature of the request. Dailymotion may challenge the request if, after careful assessment, it concludes that there are reasonable grounds to consider that the request is unlawful, and may pursue possibilities of appeal and/or seek interim measures with a view to suspending the effects of the request until the competent judicial authority had decided on its merits. It shall not disclose the Third Party Personal Data requested until required to do so under the applicable procedural rules. Dailymotion agrees it will provide the minimum amount of information permissible when responding to a request for disclosure, based on a reasonable interpretation of the request. For the avoidance of doubt, this DPA shall not require Dailymotion to pursue action or inaction that could result in civil or criminal penalty for Dailymotion such as contempt of court.

###   
**9\. Transfers of **Third-Party Personal Data****

To the extent our provision of the Processing Services to You results in the transfer of the Third Party Personal Data incorporated in Your Content from the European Economic Area, United Kingdom or Switzerland to a Third Country, the 2021 SCC, as complemented below, shall be applicable to such transfer.

It is agreed by the Parties that the 2021 SCC are complemented as follows:

* The data exporter: You
    
    * Data exporter identity: as indicated within Your Dailymotion Account
    
    * Data exporter role: Controller or Processor (if acting on behalf of a third party Controller)
* The data importer:
    
    * The Dailymotion entity You contract with, namely:
        
        * If You are established in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom or Switzerland:  Dailymotion SA, 140 boulevard Malesherbes, 75017 Paris, France, contact details: [dpo@dailymotion.com](mailto:dpo@dailymotion.com), or
        
        * if You are established in any other territory:  Dailymotion Inc., 57 E 11th St, Floor 5, New York NY 10003, USA, contact details: [legal@dailymotion.com](mailto:legal@dailymotion.com);
    
    * For the purpose of the UK GDPR, the local representative of Dailymotion is : The DPO Centre Ltd, 50 Liverpool street, London, EC2M 7PY, UK, +44 (0) 203 797 6340, [advice@dpocentre.com](mailto:advice@dpocentre.com).
    
    * Data importer role: Processor or Sub-Processor if data exporter is a Processor.

For transfers from the EEA:

* Module Two applies where You (data exporter) are a Controller and Dailymotion (data importer) is a Processor,
    
    * Module Three applies where You (data exporter) are a Processor of a third-party Data Controller and Dailymotion (data importer) is a Processor;
    
    * in Clause 7, the optional docking clause does not apply;
* in Clause 9(a) of Module Three, option 2 applies, and the time period for prior notice of Sub-processor changes is 14 days;
* in Clause 11(a), the optional language does not apply;
* in Clause 17, Option 1 applies with the governing law being that of France;
* in Clause 18(b), disputes will be resolved before the courts in Paris, France;
* Annex I of the 2021 SCCs and parties activities are completed with the information in Section 3 of the DPA;
* Annex II of the 2021 SCCs is completed with the information in Section 4 of the DPA; and
* Annex III of the 2021 SCCs is completed with the information in Section 5.2 of the DPA.  
    
* For transfers from **Switzerland**: where a transfer to a Third Country is made from Switzerland, the 2021 SCCs incorporated into this DPA, as modified in Section 9, apply to the transfer except that:
* in Clause 13, the competent Supervisory Authority is the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner if the transfer is governed by the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection; and
* references to “Member State” in the 2021 SCCs refer to Switzerland, and data subjects located in Switzerland may exercise and enforce their rights under the 2021 SCCs in Switzerland; and
* references to the “General Data Protection Regulation”, “Regulation 2016/679” and “GDPR” in the 2021 SCCs refer to the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (as amended or replaced).

* For transfers from the UK: where a transfer to a Third Country is made from the UK, the UK Addendum is incorporated into this DPA and applies to the transfer as follows: the UK Addendum is completed with the information in Sections 3, 4 and 5.2 of this DPA; and both “Importer” and “Exporter” are selected in Table 4.

The acceptance of  the Terms constitutes mutual acceptance and  signature of the 2021 SCC, incorporated in the present DPA,  and their annexes.

In the event that Dailymotion either directly or indirectly transfers Third-Party Personal Data to a Third Country through a third-party Sub-Processor (instead of Processing such Third-Party Personal Data itself), Dailymotion will ensure that such transfer is done only in the presence of legally adequate safeguards such as, 2021 SCC integrated within contract as with such Sub-Processors and/or by obtaining a commitment from such Sub-Processors to enter into 2021 SCC with their own Sub-Processors (if any).  

As of the last update of the Terms, Dailymotion has conducted an assessment of the applicable laws and regulations or practices of the Third Countries of destination where the Processing of Third Party Personal Data may occur. It has been established that the Third Party Personal Data that is transferred to these Third Countries is stored in our own proprietary datacenters and for a limited duration in time (all new videos are duplicated on the servers of these datacenters but then only copies of the videos that got popular in the territories closer to the datacenter are kept for a longer time on these servers in Third Countries). Also, Dailymotion is designed as a video-sharing platform, meaning that the videos which may contain Third Party Personal Data are public by default, and therefore accessible to anyone.

Also, Dailymotion has no reason to believe that the laws and practices in any Third Country of destination applicable to the Processing of Third Party Personal Data, including any requirements to disclose Third Party Personal Data or measures authorizing access by a Public Authority (e.g. a government agency, or law enforcement authority, including judicial authorities), prevent Dailymotion from fulfilling its obligations under this DPA.
