You retain ownership in your User Comments and all Intellectual Rights contained therein, provided such User Comments do not contain Feedback, as defined below, or our Intellectual Property. We may from time to time publicly share or redistribute User Comments on our Website, or through other Community channels, press releases, or promotional and marketing materials. You hereby grant us an unrestricted, irrevocable, perpetual, royalty-free, non-exclusive, fully transferable and sub-licensable worldwide right and license to use your User Comments in connection with the promotion of the Game.

We appreciate any feedback, suggestions, improvements, constructive criticism, or ideas you may have in connection with the Game or Website (**“Feedback”**).

_User Generated Content_

We appreciate that our End Users may be inspired to create and share your fan art, fan fiction, video montages, Let’s Play videos, and other creative content with our Community (herein **“User Generated Content”**). We also appreciate that End Users may wish to stream and record their gameplay and share it with the Community or through social media video streaming services such as YouTube.com, Twitch.tv or TikTok.com—for the purpose of these Terms, we also consider your streams and videos containing Game content “User Generated Content”. You affirm that you have the necessary rights to post the User Generated Content which you post to and/or in relation to the Game. You also affirm that such content, or its potential use by us in accordance with these Terms, does not violate these Terms, applicable law, or the intellectual property or proprietary rights of others, including rights of publicity and rights of privacy. We only ask that, as a courtesy, you send us a note or @ us when sharing your User Generated Content so that we have a chance to support and promote you as you show your support for the Game.

However, User Generated Content shared with the Community must comply with these Terms, including our Community guidelines, as well as the Agreement. You agree that neither the Company, nor any Platform on which you access and/or use the Game or post User Generated Content on, is liable for User Generated Content that is provided/posted by you or others. We have no duty to pre-screen User Generated Content, but may have the right to refuse to post, edit, or deliver submitted User Generated Content. We reserve the right to remove User Generated Content or seek to have it removed for any reason, but are not responsible for any failure or delay in removing such material. We also reserve the right to block any End User’s access to any content, website or webpage that we provide at our sole discretion. Failure to comply with any of the terms contained herein may result in our utilizing any legal remedies that may be available to us, including issuing takedown notices to the appropriate service providers due to the breach of the licenses and rights granted to you herein.

We want you to create and express yourself freely, and you retain all rights in and to your User Generated Content. That being said, by sharing your User Generated Content with the Community, you grant us an unrestricted, irrevocable, perpetual, royalty-free, non-exclusive, fully transferable and sub-licensable worldwide right and license to use your User Generated Content, including, but not limited to, the rights to reproduce, distribute, adapt, modify, create derivative works from, perform, display, publish, broadcast, transmit, or otherwise communicate to the public in all media now known or hereafter devised, for any purpose, without any further notice or compensation to you. You hereby waive and relinquish any claim based upon “moral rights” (as that term is commonly understood) or any rights of attribution or integrity in connection with content submitted to us hereunder. This license grant, and the above waiver of any applicable moral rights, survives any termination of this license.

_Infringing Content_

To the extent possible under International Law, we are not liable for any copyright infringement arising from any User Generated Content shared with the Community. However, under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, we are able to provide the lawful owners of copyrighted works recourse in the event that their copyrights are infringed, provided our ability to do so is not superseded by the interests of any social media platform used to share copyrighted works (in such event, you should look for the take down procedure supplied by the social media platform). If you believe that your copyrights are being violated by User Generated Content, User Comments, or other materials located in the Game or on our Website or other Community channels under our direct control, please contact us so that we may investigate your claims, and, if appropriate, modify or remove the infringing material. We require the following information before we are able to investigate your claim:

The above information should be provided to our registered DMCA agent for notice of claims of copyright or other intellectual property infringement, who can be reached at: dschnider@nolanheimann.com

If you believe your content has been taken down pursuant to the above procedures in error, we require the following information sent to our agent referenced above before we can investigate your claim or re-post your content:

* Your name, address, telephone number, and email address;
* Identification of the material and its location before it was removed;
* A statement under penalty of perjury that the material was removed by mistake or misidentification;

Please note that pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), any misrepresentation of material fact in a written notification automatically subjects the complaining party to liability for any damages, costs and attorney’s fees incurred by us in connection with the written notification and allegation of copyright infringement.

You further agree that you will not link to any such third-party network, torrent, FTP, file-sharing service, intranet, or “cloud” that is not legally owned by us or our distributors, as applicable.

_Virtual Currency and Virtual Items_

Generally. The Game is a free-to-play game, however we provide End Users a license to use Virtual Currency to the extent that the Game permits End Users to purchase such Virtual Currency in connection with the Game, and a license to a variety of virtual, in-game or in-app items, as may be applicable (**“Virtual Items”**). For purposes of this Agreement, **“Virtual Currency”** shall be defined as simulated currency of no actual value outside of the Game in the form of “Palia Coins”, gained by End Users through purchase to obtain certain Virtual Items available as part of the Game. For the avoidance of any doubt, Virtual Currency and Virtual Items only permit you certain limited rights or licenses, as set forth herein.

To the extent that you remain in compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and reside in an area where Virtual Currency or Virtual Items are made available, we grant you the nonexclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, limited right and license to use Virtual Currency and Virtual Items obtained through purchase strictly for non-commercial use and solely within the Game. You shall not acquire any title or ownership in or to Virtual Currency or Virtual Items. You acknowledge that in purchasing any such Virtual Currency or Virtual Items, additional costs may be added by Company or our payment processing provider to cover any and all applicable taxes or service fees that may be due to complete your purchase.

As permitted by law, we retain the right to modify or otherwise affect the perceived value of any Virtual Currency or Virtual Items at any time and may also modify such values, at our sole and exclusive discretion. You acknowledge that the license granted to you with respect to Virtual Currency and Virtual Items related to the Game will terminate in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, or at any time that we elect to stop permitting access to such Virtual Currency, Virtual Items, the Game, or this Agreement is otherwise terminated.

We retain the right to set limits on the amount of Virtual Currency that can be spent in any given time-period as well as limits as to the total amount of Virtual Currency that may be credited to or obtained by any given End User.

In-Game Use. For clarity, Virtual Currency and Virtual Items may only be used within the Game, and we retain the right to limit your use of the Virtual Currency or Virtual Items at all times.

Your Account will reflect any unused and available Virtual Currency applicable to that Platform. You must have sufficient available Virtual Currency in your Account in order to complete a virtual transaction. The amount of Virtual Currency in your Account may be reduced at any time without notice to you in the event of certain occurrences, including events related to gameplay (e.g., elimination of character or simulated goods). All Virtual Currency and Virtual Items are unconditionally forfeited if your Account is terminated or suspended for any reason, at our sole discretion, or if our Company discontinues any Virtual Currency or Virtual Item program.

We disclaim any and all liability or responsibility for hacking, misuse or unauthorized use, or loss of your Virtual Currency or Virtual Items. You remain responsible to notify us immediately if you discover any unauthorized use of your Virtual Currency. Any such reporting or requests for support should be made with Player Support. We do not have any obligation to, and will not, reimburse you for any Virtual Currency or Virtual Items lost due to your violation of these Terms.

Virtual Currency is non-redeemable and non-transferable. Virtual Currency and Virtual Items may not be transferred or resold for commercial gain in any manner, including, without limitation, by means of any direct sale or auction service. You acknowledge and agree that you may not convert, sell, lease, license, rent or otherwise commercialize the Virtual Currency or Virtual Items under any circumstance. Virtual Currency is only redeemable for Virtual Items and is not redeemable for any sum of money or monetary value or other goods from us or any other person or entity at any time. Virtual Currency and Virtual Items have no cash value, and neither Company nor any other person or entity has any obligation to exchange your Virtual Currency or Virtual Items for anything of tangible value, including, but not limited to, real currency.

Without limiting any of the foregoing, to the fullest extent permitted by law, we retain the right to modify, suspend, eliminate or otherwise alter Virtual Currency or Virtual Items in our sole and exclusive discretion without any liability to you or any third party. Any unauthorized use of Virtual Currency or Virtual Items by you, including but not limited to, the unauthorized transferring, sale or exchange of Virtual Currency or Virtual Items, is strictly forbidden. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to terminate, suspend, or modify your Account, your access to Virtual Currency and Virtual Items, and/or to terminate your right and license to continue using the Game should you participate in any such unauthorized actions.

Purchases of Virtual Items through the use of Virtual Currency are final and non-refundable, non-transferable, and non-exchangeable. Purchases of Virtual Currency itself are also non-transferable and non-exchangeable, however they may be refunded within fourteen (14) days of purchase as long as no portion of the purchased Virtual Currency has been used, except as otherwise required under applicable law. You acknowledge that the Company retains the right to suspend or completely eliminate the right to refunds if End Users abuse this policy (e.g., repeated refunds for the same product). Refunds for real currency will only be issued to the same form of payment used to purchase the Virtual Currency. Please ensure that the same form of payment can be used to receive refunds.

Company takes chargebacks very seriously and works hard to prevent them from occurring. If you find you need to issue a dispute for a credit card transaction, please reach out to Player Support first so we can work towards finding a resolution. End Users acknowledge that once a chargeback occurs, Company will first suspend the End User Account associated with the chargeback request. The affected End User may only regain access to their Account by contacting Player Support and repaying the amount due. To maintain the security of End User Accounts, we may treat fraud alerts and requests for information (e.g., cardholder or card issuing bank querying the authenticity of the transaction) in the same way as chargebacks. If multiple chargebacks occur and are attributable to the same End User Account, Company reserves the right to permanently ban that Account.

Company reserves the right to modify this policy at any time without prior notice, but will endeavor to make reasonable efforts to be as transparent as possible with our End Users. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact Player Support.
