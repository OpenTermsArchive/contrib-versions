### 3\. NING Product Plans And Payment

**NING Product Plans**

As a Network Creator, you must purchase a NING Product Plan for your Network. The categories and prices of the currently applicable NING Product Plans are described [here](https://www.ning.com/pricing/), which we refer to as “NING 3.0 Networks”, and are subject to change from time to time. If you created Your Network prior to March 11, 2013, which we refer to as “NING 2.0 Networks”, the categories and prices of NING Product Plans are described [here](https://www.ning.com/pricing/) and are subject to change from time to time. In addition to the aforementioned NING Product Plans, there is a stand-alone “LightNING” product subject to the rules of use specified [here](https://www.ning.com/lightning-terms-of-use/). LightNING Product Plans are available through this [link](https://light.ning.com/?utm_source=test) and may occasionally change. For Network Creators interested in monetizing their Networks, an E-commerce service is offered as an optional feature activated on NING Networks. The E-commerce terms of use are available [here](https://www.ning.com/e-commerce-service-terms-of-use/). NING may offer promotional campaigns and plans placing detailed information about such campaigns and plans [here](https://www.ning.com/promo-terms/). NING may choose to temporarily change the fees for promotional or new services, and such changes are immediately effective when NING posts the temporary promotional event or new service on the NING Platform. At the end of your promotional period, your fees will automatically revert to the then-current fees for the applicable NING Product Plan. Any changes to fees for the NING Product Plans that are not temporary or promotional will be effective thirty (30) days after we provide you with notice by posting such changes on the NING Platform. The changes shall only apply prospectively to the items you’ve purchased. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in U.S. Dollars.

**Payment/Ongoing Plans/Cancellation**

You are responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with the NING Product Plans in a timely manner with a valid payment method. You authorize NING or its third party payment providers to charge your credit card, charge card, debit card, PayPal, or financial institution account (herein “**Payment Method**“) for all charges to your accounts with NING. Your Payment Method will be charged the current fee for the NING Product Plans you choose promptly following the end of your free trial period. To view and manage information relating to your NING Product Plans, including billing and invoice history, please sign in to your NING.com account.

**You agree that your NING Product Plans will continue in effect unless and until you cancel it or NING terminates it. Unless so cancelled or terminated, NING will automatically charge the applicable fee (and any taxes, if applicable) to your Payment Method at the beginning of each recurring billing period.**For example, if you choose a NING Product Plan with a monthly billing plan, you will be billed each successive month on or about the same date of the month that you initially clicked the purchase button (or otherwise elected to make a purchase). Additionally, we may offer a pre-pay payment option (such as annual billing) for payment of NING Product Plans (“Pre-Payment Plan”). If you opt for a Pre-Payment Plan, your Payment Method will be charged the then-current fee for that NING Product Plan at the commencement of the initial period and each renewal period. **You may cancel your NING Product Plans by following the instructions** [**here**](https://www.ning.com/help/?p=5690)**.**

You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to NING may be shared by NING with companies who work on NING’s behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purpose of checking credit, effecting payment to NING and servicing your account. The terms of your payment will be based on your chosen Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution providing such Payment Method. You agree to pay NING all charges incurred under your account for any NING Product Plans in which you or anyone else who uses your account enroll in accordance with this Agreement.**If your Payment Method fails or your account is otherwise past due, (a) you agree to pay all amounts due on your account upon demand, (b) NING may collect fees owed using other collection mechanisms (this includes charging other payment methods on file with us) and (c) NING reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your NING Product Plans or your account with NING. Please note that this means that if your account is past due, or if you have otherwise terminated or suspended your NING Product Plan, access to your Network may be disabled and all items in Your Network, including its Content and Network Data, may be permanently deleted from the NING Platform.**

NING Product Plans are subject to the billing and refund policy set forth [here](https://www.ning.com/billingpolicy/). Except as may be set forth in such billing and refund policy or Section 30 (Term and Termination), any fees charged to your account are non-refundable. You agree to submit any disputes regarding any charge to your account in writing to NING within thirty (30) days of such charge, otherwise such dispute will be waived and such charge will be final and not subject to challenge. Refunds (if any) made pursuant to such dispute, are at the discretion of NING.

This license will terminate at the time you remove Your Content from the NING Platform. Without limiting the foregoing, you agree that Content you remove may persist for a reasonable amount of time in back-up copies (but these copies will not be available to others).

For NING 3.0 Networks, NING may introduce the option to participate in a marketplace-type program designed to entice Network Creators to benefit from each other in terms of Content and Members across the NING Platform. The intent of such program would be to provide participating Networks with several benefits, including: (i) reaching a broader audience with compelling Content from Your Network (for example, Network Creators of NING 3.0 Networks could be given the option to feature Content that originated from other participating NING 3.0 Networks and/or compelling Content from participating NING 3.0 Networks could be redistributed by on its owned & operated web properties (in each case, with attribution and links back to the originating Network) and (ii) new ways to attract Members that may be relevant to Your community and objectives (for example, a transparent and automated way for any Member of a participating NING 3.0 Network to discover other relevant NING Networks that are participating in such program and/or participating NING 3.0 Networks may also be given periodic lists of suggested Members from other participating NING 3.0 Network to invite to Your Network.

To deliver such an automated marketplace-type program, NING 3.0 Networks that choose to participate in such program grant to NING a right to (i) provide, promote and improve the NING Platform, including through sending invitations and other similar bulletins to Members of Your Network and (ii) make Content submitted to the NING Platform available for syndication, broadcast or other distribution elsewhere on the NING Platform owned and operated websites. The rights in this paragraph would only apply if a Network Creator elects to grant such rights to NING as part of NING 3.0 Network subscription purchase flow or other similar mechanism offered to Network Creators by NING.

You hereby agree that if Your Content is removed from any Network due to a violation of these Terms of Service, including in response to any valid DMCA (as defined below) take down notice or because such Content contains illegal images, NING shall have the right to use and reproduce Your Content in any manner without restriction, including in response to any subpoena or other judicial or administrative order, to assist government enforcement agencies or otherwise required by law and to protect the rights, property or safety of NING, any User or individual, or the general public.

You are solely responsible for Your Content and Network Data. You are responsible for making sure that you have all rights in Your Content and Network Data, including the rights necessary for you to grant the foregoing licenses to Your Content and Network Data. You understand that whether or not Your Content is published or marked private by you, NING does not guarantee any confidentiality or privacy with respect to any of Your Content or Network Data.

Additionally, you understand and agree that Your Content and Network Data that is displayed on the NING Platform may continue to appear on the NING Platform, even after you have terminated your account, as portions of Your Content may have been incorporated into Member profiles, RSS feeds or other features.

In addition to the rights, licenses and privileges referred to above, you agree that NING may use and refer to your Network (including screen shots), trademarks, service marks, trade names, image, character, logos, domain names and other distinctive brand features or identification in marketing materials, press releases, financial reports, presentations, website materials, customer lists and other media now known or hereafter discovered in connection with the marketing, advertising and promotion of the NING Platform, and any products, goods, features, capabilities and/or services associated with the NING Platform.

As a Network Creator or Member you acknowledge that NING and its designees reserve the right, but shall have no obligation, to pre-screen, filter, remove, refuse to accept, post, display, or transmit any Content through or on any Network or the NING Platform in whole or in part at any time for any reason or no reason with or without notice and with no liability of any kind.

If a Network or Member account is removed from the NING Platform, the Content associated with that Network may also be deleted at the discretion of the Network Creator or NING. We encourage you to be sure you are comfortable with this possibility before contributing Your Content to a Network. You should be aware that NING is not required and may not keep back-up copies of Content on the NING Platform once the Network or Content is deleted. Additionally, NING makes no guarantee, either during or after the term of this Agreement, that Your Content will be safely stored on the NING Platform and you should independently back-up and archive Your Content.
