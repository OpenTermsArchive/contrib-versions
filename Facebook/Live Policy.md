2\. General policies for Facebook Live

**Prohibited business practices**

Facebook Live must not be used to mislead users to think that specific footage is occurring in real time when it is not.

Example:

*   Misrepresenting footage of an event that occurred a year ago as currently happening

**Inaccurate location**

Facebook Live must not be used to mislead users to think that specific footage is happening in a particular locale when it is not.

Example:

*   Misrepresenting footage from a different country as footage from the United States

**Pre-recorded content**

All pre-recorded content contained in a broadcast streamed to Facebook Live must be clearly marked as pre-recorded. For broadcasts that contain a mixture of live footage and pre-recorded footage, only the pre-recorded footage must be marked as pre-recorded.

Example:

*   Adding a graphic to mark specific footage as pre-recorded

*   Including a disclaimer in the video description or title that specific content is pre-recorded

**Looping or static content**

Facebook Live should not be used to broadcast looping videos, static images or poll-only videos.

Example:

*   Streaming a 20-minute clip that is continuously looped

*   A broadcast that is limited to a photo and has no other auditory or visual elements

*   A broadcast that only contains a poll
