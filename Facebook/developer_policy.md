Facebook Platform Policy
========================

1\. Build a quality product
---------------------------

1.  Develop your app with your personal account. Do not create a fake account to manage your app. If applicable, ensure that your Business Manager account is up to date and accurate.
    
2.  Build an app that is stable and easily navigable. Be sure your app insights reflect a positive experience.

3.  Ensure that your app’s content (including ads and user-generated content) meets our [Community Standards](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards).
    
4.  Follow our [Advertising Policies](https://www.facebook.com/ad_guidelines.php) for your app name, icons, and description.
    
5.  Keep your app or bot’s description and categorization up-to-date. [![](https://scontent-lhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2178-6/851547_537948159656190_540847388_n.png?_nc_ohc=iEyND8Fmg-0AX90_D1C&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-1.xx&oh=f998733195b2c154f2803beba66c3a26&oe=5F2AAECA)](#)
    
6.  Don’t include promotional content in your app’s icon (ex: don’t overlay your icon image with “new”, “sale”, “update” or any type of notification jewel)
    
7.  Don’t confuse, deceive, defraud, mislead, spam or surprise anyone. [![](https://scontent-lhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2178-6/851547_537948159656190_540847388_n.png?_nc_ohc=iEyND8Fmg-0AX90_D1C&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-1.xx&oh=f998733195b2c154f2803beba66c3a26&oe=5F2AAECA)](#)
    
8.  Keep your app’s negative feedback below our thresholds. [![](https://scontent-lhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2178-6/851547_537948159656190_540847388_n.png?_nc_ohc=iEyND8Fmg-0AX90_D1C&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-1.xx&oh=f998733195b2c154f2803beba66c3a26&oe=5F2AAECA)](#)
    
9.  Follow any instructions we include in our [technical documentation](/docs/).
    
10.  Apps with minimal utility that provide predictions, assessments, or similar outputs to the user, may not be allowed on Platform. For example, apps that provide (or claim to provide) users with assessments of personality, personal attributes, character traits, behavioral tendencies, or whose core functionality otherwise involves making predictions about who the user is, may not be allowed.
    

2\. Give people control
-----------------------

1.  Obtain consent from people before publishing content on their behalf. [![](https://scontent-lhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2178-6/851547_537948159656190_540847388_n.png?_nc_ohc=iEyND8Fmg-0AX90_D1C&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-1.xx&oh=f998733195b2c154f2803beba66c3a26&oe=5F2AAECA)](#)
    
2.  Use publishing permissions to help people share on Facebook, not to send people messages from your app. [![](https://scontent-lhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2178-6/851547_537948159656190_540847388_n.png?_nc_ohc=iEyND8Fmg-0AX90_D1C&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-1.xx&oh=f998733195b2c154f2803beba66c3a26&oe=5F2AAECA)](#)
    
3.  Don’t prefill any content in captions, comments, messages or the user message parameter of posts unless (a) it is a single hashtag in a post shared through our Share Dialog (but not via our APIs), (b) it was created by the person using your app, or (c) it was created by a business whose employees use your app to administer the business’s presence on Facebook. [![](https://scontent-lhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2178-6/851547_537948159656190_540847388_n.png?_nc_ohc=iEyND8Fmg-0AX90_D1C&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-1.xx&oh=f998733195b2c154f2803beba66c3a26&oe=5F2AAECA)](/docs/apps/review/prefill)
    
4.  Privacy Policy
    
    a. Provide a publicly available and easily accessible privacy policy that explains what data you are collecting and how you will use that data.
    
    b. Your privacy policy must not modify, supersede, or be inconsistent with Facebook policies. For example, user data obtained from us cannot be transferred to a data broker or sold, even if you disclose this in your privacy policy.
    
    c. Include your privacy policy URL in the App Dashboard. [![](https://scontent-lhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2178-6/851547_537948159656190_540847388_n.png?_nc_ohc=iEyND8Fmg-0AX90_D1C&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-1.xx&oh=f998733195b2c154f2803beba66c3a26&oe=5F2AAECA)](#)

    e. Comply with your privacy policy.
    
5.  You may use [Account Information](https://developers.facebook.com/policy/#definitions) in accordance with your privacy policy and other Facebook policies. All other data may not be transferred outside your app, except to your service provider (per, Section 3.7) who needs that information to provide services to your app. With the exception of Account Information, you may only maintain user data obtained from us for as long as necessary for your business purpose.
    
6.  Delete all of a person’s data you have received from us (including friend data) if that person asks you to, unless you are required to keep it by law, regulation, or separate agreement with us. You may keep aggregated data only if no information identifying a specific person could be inferred or created from it.
    
7.  Obtain consent from people before using their data in any ad.
    
8.  Obtain adequate consent from people before using any Facebook technology that allows us to collect and process data about them, including for example, our SDKs and browser pixels. When you use such technology, provide an appropriate disclosure:
    
    a. That third parties, including Facebook, may use cookies, web beacons, and other storage technologies to collect or receive information from your websites, apps and elsewhere on the internet and use that information to provide measurement services, target ads and as described in our [Data Policy](https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/); and
    
    b. How users can opt-out of the collection and use of information for ad targeting and where a user can access a mechanism for exercising such choice. [![](https://scontent-lhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2178-6/851547_537948159656190_540847388_n.png?_nc_ohc=iEyND8Fmg-0AX90_D1C&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-1.xx&oh=f998733195b2c154f2803beba66c3a26&oe=5F2AAECA)](#)
    
9.  In jurisdictions that require informed consent for the storing and accessing of cookies or other information on an end user’s device (such as the European Union), ensure, in a verifiable manner, that an end user provides the necessary consent before you use Facebook technologies that enable us to store and access cookies or other information on the end user’s device. For suggestions on implementing consent mechanisms, visit [Facebook’s Cookie Consent Guide for Sites and Apps](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/privacy).
    
10.  Obtain consent from people before you give us information that you independently collected from them.
    
11.  Provide meaningful customer support for your app, and make it easy for people to contact you.
    
12.  If people come to your app from the Facebook app on iOS, give them an option to go back to the Facebook app by using the Back to Facebook banner provided in our SDK.
    
13.  If people come to your app from the Facebook app on Android, don’t prevent them from going back to Facebook when they press the system back button.
    

3\. Protect data
----------------

1.  Protect the information you receive from us against unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, don't use data obtained from us to provide tools that are used for surveillance.
    
2.  Only show data obtained from a user access token on the devices associated with that token.
    
3.  Only use friend data (including friends list) in the person’s experience in your app.
    
4.  If you cache data you receive from us, use it to improve your app’s user experience and keep it up to date. [![](https://scontent-lhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2178-6/851547_537948159656190_540847388_n.png?_nc_ohc=iEyND8Fmg-0AX90_D1C&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-1.xx&oh=f998733195b2c154f2803beba66c3a26&oe=5F2AAECA)](#)
    
5.  Don’t proxy, request or collect Facebook usernames or passwords.
    
6.  Keep private your secret key and access tokens. You can share them with an agent acting to operate your app if they sign a confidentiality agreement.
    
7.  Don't use a service provider in connection with your use of Platform unless you make them sign a contract to: (a) protect any user data you obtained from us (that is at least as protective as our terms and policies), (b) limit their use of that user data solely to using it on your behalf to provide services to your app (and not for their own purposes or any other purposes), and (c) keep it secure and confidential. You must ensure they comply with our terms and policies (and are responsible for their non-compliance).
    
8.  Keep Facebook user IDs within your control. You can only share them with service providers who help you build or run your app. Ensure that they keep the user IDs secure and confidential and comply with our policies (ex: see, 3.7). If you need an anonymous unique identifier to share with service providers, use our [mechanism](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v2.2/user).
    
9.  Don't sell, license, or purchase any data obtained from us or our services.
    
10.  Don't directly or indirectly transfer any data that you receive from us (including anonymous, aggregate, or derived data) to any ad network, data broker or other advertising or monetization-related service. By “indirectly” we mean you aren’t allowed to, for example, transfer data to a third party who then transfers the data to an ad network.
    
11.  Don't put Facebook data in a search engine or directory, or include web search functionality on Facebook.
    
12.  If you are acquired by or merge with a third party, you can continue to use our data only within your app.
    
13.  If you stop using Platform, promptly delete all user data you have received from us (absent explicit consent from people). You can keep [Account Information](https://developers.facebook.com/policy/#definitions) if you have presented your privacy policy within your app.
    
14.  If you use friend data from Facebook to establish social connections in your app, only do so if each person in that connection has granted you access to that information.
    
15.  Don't use data obtained from Facebook to make decisions about eligibility, including whether to approve or reject an application or how much interest to charge on a loan.
    
16.  If you implement or have previously implemented (on your own behalf or on behalf of a third party) any Facebook Tools / Facebook Business Tools (as defined in our standard terms for such Facebook Tools /Facebook Business Tools (“Facebook Business Tools Terms”), currently available at: [https://www.facebook.com/customaudiences/app/tos](https://www.facebook.com/customaudiences/app/tos), or any successor terms we may make available, including at: [https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/businesstools](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/businesstools), you acknowledge that the Facebook Business Tools Terms apply in connection with your usage of Platform, including for optimization of Platform and/or the related Facebook Company Product.
