Meta Platform Terms
===================

1\. Introduction
----------------

*   
    a. The Meta for Developers Platform (“Platform”) is the set of APIs, SDKs, tools, plugins, code, technology, content, and services that enables others, including app developers and website operators, to develop functionality, retrieve data from Meta and any other [Meta Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139?ref=tos), or provide data to us.
    
*   
    b. To use Platform (including to Process any Platform Data), you agree to these Platform Terms (“Terms”), as well as all other applicable terms and policies. This may include the [Meta Terms of Service](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms), the [Instagram Terms of Use](https://help.instagram.com/581066165581870), the [Meta Commercial Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/commercial_terms), the [Business Tools Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/businesstools/), and any [Meta Product](https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139?ref=tos) terms that are applicable.
    
*   
    c. You must also comply with the applicable requirements in our [Developer Policies](https://developers.facebook.com/devpolicy/) and those made available on our [Developer Site](https://developers.facebook.com/), including in our [Documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/) (collectively, the “Developer Docs”) and all applicable laws and regulations, including with respect to your collection, use, or other processing of Platform Data.
    
*   
    d. These Terms will start when you accept them or otherwise start accessing or using Platform, whichever date is earlier. If you are accepting these Terms or accessing or using Platform on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind such entity to these Terms and you agree on behalf of such entity to be bound by these Terms (and for clarity, all other references to “you” in these Terms refer to such entity).
    
*   
    e. If you fail to comply with these Terms or any other applicable terms or policies, we may suspend or terminate your App or account, as described below.
    
*   
    f. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein (including in Section 12 (“Glossary”) have the meaning given in our other terms and policies, including our [Terms of Service](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms) and our [Meta Commercial Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/commercial_terms). The term “including” means “including without limitation.”

        *   
            2\. If you use the Meta Business Tools to send us Business Tool Data, our use of that data is governed by the Business Tools Terms rather than the foregoing license for Your Content.
            
        *   
            3\. If you owned Your Content before providing it to us, you will continue owning it after providing it to us, subject to any rights granted in these Terms or any other applicable terms or policies and any access you provide to others by sharing it via Platform.

        *   
            3\. Nothing in these Terms will be interpreted as a representation or agreement that we will not develop or have not developed apps, products, features, or services that are similar to your App or compete with your App.
            
        
    *
