Facebook Platform Terms
=======================

1\. Introduction
----------------

*     
    a. Our Platform is the set of APIs, SDKs, tools, plugins, code, technology, content, and services that enables others, including app developers and website operators, to develop functionality, retrieve data from Facebook and any other [Facebook Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139?ref=tos), or provide data to us.
    
*     
    b. To use Platform (including to Process any Platform Data), you agree to these Platform Terms (“Terms”), as well as all other applicable terms and policies. This may include the [Facebook Terms of Service](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms), the [Instagram Terms of Use](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F581066165581870), the [Facebook Commercial Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/commercial_terms), the [Business Tools Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/businesstools/update), and any [Facebook Product](https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139?ref=tos) terms that are applicable.
    
*     
    c. You must also comply with the applicable requirements in our [Developer Policies](https://developers.facebook.com/devpolicy/) and those made available on our [Developer Site](https://developers.facebook.com/), including in our [Documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/) collectively, the “Developer Docs”)
    
*     
    d. These Terms will start on the earlier of the date you accept them or otherwise start accessing or using Platform, and will continue until you stop accessing and using Platform, unless ended earlier as described below. If you are accepting these Terms or accessing or using Platform on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind such entity to these Terms and you agree on behalf of such entity to be bound by these Terms (and for clarity, all other references to “you” in these Terms refer to such entity). For clarity, these Terms updated and replaced the Facebook Platform Policy and the Instagram Platform Policy and any references in existing terms, policies, or agreements to the “Facebook Platform Policy,” “Instagram Platform Policy,” or “Platform Policy” shall now mean these Terms.
    
*     
    e. If you fail to comply with these Terms or any other applicable terms or policies, we may suspend or terminate your App or account, as described below.
    
*     
    f. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein (including in Section 12 (“Glossary”) have the meaning given in our other terms and policies, including our [Terms of Service](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms) and our [Facebook Commercial Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/commercial_terms). The term “including” means “including without limitation.”

            2\. As between the parties, in connection with Platform, we won’t be subject to any terms or policies associated with your App or Your Content (even if we click or tap agreement). Those terms and policies are considered null and void and are rejected and excluded from these Terms.
            
        *     
            3\. Nothing in these Terms will be interpreted as a representation or agreement that we will not develop or have not developed apps, products, features, or services that are similar to your App or compete with your App.
            
        
    *

        iii. If your App contains content submitted or provided by your Users or other third parties, you must have an appropriate notice and takedown process and otherwise comply with all applicable laws and regulations to respond to notices of claimed infringement.
