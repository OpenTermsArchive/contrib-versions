If you are 13 or older but under the age of majority in your country of residence, you must review this Agreement with your parent or guardian to make sure that you and your parent or guardian understand it. Parents or guardians should also remind any minors that conversing with strangers on the Internet can be dangerous and take appropriate precautions to protect children, including monitoring their use of the Service.

To use the Service, you cannot be a person barred from receiving the Service under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdictions, including the country in which you reside or from where you use the Service. By accepting this Agreement, you represent that you understand and agree to the foregoing.

Use of the Service requires compatible devices, Internet access, and certain software (fees may apply). may require periodic updates. and may be affected by the performance of these factors. Apple reserves the right to limit the number of Accounts that may be created from a device and the number of devices associated with an Account. High-speed Internet access is strongly recommended for use. The latest version of required software is recommended to access the Service and may be required for certain transactions or features. You agree that meeting these requirements, which may change from time to time, is your responsibility.

Use of Location-based Services

Apple and its partners and licensors may provide certain features or services through the Service (e.g. Find My iPhone, Find My Friends) that rely upon device-based location information, which use GPS (where available), along with crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower locations. To provide such features or services, where available, Apple and its partners and licensors must collect, use, transmit, process and maintain your location data, including but not limited to the geographic location of your device and information related to your iCloud account (“Account”) and any devices registered thereunder, including but not limited to your Apple ID, device ID and name, and device type. You hereby agree and consent to Apple's and its partners' and licensors' collection, use, transmission, processing and maintenance of such location and account data to provide and improve such features or services.

You may withdraw this consent at any time by not using the location-based features and turning off the Find My iPhone, Find My Friends, or Location Services settings (as applicable) on your device and computer. When using third party services that use or provide location data as part of the Service, you are subject to and should review such third party's terms and privacy policy on use of location data by such third party services. Any location data provided by the Service is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may lead to death, personal injury, property or environmental damage. Apple shall use reasonable skill and due care in providing the Service, but neither Apple nor any of its content providers guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of location data or any other data displayed by the Service.

Find My iPhone

The Find My iPhone and Find My Mac features are intended for your personal use only. When enabled on your device or Mac, this feature can be used to locate, play a sound on, remotely enable Lost Mode, or remotely wipe your own device or Mac. Devices must be on and connected to the Internet (via a data network such as 3G or a registered Wi-Fi network) to be located. Macs must be on and not asleep, connected to the Internet, with Wi-Fi on and within the range of a registered Wi-Fi network to be located. If your missing device has Lost Mode enabled, it can keep track of its recent locations where it was powered on and connected to the Internet, and show you the history of those locations for the last 24 hours, when you locate the device using Find My iPhone. If your device or Mac has been remotely wiped, you cannot locate, play a sound on, or cancel the remote wipe for that device or Mac, or enable Lost Mode for that device. Location requests will impact battery life of the located device or Mac. If you believe your device or Mac has been stolen you should seek assistance from your local law enforcement and use the features of Find My iPhone such as remotely locking or wiping your device or Mac to protect your data. Once you have requested your device’s or Mac’s location, and the device or Mac has been located on a map, you can view the last location of your device or Mac after your initial request for a period of up to 24 hours. Apple then deletes that information within 24 hours of your initial request. THE LOCATION-BASED SERVICES OF THIS FEATURE ARE NOT INTENDED OR SUITABLE FOR USE AS AN EMERGENCY LOCATOR SYSTEM.

Find My Friends

The Find My Friends app, available for download from the App Store (compatible hardware and software required), allows you to share your location with a limited number of other users via your devices, upon acceptance of requests from those users. You may also view the location of a limited number of other users who have accepted your requests to do so, via their devices. You may set your device to automatically notify other users when you leave or arrive at a location, and, after you have established a friend relationship, set your device to notify you when those users leave or arrive at a location. You may also choose to temporarily share your location with a limited number of groups set up by you or another user, and see locations of all members of those groups. You may temporarily hide your device’s location from all other users. You may revoke acceptance of another user’s permission to see your location. You may turn off the feature by signing out of or uninstalling the Find My Friends app from your device. You may also use restrictions in iOS settings to prevent unauthorized changes to the settings you have selected, including acceptance of follow requests or hiding location. Location requests will impact battery life of the located device. THE LOCATION-BASED SERVICES OF THIS FEATURE ARE NOT INTENDED OR SUITABLE FOR USE AS AN EMERGENCY LOCATOR SYSTEM.

Backup

Automatic backup is available for iOS devices, and occurs periodically, when the device is screen locked, connected to a power source, and connected to the Internet via a Wi-Fi network. iCloud will store your last three backups. however, if a device has not backed up to iCloud for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days, Apple reserves the right to delete the backups associated with that device. Backup is limited to device settings, device characteristics, photos and videos, messages (iMessage, SMS, and MMS), ringtones, app data, location settings (such as location-based reminders that you have set up), and Home screen and app organization. Content purchased from the iTunes Store, App Store, or iBookstore is not backed up, but may be eligible for download from those services, subject to account requirements, availability, and the applicable terms and conditions. Media obtained from other sources (such as imported music or home videos) are not backed up, but can be synced from your computer by using iTunes. Your iCloud email, contacts, calendars, bookmarks, and documents are stored in, and can be accessed from, iCloud. Apple shall use reasonable skill and due care in providing the Service, but, TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW, APPLE DOES NOT GUARANTEE OR WARRANT THAT ANY CONTENT YOU MAY STORE OR ACCESS THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO INADVERTENT DAMAGE, CORRUPTION, LOSS, OR REMOVAL IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND APPLE SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE SHOULD SUCH DAMAGE, CORRUPTION, LOSS, OR REMOVAL OCCUR. It is your responsibility to maintain appropriate alternate backup of your information and data.

When iCloud Backup is enabled, your device will not back up to iTunes automatically during a sync, but you may choose to manually initiate a backup to iTunes.

Photo Stream

When My Photo Stream is enabled on your device or computer, new photos taken on your device or imported to your computer will be uploaded to iCloud, and then automatically downloaded to your other devices or computers on which My Photo Stream is also enabled. The downloaded photos will appear in a My Photo Stream view or folder on the device. When Shared Photo Streams is enabled, you may share selected photo streams with others on compatible systems, or publicly on the Internet, by creating a shared photo stream. The users with whom you share your photo streams may comment on the photos, and those comments will be shared with other users with whom you have shared the photo stream. Photo resolution may vary according to the device to which they are downloaded. A Wi-Fi connection is required for use of My Photo Stream on devices. Shared photo streams will use a cellular connection if Wi-Fi is not available. Apple reserves the right to place limits on the number and/or size of photos that can be uploaded during a given time period in order to limit unintended or excessive use of the service.

Photos uploaded to photo stream for use with My Photo Stream will be deleted from iCloud thirty (30) days after they are uploaded. Devices store a limited number of the most recent photos in the My Photo Stream album or view. the oldest photos in excess of the current limitation will be automatically deleted as new photo stream photos are downloaded. Photos in shared photo streams are not deleted after thirty (30) days, but the size of any given photo stream may be subject to photo or recipient number, and/or size limitations. Downloaded photos can be manually saved to the iOS Camera Roll.

Apple reserves the right to modify or terminate the Service (or any part thereof), either temporarily or permanently. Apple may post on our website and/or will send an email to the primary address associated with your Account to provide notice of any material changes to the Service. It is your responsibility to check your iCloud email address and/or primary email address registered with Apple for any such notices. You agree that Apple shall not be liable to you or any third party for any modification or cessation of the Service. If you have paid to use the Service and we terminate it or materially downgrade its functionality, we will provide you with a pro rata refund of any pre-payment.

If your use of the Service or other behavior intentionally or unintentionally threatens Apple’s ability to provide the Service or other systems, Apple shall be entitled to take all reasonable steps to protect the Service and Apple’s systems, which may include suspension of your access to the Service. Repeated violations of the limitations may result in termination of your Account.

Apple may make such Beta Features available to Program participants by online registration or enrollment via the Service. You understand and agree that Apple may collect and use certain information from your Account, devices and peripherals in order to enroll you in a Program and/or determine your eligibility to participate. You understand that once you enroll in a Program you may be unable to revert back to the earlier non-beta version of a given Beta Feature. In the event such reversion is possible, you may not be able to migrate data created within the Beta Feature back to the earlier non-beta version. Your use of the Beta Features and participation in the Program is governed by this Agreement and any additional license terms that may separately accompany the Beta Features. The Beta Features are provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis and may contain errors or inaccuracies that could cause failures, corruption or loss of data and/or information from your device and from peripherals (including, without limitation, servers and computers) connected thereto. Apple strongly encourages you to backup all data and information on your device and any peripherals prior to participating in any Program. You expressly acknowledge and agree that all use of the Beta Features is at your sole risk. YOU ASSUME ALL RISKS AND ALL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR PARTICIPATION IN ANY PROGRAM, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY INTERNET ACCESS FEES, BACKUP EXPENSES, COSTS INCURRED FOR THE USE OF YOUR DEVICE AND PERIPHERALS, AND ANY DAMAGE TO ANY EQUIPMENT, SOFTWARE, INFORMATION OR DATA. Apple may or may not provide you with technical and/or other support for the Beta Features. If support is provided it will be in addition to your normal support coverage for the Service and only available through the Program. You agree to abide by any support rules or policies that Apple provides to you in order to receive any such support. Apple reserves the right to modify the terms, conditions or policies of the Program (including ceasing the Program) at any time with or without notice, and may revoke your participation in the Program at any time.
