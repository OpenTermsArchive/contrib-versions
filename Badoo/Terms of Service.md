3.  If you post any content that actually belongs to someone else and they get annoyed (or even call in their lawyers), we are not responsible or liable. You have to take responsibility for what you post.
4.  Please refer to our Community Guidelines and Safety Tips for additional Dos and Don’ts, and information on staying safe.

1\. Use of the app and site and rules relating to Content

You are solely responsible for your compliance with all applicable local laws and regulations.

You further warrant that you have not been convicted of, nor are subject to any court order relating to assault, violence, sexual misconduct or harassment.

### What kind of content can I post or upload on Badoo?

You are able to post or upload all kinds of things on Badoo, including photographs, emails, text, messages and other content and digital media (“**Content**”). However, when you are using Badoo you may not post, send or upload any Content which:

1.  contains expletives or language which could be deemed offensive or is likely to harass, upset, embarrass, alarm or annoy any other person;
2.  is obscene, pornographic, illegal or otherwise may offend human dignity;
3.  is abusive, insulting or threatening, or which promotes, depicts or encourages violence, self-harm, suicide, racism, sexism, hatred or bigotry;
4.  encourages any illegal activity including, without limitation, terrorism and inciting racial hatred;
5.  is defamatory;
6.  relates to commercial activities (including, without limitation, sales, competitions and advertising, links to other websites or premium line telephone numbers);
7.  involves the transmission of “junk” mail or “spam”;
8.  impersonates a person, company or brand with the intent to deceive or confuse others;
9.  contains any spyware, adware, viruses, corrupt files, worm programs or other malicious code designed to interrupt, damage or limit the functionality of or disrupt any software, hardware, telecommunications, networks, servers or other equipment, Trojan horse or any other material designed to damage, interfere with, wrongly intercept or expropriate any data or personal data whether from Badoo or otherwise;
10.  itself, or the posting of which, violates any law or infringes any third party’s rights (including, without limitation, intellectual property rights, rights of publicity and privacy rights);
11.  includes the image of another person where such Content was created or distributed without that person’s knowledge, and without that person having been afforded an opportunity to refuse such creation or distribution; or
12.  contains images of children, even if you are also in the photo, or endangers or harms minors.

Please use your common sense when picking the Content that you choose to post on, upload or send via Badoo because you are solely responsible for, and bear all liability in relation to, such Content. You agree that you will not develop, support or use software, devices, scripts, robots, other types of mobile code or any other means or processes (including crawlers, browser plugins and add-on or other technology) to scrape or otherwise exfiltrate data or information from Badoo or its services, or otherwise copy profiles and other data from the services. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that you infringe our rules or violate the Terms, any Badoo user’s rights, or any third party’s rights, or if we are required to do so by applicable law, we may prevent you from using Badoo, we may disable your account or block you from further use of Badoo without notice and we may remove any such improper, infringing, or otherwise unauthorised Content you submit to Badoo.

### Are there any rules relating to personal data like my email address?

You may not display any personal contact or banking information on your individual profile page (“**Profile**”) whether in relation to you or any other person (for example, names, home addresses or postcodes, telephone numbers, email addresses, URLs, credit/debit card or other banking details, or place of work). If you do choose to reveal any personal data about yourself to other users, whether via email or otherwise, it is at your own risk. We encourage you to use the same caution in disclosing details about yourself to third parties online as you would under any other circumstances. You are required to follow our [Guidelines and Safety Tips](https://badoo.com/guidelines/) when doing so.

### What about other people’s personal data, can I use it?

You may only use other Badoo users’ personal data to the extent that your use of it matches Badoo’s purpose of allowing people to meet one another. You may not use other users' information for commercial purposes, to spam, to harass, stalk or to make unlawful threats. Badoo reserves the right to terminate your account, or prevent access to its features if you misuse other users' information.

### Some of my friends want to see all the people I’m chatting with. Can I tell them my password and let them log on as me?

The short answer is no. Only you are authorised to access your account with Badoo. You must not share your password with anyone or let anyone else access your account as this jeopardises the security of all of the Content and personal data that you have submitted to Badoo. You are responsible for keeping your password secret and secure. Badoo is not liable for any unauthorised access to your account. If you suspect that someone has gained access to your account, you must let us know immediately by visiting our [Feedback page](https://badoo.com/feedback/) and telling us of your suspicions or concerns. You must also immediately change your password. Badoo reserves the right to terminate your account if you violate our rules on keeping your password secure.

### Who can see the Content that I put on Badoo?

When you upload Content to Badoo it can be accessed and viewed by the general public. If you do not want such Content to be viewed by others, then you can opt to use the private folders and select the person to whom you wish to give access. If you still do not want such Content to be viewed by others, then you should not upload it to Badoo. We reserve the right (without obligation) at our sole discretion and without giving you notice, to remove or edit, limit or block access to any Content that you upload or submit to Badoo without any incurring liability to you. We have no obligation to display any Content that you submit to Badoo, nor to check the accuracy or truthfulness of any Content submitted to Badoo, nor to monitor your use or the use of other users of Badoo. Nonetheless, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to monitor any Content being uploaded to Badoo (including the Content you post), and by entering into these Terms, you acknowledge and agree that we may engage in such monitoring.

### Anything else I need to know?

When you use Badoo you agree to the Terms, and in return we grant you a limited, personal, non-exclusive and non-transferable licence to use and to upload Content and to use Badoo solely for your personal use. Apart from this licence, and the rights you retain in the Content that you submit to Badoo, you have no other rights in the use of Badoo, or its Content, features, database(s) or software, and you may not modify, edit, copy, reproduce, create derivative works of, reverse engineer, alter, enhance, scrape, disable, decompile, analyse or in any way exploit any of the foregoing in any manner. If you breach any of the Terms, the above licence will terminate automatically and you must immediately destroy any downloaded, printed or otherwise obtained Content. Furthermore, with respect to any mobile application downloaded from the Apple App Store, you will only use the application on an Apple-branded product that runs the iOS (Apple’s proprietary operating system), and (b) as permitted by the “Usage Rules” set forth in the Apple App Store Terms of Service.

2\. Ownership of Content
------------------------

### Once I have uploaded Content on Badoo, do I still own it?

Yes (provided you are the rightful owner in the first place — please see our other rules regarding posting Content that doesn’t belong to you).

Please note though that by posting, uploading or sending Content on Badoo you represent and warrant to us that you exclusively own such Content and/or otherwise have the right to grant us the rights to use such Content in accordance with these Terms.

Please note that by posting, uploading or sending Content on Badoo you automatically grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty free, perpetual, worldwide licence to use such Content in any way (including, without limitation, editing, copying, modifying, adapting, translating, reformatting, creating derivative works from, incorporating into other works, advertising, distributing and otherwise making available to the general public such Content, whether in whole or in part and in any format or medium currently known or developed in the future).

We may assign and/or sub-license the above licence to our affiliates and successors without any further approval by, or notice to, you.

We have the right to disclose your identity to any third party who claims that any Content posted or uploaded by you to Badoo constitutes a violation of their intellectual property, privacy or other rights.

So that we can prevent the unconsented use of any Content that you have posted, uploaded or sent on Badoo by other members or third parties outside of Badoo, you authorise us to act on your behalf with respect to such infringing and/or unauthorised uses. This expressly includes the authority, but not the obligation, to send notices pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3) (i.e., DMCA Takedown Notices) on your behalf if the Content that you have posted, uploaded or sent on Badoo is taken and used by third parties outside of Badoo.

### Who does the rest of the Content on Badoo belong to then?

Us! The rest of the Content, including text, graphics, user interfaces, trademarks, logos, sounds and artwork on Badoo, as well as the Badoo software and database(s) are owned, controlled or licensed by us and our suppliers and are protected by copyright, trademark, database rights and/or other intellectual property law rights.

### Can I use any of the Content that doesn’t belong to me?

Other than in relation to Content submitted by you to Badoo, and apart from the licence we grant to you under these Terms, you do not have any rights in relation to the Content on Badoo and you agree that you will not use any Content in any manner which may infringe our or any third party’s rights. All other rights that are not expressly granted under these Terms are reserved by Badoo and its licensors. This means that you agree that you will not copy, modify, adapt, distribute, publish or sell all or any part of Badoo or the Content contained on Badoo (other than the Content submitted by you).

3\. Paid for services
---------------------

### What can I buy on Badoo?

Badoo offers you the opportunity to pay for certain services offered on Badoo (“**Premium Services**”). Badoo’s Premium Services include various opportunities to find and meet additional people, to customise your profile and to boost your profile so more people find you. All of these Premium Services can be purchased after you register, and you may subscribe to the Premium Services for various lengths of time as described within Badoo.

You may also buy credits that may be redeemed towards Premium Services (each, a “**Credit**”).

Paid for services are not available in sanctioned countries.

### How do payments generally work?

If you order any Premium Services or Credits on Badoo, you agree to pay for them in accordance with the billing terms in effect at the time of purchase. You may purchase Premium Services or Credits through the following payment methods (each, a “**Premium Payment Method**”): (a) making a purchase through a third party platform such as the Apple App Store or Google Play Store (each, a “**Third Party Store**”), or (b) paying with any credit or debit card that we accept or (c) a PayPal account or (d) any other payment method available to you at your current location from time to time. Once you have requested a Premium Service or Credit, you authorise us to charge your chosen Premium Payment Method. If we do not receive payment from your chosen Premium Payment Method, you agree to promptly pay all amounts due upon demand by us.

### Can I automatically refill my credits?

Yes. Badoo may also offer users the ability to automatically refill their Credits with our Auto Top-up feature (“**Auto Top-up**”). By default, our Auto Top-up feature is turned on, your Credits will be automatically refilled to an amount equal to the amount you initially paid using such feature and your Premium Payment Method will be automatically charged when your Account has 200 Credits or less. You can change your Auto Top-up at any time in your payment settings on your account’s profile page. The pricing may vary due to a number of factors, such as (but not limited to) promotional offers, loyalty bonuses and other discounts.

### How do I cancel automatic renewal of my Premium Services with Badoo?

Premium Services may be provided as automatically-renewing subscriptions (e.g., an automatically renewing one-week subscription, one-month subscription, or three-month subscription.). **IF YOU PURCHASE AN AUTOMATICALLY RENEWING SUBSCRIPTION, YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL RENEW AT THE END OF THE INITIAL SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD AND EACH SUBSEQUENT RENEWAL PERIOD AT BADOOS THEN CURRENT PRICE FOR SUCH SUBSCRIPTION, UNLESS YOU CANCEL.** To avoid charges for a new subscription period, you must cancel at least twenty four (24) hours before the end of the prior subscription period as described below. Deleting your account or deleting the application from your device **DOES NOT** cancel your subscription. You will be given notice of changes in the pricing of the Premium Services for which you have subscriptions and an opportunity to cancel. If Badoo Group changes these prices and you do not cancel your subscription, you agree that you will be charged at Badoo Group’s then-current pricing for subscription.

If you purchased Premium Services or a subscription directly from Badoo Group, you may change your Premium Payment Method via the payment settings option under your profile. If you purchased a subscription directly from Badoo Group or the Google Play Store and you would like to cancel your subscription, you may do this following the instructions in the App – cancelling your Premium Payment Method **DOES NOT** cancel the subscription. If you purchased a subscription through the Apple App Store, you will need to access your account with Apple and follow instructions to change or cancel your subscription. If you cancel your subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of the period you last paid for, but your subscription will not be renewed when that period expires and you will then no longer be able to use the Premium Services enabled by your subscription.

### Do my credits last forever?

No. Unused Credits expire 6 months after the date of purchase (unless the credits are purchased through the Apple App Store). If you delete your account or if your account is terminated by us due to breach of these Terms, you will lose any accumulated credits. If you receive free or promotional credits, we may expire them at any time. Credits are not redeemable for any sum of money or monetary value from us unless we agree otherwise in writing.

4\. Access to the app and site
------------------------------

### Do you guarantee that Badoo will be up and running at all times?

Unfortunately we can’t guarantee that because sometimes we have to carry out maintenance to the app or site or they may be affected by a fault or circumstances which are outside our control, so Badoo is provided on an “as is” “as available” basis. No warranty is given about the quality, accuracy, functionality, availability or performance of Badoo and we reserve the right to suspend, withdraw, amend, modify or vary the service provided on Badoo without notice and without incurring any liability to you.

### What about mobile access?

You are responsible for making all the necessary arrangements to ensure you can access Badoo (including, but not limited to Internet provider and mobile internet provider fees and, any other charges associated with such access). We shall not be held responsible for any reduced functionality you may encounter as result of or in connection with accessing Badoo through mobile services or any similar service currently known or developed in the future.

By accessing Badoo or agreeing to receive messages or notifications from Badoo through your mobile phone and/or any other connected media device, you accept that you may incur charges from your internet or mobile service provider. We shall not under any circumstances be liable for such charges.

### I’m not registered and I can’t seem to access some Content or features on the app or site. Why is that?

Non-registered users are able to access only that portion of Badoo that is publicly available. They will not have a Profile but may have limited ability to upload any Content. The extent of registered users’ access to Badoo will depend on certain criteria relating to their Profile being met. We may change or update the criteria from time to time without prior notice and at our discretion.

5\. Termination of use by you
-----------------------------

### They say that you can have too much of a good thing… what do I do if I want to “unregister” myself from Badoo?

If you have registered on Badoo, you can terminate your registration at any time by going to the ‘Settings’ control on Badoo when you are logged in and choosing the ‘delete profile’ link. We save your profile information in case you later decide to restore your account. Many users deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and in doing so expect us to maintain their information until they return to Badoo. You will therefore be able to restore your account and your profile in its entirety within 28 days of de-activating it. Once your registration is terminated, we have the right to delete any related Content that you have submitted or uploaded on to Badoo. For further details, please refer to our [Privacy Policy](https://badoo.com/privacy/).

Content that you have uploaded to Badoo, other than your Profile (such as comments or email messages), may still appear on Badoo following termination of your registration.

6\. Abuse/Complaints
--------------------

### Someone is not obeying the Terms, who do I tell?

You can report any abuse or complain about Content on Badoo by contacting us via [Feedback page](https://badoo.com/feedback/), outlining the abuse and or complaint. You can also report a user directly from a profile, by clicking the ‘Report Abuse’ link on their profile, choosing the reason for the complaint and providing us with any additional information you think fit.

We will always try our best to help resolve any issue that you may encounter with our service. If your complaint or dispute remains unresolved, however, you may be eligible to use the European Commission’s online dispute resolution platform [here](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/odr/main/index.cfm?event=main.home.chooseLanguage).

7\. Privacy Policy
------------------

### Do you have guidelines in place about what you can do with my personal data?

We process information in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://badoo.com/privacy/) which is incorporated into these Terms and Conditions of Use. Please read the terms of our [Privacy Policy](https://badoo.com/privacy/) prior to using Badoo. By using Badoo, you agree to such processing and you warrant that all data provided by you is true, correct and accurate.

8\. Links
---------

### Are the links on the app or site anything to do with Badoo?

Badoo may contain links to other sites, resources and purchase opportunities provided by third parties. These links are provided to you for your information only. If you access these links you may be directed to third party sites. These third party sites will have their own terms of use and privacy policies, which may differ from the Terms. The display of links to third party sites does not constitute an endorsement by us of any of the third party content information, sites, or resources provided.

Please note that we have no control over the contents of any third party sites or resources, and we accept no responsibility for them, including (but not limited to) the third party site’s compliance with any applicable laws or regulations.

9\. Disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability
--------------------------------------------------------

### I forgot the rules about conduct on here and now someone is threatening to sue me. Will your lawyers sort it out?

No. If you act in a way that upsets other users then you have to be responsible for the consequences. We expressly disclaim any and all responsibility and liability for your conduct or the conduct of any other user of Badoo, and expressly disclaim any liability for Content uploaded by you or by any other user.

10\. Indemnity
--------------

### I forgot the rules about conduct on here and now someone is threatening to sue YOU. What now?

If we are sued as a result of your use of Badoo then we have the right to defend or settle the relevant claim as we see fit. If we ask, you will co-operate fully and reasonably as required by us in the defence of any relevant claim.

Badoo retains the exclusive right to settle, compromise and pay any and all Claims or causes of action which are brought against us without your prior consent.

11\. Miscellaneous
------------------

### What about all of those standard clauses that you see at the end of most contracts? They’re the best bit!

As you asked so nicely…

The Terms and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be are governed by and construed in accordance with English law. In the event there is a discrepancy between this English language version and any translated copies of the Website Terms and Conditions, the English version shall prevail.

We reserve the right to modify, amend or change the Terms at any time (a “**Change**”). If we do this then the Changes will be posted on this page and we will indicate the effective date of the updates at the bottom of the Terms. In certain circumstances, we may send an email to you notifying you of any Change. You should regularly check this page to take notice of any Changes.

If you do not accept any Change to the Terms, you should stop using Badoo immediately. Your continued use of Badoo following any Change constitutes your acceptance of the Change and you will be legally bound by the new updated Terms.

If, for any reason, any of the Terms are declared to be illegal, invalid or otherwise unenforceable by a court of a competent jurisdiction, then to the extent that term is illegal, invalid or unenforceable, it shall be severed and deleted from the Terms and the remainder of the Terms shall survive, remain in full force and effect and continue to be binding and enforceable.
