Badoo’s Terms and Conditions of Use
===================================

If you live outside the United States, these Terms and Conditions apply to you. If you live in the United States, the Badoo Terms and Conditions available [here (opens in new window)](https://badoo.com/en-us/terms/) apply to you.

The Summary
-----------

Hello. You should read these terms and conditions in full because they apply every time you visit Badoo and use any of its features. However, just in case you ever need a reminder of the main points, here’s a quick summary:

1. If you are under the age of 18 then unfortunately you can’t use Badoo yet because it’s a meeting place for adults only.
2. We’re not responsible for anything that you post or say while you are on Badoo and we don’t assume any obligation to monitor the content of the site, but if we do see or someone alerts us that you have posted something that we think is inappropriate then we are allowed at our discretion to remove it.
3. If you post any content that actually belongs to someone else and they get annoyed (or even call in their lawyers), we are not in the firing line. You have to take responsibility for what you post.
4. Please refer to our Community Guidelines and Safety Tips for additional Dos and Don’ts, and information on staying safe.
5. If you are concerned about how your data is being used by Badoo then please refer to our [Privacy Policy (opens in new window)](https://badoo.com/en/privacy/), which explains how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use Badoo. By using Badoo, you acknowledge that we can use such data in accordance with our Privacy Policy. Our website and apps also use cookies or similar technologies which we tell you more about on our [Privacy Policy (opens in new window)](https://badoo.com/privacy/#cookies) page. You may set your browser and your mobile settings to block cookies and local storage devices, but if you do so, you may not be able to access the features that Badoo offers.

The full legal bit
------------------

Badoo is a social media website and app designed as a forum for meeting new people, a place to have discussions and to share photos, news and information. It is intended to be a fun place to visit and it is important to us (and for you) that it remains a safe and friendly environment so you agree that you will only use Badoo in a manner consistent with its purpose and which is in accordance with these terms and conditions, as well as the Badoo Community Guidelines and Safety Tips (the “**Terms**”). When we mention Badoo, we mean www.badoo.com, together with affiliated websites and applications.

The Terms constitute a binding legal agreement between you as user (“**you**”) and the Badoo Group (“we” or “us”). The Badoo Group includes, but is not limited to, Badoo Trading Limited (an English company whose registered office is at 1 Blossom Yard, Fourth Floor, London E1 6RS), Social Online Payments Limited (a company incorporated in Ireland under company number 496494) and Social Online Payments, Inc. (a company incorporated in Delaware under company number 5214252).

The Terms apply whenever you visit Badoo, whether or not you have chosen to register with us, so please read them carefully. By accessing, using, registering for or receiving services offered on Badoo you are accepting and agreeing to be bound by the Terms.

IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT AND AGREE TO THE TERMS THEN YOU MUST NOT ACCESS OR USE THE APP OR SITE.

1\. Use of the app and site and rules relating to Content
---------------------------------------------------------

### Who can use Badoo?

Badoo is a meeting place for adults. You may only use Badoo, including any of its features, or become a registered member if you are 18 years old or older (or the age of majority in the country in which you reside if that happens to be greater than 18).

You warrant that you have the right, authority and capacity to enter into and be bound by the Terms and that by using Badoo you will not be violating any law or regulation of the country in which you are resident. You are solely responsible for your compliance with all applicable local laws and regulations. Unfortunately, we cannot allow you to use another person’s Badoo account or to share your Badoo account with any other person without permission. You are responsible for ensuring that any use of your account complies with these Terms.

You further warrant that you have not been convicted of, nor are subject to any court order relating to assault, violence, sexual misconduct or harassment.

### What kind of content can I post or upload on Badoo?

You are able to post or upload all kinds of things on Badoo, including photographs, emails, messages and other content (“**Content**”).

There are some rules about what is acceptable though, so when you are using Badoo you may not post, send or upload any Content which:

1. is illegal or encourages, promotes or incites any illegal activity;
2. is harmful to minors;
3. is defamatory or libelous;
4. itself, or the posting of which, infringes any third party’s rights (including, without limitation, intellectual property rights and privacy rights);
5. shows another person which was created or distributed without that person’s consent;
6. contains language or imagery which could be deemed offensive or is likely to harass, upset, embarrass, alarm or annoy any other person;
7. is obscene, pornographic, violent or otherwise may offend human dignity;
8. is abusive, insulting or threatening, discriminatory or which promotes, depicts or encourages racism, sexism, hatred or bigotry;
9. relates to commercial activities (including, without limitation, sales, competitions and advertising, links to other websites or premium line telephone numbers);
10. involves the transmission of “junk” mail or “spam”;
11. impersonates or intends to deceive or manipulate a person (including, without limitation, scams and inauthentic behaviour);
12. contains any spyware, adware, viruses, corrupt files, worm programmes or other malicious code designed to interrupt, damage or limit the functionality of or disrupt any software, hardware, telecommunications, networks, servers or other equipment, Trojan horse or any other material designed to damage, interfere with, wrongly intercept or expropriate any data or personal data whether from Badoo or otherwise; or
13. in any other way violates these Terms.

Please use your common sense when picking the Content that you choose to post on, upload or send via Badoo because you are solely responsible for, and bear all liability in relation to, such Content.

We use a combination of automated systems, user reports, and a team of moderators to monitor and review accounts and content to identify breaches of these Terms. If you repeatedly infringe our rules, you may be prevented from using Badoo and we may restrict your access to Badoo, disable your account or block you from further use of Badoo. We may also remove any Content you submit to Badoo if we believe it violates the Terms or we are required to do so by applicable law.

For users residing in the European Union (“EU”), we will notify you when we take action against your account or content unless it is not appropriate for us to do so (for example, we are not permitted by law enforcement agencies). For all other users, we reserve the right (without obligation) at our sole discretion and without giving you notice, to remove or edit, limit or block access to any Content that you upload or submit to Badoo without any incurring liability to you. If you believe that we’ve made a mistake in taking such action, you have the option to appeal our decision **within a six-month period**. If you wish to appeal a decision, please start by taking a moment to read the relevant section of our [Community Guidelines](https://badoo.com/terms/guidelines). If you still think there has been a mistake in the action taken on your account or Content, the best way to appeal is to fill out the appeals form linked in the notification shown to you within the app at the time. Alternatively, you can contact us [here](https://badoo.com/terms/feedback) (please explain why you are appealing our decision, and give as much detail as you can).

For users residing in the EU, you have additional rights under the Digital Services Act to: (i) access third party out-of-court dispute settlement processes; (ii) seek remedies from the courts in the EU member state in which you live; and (iii) lodge a complaint with your local EU regulatory authority. For users residing in the UK, you have a right under local law to bring a claim for breach of contract if you believe we have breached the Terms by removing, restricting or limiting access to, or distribution of, your Content, or suspending or terminating your account.

We have no obligation to display any Content that you submit to Badoo, nor to check the accuracy or truthfulness of any Content submitted to Badoo, nor to monitor your use or the use of other users of Badoo.

### Are there any rules relating to personal data like my email address?

You may not display any personal contact or banking information on your individual profile page (“**Profile**”) whether in relation to you or any other person (for example, names, home addresses or postcodes, telephone numbers, email addresses, URLs, credit/debit card or other banking details, or place of work). If you do choose to reveal any personal data about yourself to other users, whether via email or otherwise, it is at your own risk. We encourage you to use the same caution in disclosing details about yourself to third parties online as you would under any other circumstances. You are required to follow our [Guidelines and Safety Tips](https://badoo.com/terms/guidelines) when doing so.

### What about other people’s personal data, can I use it?

You may only use other Badoo users’ personal data to the extent that your use of it matches Badoo’s purpose of allowing people to meet one another. You may not use other users' information for commercial purposes, to spam, to harass, or to make unlawful threats. Badoo reserves the right to terminate your account, or prevent access to its features if you misuse other users' information.

### Who can see the Content that I put on Badoo?

When you upload Content to Badoo it can be accessed and viewed by the general public. If you do not want such Content to be viewed by others, then you can opt to use the private folders and select the person to whom you wish to give access. If you still do not want such Content to be viewed by others, then you should not upload it to Badoo.

### Anything else I need to know?

When you use Badoo you agree to the Terms, and in return we grant you a limited, personal, non-exclusive and non-transferable licence to use and to upload Content and to use Badoo solely for your personal use. Apart from this licence, you have no other rights in the use of the site, app, or its Content or features, and you may not modify, edit, copy, reproduce, create derivative works of, reverse engineer, alter, enhance or in any way exploit any of the site or Content in any manner. If you breach any of the Terms, the above licence will terminate automatically and you must immediately destroy any downloaded or printed Content.

We have developed matching algorithms to predict your compatibility with other users and so we can show you people we think are a good match for you. You can learn more about our use of recommender systems and the main parameters we use in our [Privacy Policy (opens in new window)](https://badoo.com/en/privacy/).

2\. Ownership of Content
------------------------

### Once I have uploaded Content on Badoo, do I still own it?

Yes (provided you are the rightful owner in the first place - please see our other rules regarding posting Content that doesn’t belong to you).

Please note though that by posting, uploading or sending Content on Badoo you represent and warrant to us that:

1. you are either the exclusive author or owner of that Content and in all cases you agree that you waive any and all moral rights relating to that Content (including, without limitation, any rights to be identified as the author);
2. you have been granted a licence that allows you to use, post or upload the Content; or
3. you have obtained appropriate consent or authority to use, post or upload such Content.

Please note that by posting, uploading or sending Content on Badoo you represent and warrant to us that you have the right to do so, and automatically grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty free, perpetual, worldwide licence to use such Content in any way (including, without limitation, editing, copying, modifying, adapting, translating, reformatting, creating derivative works from, incorporating into other works, advertising, distributing and otherwise making available to the general public such Content, whether in whole or in part and in any format or medium currently known or developed in the future).

We may assign and/or sub-license the above licence to our affiliates and successors without any further approval by you.

We have the right to disclose your identity to any third party who is claiming that any Content posted or uploaded by you to our app or site constitutes a violation of their intellectual property rights or of their right to privacy or any other law.

### Who does the rest of the Content on Badoo belong to then?

Us! All text, graphics, user interfaces, trademarks, logos, sounds and artwork on Badoo are owned, controlled or licensed by us and are protected by copyright, trademark and other intellectual property law rights.

### Can I use any of the Content that doesn’t belong to me?

Other than in relation to Content submitted by you to Badoo, you do not have any rights in relation to the Content on Badoo and you agree that you will not use any Content in any manner which may infringe ours or any third party’s rights. This means that you agree that you will not copy, modify, adapt, distribute, publish or sell all or any part of the Badoo site or the Content contained on it (other than the Content submitted by you) to anyone else.

3\. Paid for services
---------------------

### What can I buy on Badoo?

Badoo offers you the opportunity to pay for certain services offered on Badoo (“**Premium Services**”). Badoo’s Premium Services include various opportunities to find and meet additional people, to customise your profile and to boost your profile so more people find you. All of these Premium Services can be purchased after you register, and you may subscribe to the Premium Services for various lengths of time as described within Badoo.

You may also buy credits that may be redeemed towards Premium Services (each, a “**Credit**”).

Paid for services are not available in sanctioned countries.

### How do payments generally work?

If you order any Premium Services or Credits on Badoo, you agree to pay for them in accordance with the billing terms in effect at the time of purchase. You may purchase Premium Services or Credits through the following payment methods (each, a “**Premium Payment Method**”): (a) making a purchase through a third party platform such as the Apple App Store or Google Play Store (each, a “**Third Party Store**”), or (b) paying with any credit or debit card that we accept, or (c) a PayPal account, or (d) any other payment method available to you at your current location from time to time. Once you have requested a Premium Service or Credit, you authorise us to charge your chosen Premium Payment Method. If we do not receive payment from your chosen Premium Payment Method, you agree to promptly pay all amounts due upon demand by us.

### Can I automatically top-up my credits?

Yes. Badoo may also offer users the ability to automatically top-up their Credits with our Auto Top-up feature (“**Auto Top-up**”). By default, our Auto Top-up feature is turned on, your Credits will be automatically topped-up to an amount equal to the amount you initially paid using such feature and your Premium Payment Method will be automatically charged when your Account has 200 Credits or less. You can change your Auto Top-up at any time in your payment settings on your account’s profile page. The pricing may vary due to a number of factors, such as (but not limited to) promotional offers, loyalty bonuses and other discounts.

### How do I cancel automatic renewal of my Premium Services with Badoo?

Premium Services may be provided as automatically-renewing subscriptions (e.g., an automatically renewing one-week subscription, one-month subscription, or three-month subscription.). IF YOU PURCHASE AN AUTOMATICALLY RENEWING SUBSCRIPTION, YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL RENEW AT THE END OF THE INITIAL SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD AND EACH SUBSEQUENT RENEWAL PERIOD AT BADOO’S THEN CURRENT PRICE FOR SUCH SUBSCRIPTION, UNLESS YOU CANCEL. To avoid charges for a new subscription period, you must cancel at least twenty four (24) hours before the end of the prior subscription period as described below. Deleting your account or deleting the application from your device DOES NOT cancel your subscription. You will be given notice of changes in the pricing of the Premium Services for which you have subscriptions and an opportunity to cancel. If Badoo Group changes these prices and you do not cancel your subscription, you agree that you will be charged at Badoo Group’s then-current pricing for the subscription.

If you purchased Premium Services or a subscription directly from Badoo Group, you may change your Premium Payment Method via the payment settings option under your profile. If you purchased a subscription directly from Badoo Group or the Google Play Store and you would like to cancel your subscription, you may do this following the instructions in the App – cancelling your Premium Payment Method DOES NOT cancel the subscription. If you purchased a subscription through the Apple App Store, you will need to access your account with Apple and follow instructions to change or cancel your subscription. If you cancel your subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of the period you last paid for, but your subscription will not be renewed when that period expires and you will then no longer be able to use the Premium Services enabled by your subscription.

Because the Badoo app may be utilised without a subscription, cancelling your Premium Services subscription does not remove your profile from our app. If you wish to fully terminate your account, you must terminate your account as set forth in Section 5.

The Badoo Group operates a global business, and our pricing varies by a number of factors. We frequently offer promotional rates - which can vary based on region, length of subscription, bundle size and more. We also regularly test new features and payment options. The Badoo Group reserves the right, including without prior notice, to limit the available quantity of or discontinue making available any product, feature, service or other offering; to impose conditions on the honouring of any coupon, discount, offer or other promotion; to bar any user from making any transaction; and to refuse to provide any user with any product, service or other offering or to honour any offer.

**Free Trials.** If you sign up for a free trial and do not cancel, your trial may convert into a paid subscription and your Premium Payment Method will be charged at the then-current price for such subscription. Once your free trial converts to a paid subscription, your paid subscription will continue to automatically renew at the end of each period, and your Premium Payment Method will be charged, until you cancel. To avoid charges for a new subscription period, you must cancel before the end of the then-current subscription period or free trial period as described above. Deleting your account or deleting the application from your device does not cancel your free trial. If you have signed up for a free trial on Badoo through the Apple Store or Google Play Store previously, you will not be eligible for another free trial and you will then be automatically signed up to a subscription and charged as described in this paragraph.

### When can I seek a refund?

Generally, all charges for purchases are nonrefundable, and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods.

However:

For subscribers residing anywhere outside the US:

Subscribers who purchase weekly subscriptions are entitled to a refund of the price of the subscription (minus the value of any portion of the subscription used at the date the refund is requested) if requested within the first 6 days after the subscription starts.

Subscribers who purchase monthly or longer subscriptions are entitled to a refund of the price of the subscription (minus the value of any portion of the subscription used at the date the refund is requested) if requested within the first 14 days after the subscription starts.

There are no refunds for subscription renewals. Blocked members are not entitled to refunds.

To request a refund:

In addition to cancelling, eligible subscribers must request a refund to receive one.

If you subscribed through Google and reside outside the US, refunds are handled by Google, not Badoo. To request a refund, go to the Google Play Store app, select your order history, find the transaction, select “Report a Problem” and submit your refund request.

If you subscribed using your Apple ID, refunds are handled by Apple, (regardless of where you live), not Badoo. To request a refund, go to iTunes, click on your Apple ID, select “Purchase history,” find the transaction and hit “Report Problem”. You can also submit a request at Apple Support.

For all other purchases: please contact customer support with your order number (you can find the order number in the order confirmation email, or if you purchased from the Google Play Store by logging in to Google Wallet).

### Can I transfer any of my Premium Services or Credits to another Badoo user?

The Premium Services and Credits are not transferable, whether for free or as a sale or barter transaction, and Badoo does not recognise any purported transfers of Premium Services or Credits. Accordingly, you may not trade, sell, gift or attempt to sell any Premium Services or Credits for value of any kind. Any such transfer or attempted transfer is prohibited and void, and will subject your account to termination.

### Do my credits last forever?

No. Unused Credits expire 6 months after the date of purchase (unless the credits are purchased through the Apple App Store). If you delete your account or if your account is terminated by us due to breach of these Terms, you will lose any accumulated credits. If you receive free or promotional credits, we may expire them at any time. Credits are not redeemable for any sum of money or monetary value from us unless we agree otherwise in writing.

### Bonus credits under Premium Services

If you receive bonus credits on credit packs bought as part of a premium feature (for example, as an Extra or Premium subscriber), we may change the percentage of bonus credits available as part of that feature at our discretion. Bonus credits apply to full-price credit packs only.

### Do sales taxes apply?

If Badoo Group determines it has a legal obligation to collect a Sales Tax from you, Badoo Group shall collect such Sales Tax in addition to the payments required under Section 3 of these Terms. If any Premium Services, or payments for any Premium Services, under these Terms are subject to any Sales Tax in any jurisdiction and you have not remitted the applicable Sales Tax to Badoo Group, you will be responsible for the payment of such Sales Tax and any related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority, and you will indemnify Badoo Group for any liability or expense Badoo Group may incur in connection with such Sales Taxes. Upon Badoo Group’s request, you will provide us with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or other such evidence that you have paid all applicable taxes. For purposes of this section, “Sales Tax” shall mean any sales or use tax and any other tax measured by sales proceeds that is the functional equivalent of a sales tax where the applicable taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise impose a sales or use tax.

### What about withholding taxes?

You agree to make all payments of fees to Badoo Group free and clear of, and without reduction for, any withholding taxes. Any such taxes imposed on payments of fees to Badoo Group will be your sole responsibility, and you will provide Badoo Group with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or such other evidence as we may reasonably request, to establish that such taxes have been paid.

4\. Access to the app and site
------------------------------

### Do you guarantee that Badoo will be up and running at all times?

Unfortunately we can’t guarantee that because sometimes we have to carry out maintenance to the app or site or they may be affected by a fault or circumstances which are outside our control, so Badoo is provided on an “as is” “as available” basis. No warranty is given about the quality, accuracy, functionality, availability or performance of Badoo and we reserve the right to suspend, withdraw, amend, modify or vary the service provided on Badoo without notice and without incurring any liability to you.

### What about mobile access?

You are responsible for making all the necessary arrangements to ensure you can access Badoo (including, but not limited to Internet provider and mobile internet provider fees and, any other charges associated with such access). We shall not be held responsible for any reduced functionality you may encounter as result of or in connection with accessing Badoo through mobile services or any similar service currently known or developed in the future.

By accessing Badoo or agreeing to receive messages or notifications from Badoo through your mobile phone and/or any other connected media device, you accept that you may incur charges from your internet or mobile service provider. We shall not under any circumstances be liable for such charges.

### I’m not registered and I can’t seem to access some Content or features on the app or site. Why is that?

Non-registered users are able to access only that portion of Badoo that is publicly available. They will not have a Profile but may have limited ability to upload any Content. The extent of registered users’ access to Badoo will depend on certain criteria relating to their Profile being met. We may change or update the criteria from time to time without prior notice and at our discretion.

5\. Termination of use by you
-----------------------------

### They say that you can have too much of a good thing... what do I do if I want to “unregister” myself from Badoo?

If you have registered on Badoo, you can terminate your registration at any time by going to the ‘Settings’ control on Badoo when you are logged in and choosing the ‘delete profile’ link. We save your profile information in case you later decide to restore your account. Many users deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and in doing so expect us to maintain their information until they return to Badoo. You will therefore be able to restore your account and your profile in its entirety within 28 days of de-activating it. Once your registration is terminated, we have the right to delete any related Content that you have submitted or uploaded on to Badoo. For further details, please refer to our [Privacy Policy (opens in new window)](https://badoo.com/en/privacy/).

Content that you have uploaded to Badoo, other than your Profile (such as comments or email messages), may still appear on Badoo following termination of your registration.

6\. Abuse/Complaints
--------------------

### Someone is not obeying the Terms, who do I tell?

You can report any abuse or complain about Content on Badoo by contacting us via [Feedback page](https://badoo.com/terms/feedback), outlining the abuse and or complaint. You can also report a user directly from a profile, by clicking the ‘Report Abuse’ link on their profile, choosing the reason for the complaint and providing us with any additional information you think fit.

We will always try our best to help resolve any issue that you may encounter with our service. If your complaint or dispute remains unresolved, however, you may be eligible to use the [European Commission’s online dispute resolution platform (opens in new window)](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/odr/main/index.cfm?event=main.home.chooseLanguage).

### Are other users vetted?

NO. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BADOO’S OPERATIONS, BADOO GROUP DOES NOT CONDUCT CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS ON ITS USERS OR OTHERWISE REGULARLY INQUIRE INTO THE BACKGROUNDS OF ITS USERS OR ATTEMPT TO VERIFY THE STATEMENTS OF ITS USERS. BADOO GROUP MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AS TO THE CONDUCT OF ANY USERS OR THEIR COMPATIBILITY WITH ANY CURRENT OR FUTURE USERS. BADOO GROUP RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT ANY CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK OR OTHER SCREENINGS (SUCH AS SEX OFFENDER REGISTER SEARCHES) AT ANY TIME AND TO USE AVAILABLE PUBLIC RECORDS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

We don’t control any of the things our users say or do. Though we set and enforce our Terms and take steps to try to prevent misbehaviour in the Badoo community, **we do not owe you a duty to protect you from any type of harm caused by other users.** You are solely responsible for your interactions with other users of Badoo.

You agree to, and hereby do, to the maximum extent permissible under applicable law, release Badoo Group and its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives and successors from any claims, demands, losses, damages, rights, and actions of any kind, including personal injuries, death and property damage, that either directly or indirectly arises from your interactions with or conduct of other users of Badoo.

7\. Privacy Policy
------------------

### Do you have guidelines in place about what you can do with my personal data?

We process information in accordance with our [Privacy Policy (opens in new window)](https://badoo.com/en/privacy/) which is incorporated into these Terms and Conditions of Use. Please read the terms of our [Privacy Policy (opens in new window)](https://badoo.com/en/privacy/) prior to using Badoo. By using Badoo, you agree to such processing and you warrant that all data provided by you is true, correct and accurate.

8\. Links
---------

### Are the links on the app or site anything to do with Badoo?

Badoo may contain links to other sites, resources and purchase opportunities provided by third parties. These links are provided to you for your information only. If you access these links you may be directed to third party sites. These third party sites will have their own terms of use and privacy policies, which may differ from the Terms. The display of links to third party sites does not constitute an endorsement by us of any of the third party content information, sites, or resources provided.

Please note that we have no control over the contents of any third party sites or resources, and we accept no responsibility for them, including (but not limited to) the third party site’s compliance with any applicable laws or regulations.

9\. Disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability
--------------------------------------------------------

### I forgot the rules about conduct on here and now someone is threatening to sue me. Will your lawyers sort it out?

No. If you act in a way that upsets other users then you have to be responsible for the consequences. We expressly disclaim any and all responsibility and liability for your conduct or the conduct of any other user of Badoo, and expressly disclaim any liability for Content uploaded by you or by any other user.

### My friend is a lawyer and says that you can’t exclude liability for everything...

Nothing in the Terms limits or excludes our liability for:

1. death or personal injury caused by our proven negligence;
2. fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; or
3. any liability which cannot be limited or excluded by law.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, Badoo expressly excludes:

1. all conditions, representations, warranties and other terms which might otherwise be implied by statute, common law or the law of equity; and
2. any liability incurred by you arising from use of Badoo, its services or these Terms, including without limitation for any claims, charges, demands, damages, liabilities, losses or expenses of whatever nature and howsoever direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages (however arising including negligence), loss of use, loss of data, loss caused by a computer or electronic virus, loss of income or profit, loss of or damage to property, wasted management or office time, breach of contract or claims of third parties or other losses of any kind or character, even if Badoo has been advised of the possibility of such damages or losses, arising out of or in connection with the use of Badoo. This limitation on liability applies to, but is not limited to, the transmission of any disabling device or virus that may infect your equipment, failure or mechanical or electrical equipment or communication lines, telephone or other interconnect problems (e.g., you cannot access your internet service provider), unauthorised access, theft, bodily injury, property damage, operator errors, strikes or other labour problems or any act of god. in connection with Badoo including, without limitation, any liability for loss of revenue or income, loss of profits or contracts, loss of business, loss of anticipated savings, loss of goodwill, loss of data, wasted management or office time and any other loss or damage of any kind, however arising and whether caused by tort (including, but not limited to, negligence), breach of contract or otherwise, even if foreseeable whether arising directly or indirectly.

Badoo’s total liability to you in respect of losses arising under or in connection with the Terms, whether in contract, tort (including negligence, breach of statutory duty, or otherwise) shall in no circumstances exceed £20.

What about the reliability of Badoo and the information contained on it?

Badoo has taken reasonable steps to ensure the currency, availability, correctness and completeness of the information contained on Badoo and provides that information on an "as is", "as available" basis. Badoo does not give or make any warranty or representation of any kind about the information contained on Badoo, whether express or implied. Use of Badoo and the materials available on it is at your sole risk. Badoo cannot be held responsible for any loss arising from the transmission, use of data, or inaccurate Content posted by users. You are responsible for taking all necessary precautions to ensure that any material you may obtain from Badoo is free of viruses or other harmful components. You accept that Badoo will not be provided uninterrupted or error free, that defects may not be corrected or that Badoo, or the server that makes it available, are free of viruses or bugs, spyware, Trojan horses or any similar malicious software. Badoo is not responsible for any damage to your computer hardware, computer software, or other equipment or technology including, but without limitation damage from any security breach or from any virus, bugs, tampering, fraud, error, omission, interruption, defect, delay in operation or transmission, computer line or network failure or any other technical or other malfunction. In the unlikely event that any defect is discovered within Badoo, we will use every effort to repair or fix the defect free of charge, without significant inconvenience to you, as soon as practicable.

10\. Indemnity
--------------

### I forgot the rules about conduct on here and now someone is threatening to sue YOU. What now?

If we are sued as a result of your use of Badoo then we have the right to defend or settle the relevant claim as we see fit. If we ask, you will co-operate fully and reasonably as required by us in the defence of any relevant claim.

You agree to hold harmless and indemnify us and our officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives and licensors from and against any third party claims, damages (actual and/or consequential), actions, proceedings, demands, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable solicitors’ fees) suffered or reasonably incurred by us arising as a result of, or in connection with, your access to and use of Badoo, the uploading or submission of Content to Badoo by you or your conduct, other than in accordance with the Terms or any applicable law or regulation (“**Claim**”). Badoo retains the exclusive right to settle, compromise and pay any and all Claims or causes of action which are brought against us without your prior consent.

11\. Beta Programs
------------------

You may be invited to participate in a beta program. Participation in a beta program is optional and at your own risk. Badoo’s Terms and Conditions and [Privacy Policy (opens in new window)](https://badoo.com/en/privacy/) continue to apply to any beta program. Additional terms may apply. Badoo reserves the right to remove you from a beta program at any time and may suspend or discontinue a beta program at any time without notice to you.

In order to participate in Badoo’s beta program with Apple TestFlight, you will be required to install the Apple TestFlight app and agree to its [Terms of Service (opens in new window)](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/testflight/sren/terms.html) and [Privacy Notice (opens in new window)](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/test-flight/). Only one version of Badoo (the regular App Store version or the TestFlight version) can be installed on your device at a time. If you have the App Store version installed on your device and you install the TestFlight version, your app data may be corrupted or lost and may not be recoverable. You should back up your information before installing the beta app. You may discontinue participating in the beta program at any time by following the instructions in the TestFlight Terms of Service. Discontinuing your participation in the beta program does not delete your Badoo account. You will be able to continue using the regular App Store version of Badoo by reinstalling it and logging into your account. Please note that your data may not remain available from within the App Store version. We recommend that you backup your data before deleting the beta app or reinstalling the full version from the App Store. In-app purchases made whilst participating in a beta program via Apple TestFlight are free, however, subscriptions and consumables (including credits) obtained during the beta program have accelerated expiration rates and will expire within a certain number of minutes after selection. Subscriptions will automatically renew a limited number of times. Apple and/or Badoo may change the expiry periods and renewal rates at their discretion. Subscriptions and consumables obtained during the beta program will not carry over to the App Store version of Badoo unless that version is accessed within the time period during which they are live. Separately, participants may receive a certain number of credits daily for participating in the beta program; those credits will not have accelerated expiry rates, however, they will not carry over to the App Store version of Badoo and Badoo may expire those credits at any time.

### What about all of those standard clauses that you see at the end of most contracts? They’re the best bit!
