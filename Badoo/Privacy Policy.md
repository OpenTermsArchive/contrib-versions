Privacy Policy
==============

Who we are
----------

Badoo is operated by Badoo Trading Limited, a company registered in England at The Broadgate Tower Third Floor, 20 Primrose Street, London, United Kingdom, EC2A 2RS and company number 07540255.

Badoo has designated a Data Protection Officer and they can be reached by emailing DPO@corp.badoo.com or by post at the address above.

What information does Badoo process?
------------------------------------

Badoo is a meeting place for adults, and we provide that service by operating a social network site offering users the opportunity to connect to our global community of users. By joining Badoo, you enter a legal agreement with us and we process your data in order to provide your service under the terms of that agreement. You can only become a member of Badoo or use its features if you’re aged 18 or over or the age of majority in the country in which you reside if that happens to be greater than 18.

To join the Badoo network you will have to complete our online registration form, where we may ask you to provide us with information about you such as your name, your email address, your gender, your date of birth, your location details. You also have the opportunity to provide other details about yourself, but these are optional. Because you control your user profile, these details are available to you at any time by accessing your “Profile” page, which gives you the chance to correct or update (other than your email address and gender) your information at any time by just logging in to Badoo. You can contact Badoo's Customer Support Team at [Feedback Page](http://badoo.com/feedback) to change the gender on your profile and/or email address.

Please be careful about posting sensitive details about yourself on your Profile such as your religious denomination and health details. While you may voluntarily provide this information to us when you create your Profile, including your sexual preferences and ethnic background, there is no requirement to do so. Please remember that photographs or any video clips that you post on Badoo may reveal these kinds of sensitive personal data. Where you do upload and choose to tell us sensitive data about yourself, you are explicitly consenting to our processing your information and making this public to other users.

For safety and security and to ensure you have the best possible user experience, we require users to verify their accounts and might ask for your phone number. We want to make sure you are not a robot! And we also want to avoid fake Badoo accounts being created which can be used for malicious activities and cyber crime – they threaten the Badoo network and spoil things for everyone. We use a third party provider for account verification who will keep your phone number for up to 90 days for fraud identification purposes. We collect and use your phone number on the basis of our legitimate interests identified above and for the prevention of fraud.

It is your responsibility to ensure that your account details are kept up to date. If your phone number changes, please ensure that you update this in your account.

To prevent abuse of the app/site, Badoo uses automated decisions and moderators to block accounts as part of its moderation procedures. In order to do this, we check accounts and messages for content that indicates breaches of our Terms and Conditions of Use. This is done through a combination of automated systems and our team of moderators. If an account or message meets certain criteria that demonstrate that the Terms and Conditions of Use are likely to have been breached, the relevant account will automatically be blocked. All users of accounts that have been blocked will be notified that their account has been blocked and affected users can contact Badoo to contest the decision.

Badoo also uses automated decisions to prevent fraudulent payment transactions being processed as part of its anti-fraud procedures. In order to do this, our systems check payment transactions for behaviour that indicates breaches of our Terms and Conditions of Use. If a transaction meets certain criteria that demonstrate that the Terms and Conditions of Use are likely to have been breached and the transaction is likely to be fraudulent, the relevant transaction may automatically be blocked. Where a transaction is blocked, the user will be notified that their transaction cannot be processed and affected users can contact Badoo to contest the decision.

Please note that if your account is blocked, any account(s) that you have on our other group platforms/applications may also be blocked as part of our anti-spam and anti-fraud procedures.

Our other group platforms/applications are listed here: [https://magiclab.co/brands](https://magiclab.co/brands).

If you decide to purchase any of our premium services, we will process your payment information and retain this securely for the prevention of fraud and for audit/tax purposes. Under data protection law, it is necessary for us to collect and process this payment data to enable us to perform our contract with you and our ongoing retention of this data is justified by our legitimate interests set out above.

To enable Badoo to provide a free non-premium service, we process some limited data (demographics and location) to drive targeted advertising in our legitimate interest including sharing such data with advertising networks. We may also receive data indirectly from such advertising networks. You can stop this within Settings but you will still see adverts though they will be less relevant to you. Through your device’s security settings you also have the option to prevent or limit device identifiers being shared with third party advertisers and what use is made of the device identifiers. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please visit [this page](http://networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

If you consent, we will process information about the apps installed on your device (Android only). We will not process this data without your consent, and you can opt out of this processing within Settings at any time. This data will be used to build a more accurate profile of you, which helps us with matches and to personalise the service even more for you. If you do not opt in to this processing, you will still receive the services, but the matches and service will be less personalised to you.

Finally, we want to keep in touch with you to make sure you know about the great promotions and offers we have available. If you’ve told us it’s OK, we will use your email address and phone number to send you information on these. You can withdraw this consent at any time via Settings in the app or website.

What does Badoo collect about me if I use the mobile App?
---------------------------------------------------------

Badoo offers you the opportunity to stay in touch with the friends and contacts you’ve made no matter where you are. You can do this by using your mobile phone or by downloading an application to your desktop that allows you to share your location with other users.

When you use your mobile or the desktop application, we will collect information about WiFi access points as well as other location information about your longitude and latitude. That information helps us identify your physical location so that it can be displayed and shared with other members choosing to view “nearby” posts.

If you have given Badoo access to your location services, but wish to turn them off, you can do so by the following methods:

1.  iPhone app — settings, privacy, location services, Badoo
2.  Android — settings, location, Badoo, permissions, location

We, or our third-party advertising partners, may also collect and use your device identifier to serve relevant ads to you through the App. You can opt out of targeted advertising by (i) becoming a payer and/ or (ii) opting not to share data with any partner platforms but still to receive advertisements.

If you log into or access Badoo through your Facebook profile, we may collect data including your email address, name and profile picture, date of birth, a list of your friends who also use the app, pages you have liked, location and photos in order to create and update your Badoo profile. You may also appear on your friends’ Facebook apps as a Badoo user.

If you log into or access Badoo through your Facebook profile, remember to log off Facebook when you leave a device in order to prevent other users from accessing your account.

For users who are California residents, the data we may collect falls within the following categories of “personal information,” as defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA):

*   A. Identifiers, such as name and location;
*   B. Personal information, as defined in the California customer records law, such as contact (including email and telephone number) and financial information;
*   C. Characteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law (if you choose to provide them), such as age, gender identity, marital status, sexual orientation, race, ancestry, national origin, religion, and medical conditions;
*   D. Commercial information, such as transaction information and purchase history;
*   E. Biometric information, such as faceprint;
*   F. Internet or network activity information, such as browsing history and interactions with our websites and apps;
*   G. Geolocation data, such as mobile device location;
*   H. Audio, electronic, visual and similar information, such as photos and videos;
*   I. Professional or employment-related information, such as work history and prior employer;
*   J. Non-public education information; and
*   K. Inferences drawn from any of the personal information listed above to create a profile or summary about, for example, an individual’s preferences and characteristics.

How long will Badoo keep my data?
---------------------------------

We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes (as set out above) and as permitted by applicable law.

In practice, we delete or anonymise your information upon deletion of your account (following the safety retention window), unless:

1.  we must keep it to comply with applicable law (for instance, some “traffic data” is kept for one year to comply with statutory data retention obligations);
2.  we must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law (for instance, records of consents to our Terms, Privacy Policy and other similar consents are kept for five years);
3.  there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant information until it is resolved; or
4.  the information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention and enhancing users' safety and security. For example, information may need to be kept to prevent a user who was banned for unsafe behaviour or security incidents from opening a new account.

Where Badoo uses machine learning, for example, to help us detect and prevent fraudulent card transactions, and to detect and prevent spam communications on the App, and to provide a more personalised service(as explained above), we may need to keep personal information for a longer period than the retention periods explained above, to enable the machine learning to work properly. Where this is the case, we always seek to minimise the amount of personal information that is used and we ensure that it is ring-fenced and kept securely from other user personal information. We regularly review the period for which personal information is required for machine learning purposes and delete any identifiable information when it is no longer required.

What information does Badoo collect about me if I’m under 18?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Badoo does not knowingly collect any information about or market to children, minors or anyone under the age of majority. If we become aware that a child, minor or anyone under the age of 18 has registered with us and provided us with personal data, we will take steps to terminate that person’s registration and delete their Profile information from Badoo. If we do delete a Profile because you violated our no children rules, we may retain your email and IP address to ensure that you do not try to get around our rules by creating a new Profile.

Who does Badoo share information with?
--------------------------------------

We may share aggregated information with such parties as Foursquare that includes your personal data (but which doesn’t identify you directly), together with other information including log data with third parties for industry analysis and demographic profiling and to deliver targeted advertising about other products and services.

We share your data with the following categories of third-parties:

| Payment processing and telecommunications companies to facilitate payments for our premium services | Cardholder name, cardholder address, card number, payment amount, transaction date/time (CCPA Categories A, B, and D) |
| In the event that Badoo or any of its affiliates undergoes a business transition or change of ownership, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, re-organisation, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, or in the event of insolvency or administration, we may be required to disclose your personal data to a purchaser of all or part of the business or to an insolvency practitioner | This could include all personal data that Badoo holds about you, including all CCPA Categories listed above |
| Your data may be shared with other Badoo group companies, for example, to block accounts and suspected fraudulent payment transactions as part of our anti-spam and anti- fraud procedures. | This could include CCPA Categories A, B, D and F. |

We ensure these parties must adhere to strict data protection and confidentiality provisions that are consistent with this Policy. Measures are taken to ensure that the data shared is non-attributable to the greatest extent possible.
