Limitation of Liability
-----------------------

The website CCM.net is an informative website on new media technology, and in particular on subjects related to information technology.

Information distributed on the website CCM.net comes from purportedly reliable sources. Nevertheless, **CCM BENCHMARK GROUP** cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of this data. Furthermore, information is provided on this website for information purposes only, and may not be construed as advice or recommendations of any nature whatsoever.

Consequently, the Use of information and content available throughout the site shall not incur any liability whatsoever to CCM BENCHMARK GROUP. The User alone is responsible for the proper and judicious use of the information provided on the Site.

Additionally, the User agrees to hold harmless and indemnify CCM BENCHMARK GROUP for any damages that may result, directly or indirectly, from using the Service.

Access to certain areas of the CCM.net website requires a User Name and Password. The Password, chosen by the User, is personal and private. The User agrees to keep his or her password secret and not to divulge it in any way whatsoever. The use of his or her User Name and his or her Password on the Internet is done at the User's own risk. It is the User's responsibility to take all measures needed to protect his or her own data from any disclosure.

CCM BENCHMARK GROUP, however, agrees to implement all means necessary to guarantee the security and privacy of data transmitted. The User is aware that one or more cookies, containing no personal information, may be placed on his or her hard drive in order to facilitate the login and identification process.

The User is aware of the limitations and restrictions of the Internet, and recognises that it is impossible to guarantee total security when transferring data.

The User agrees to comply with all regulations provided for by French law.

Hyperlinks
----------

Force majeure
-------------

**CCM BENCHMARK GROUP** shall not be held liable in the event of force majeure or any events outside its control.

Modifications to this Contract
