Cookie Policy
-------------

### About Cookies

A cookie is a small text file that websites send to a user’s terminal (computer, tablet, cell phone, or any other device optimized for internet use) when you consult a web page or online publication. It allows websites to personalize themselves according to your profile, which contains collected data such as (depending on the case) your name, your email address, the time and date of connection, the operating system of your computer, frequented sites…  

### Purpose of Cookies

Four types of cookies, each explained below, may therefore be saved to your device during a visit to our websites:  

#### Technical Cookies

Technical Cookies are necessary for the navigation of our website, and allow access to different products and services. Technical Cookies allow us to recognize you, to signal your visit to a particular page, and to improve your browsing experience: to adapt the site’s presentation to your terminal’s display preferences (language, display resolution), and to memorize passwords and other information relative to a form that you filled out on the site (registration or access to the Member Space). Technical Cookies also permit us to implement safety measures (for example, when you are asked to login to the Member Space again after a certain amount of time). We remind you that the deletion of Technical Cookies may impair your access to the site and/or to the services offered.  

#### Analytical Cookies

Analytical Cookies are issued by our technical service providers in order to measure the audience of different content sections of our site so that we may evaluate and better organize them. These cookies also allow, if necessary, to detect navigation problems, and therefore to improve the usability of services. These cookies only produce anonymous statistics and traffic volumes, and exclude all individual information.  

#### Advertising Cookies

Advertising Cookies are issued by our partners in the advertising spaces of our sites. The exploitation of these spaces contributes to the financing of content and services that we place at your disposition. These cookies are deposited by our partners as part of our advertising partnership under which the company may collect data about the content consulted on our site. First and foremost, these cookies permit to count the total number of advertisements seen on our public sites, to identify these advertisements, and to count the number of users who click on each advertisement. If necessary, these cookies also allow us to follow subsequent actions performed by users on these pages to which these advertisements lead in order to calculate the sum due to the advertising broadcast channel (communication agency, advertising agency, site/broadcast medium), and to compile statistics.  
  
These Advertising Cookies also permit us to adapt advertising content displayed on your terminal in our advertising spaces, according to your navigation on our site and, as appropriate, depending on location data (longitude and latitude) transmitted by your terminal with your prior consent. These cookies may ultimately allow us to tailor advertising content displayed on your terminal in our advertising space based on the personal data that you have voluntarily provided (targeted advertising).  

#### Social Media Cookies

Social Media Cookies permit us to share content of our sites with other people, or to inform others of your inquiry or your opinion concerning content on one of our sites. This is notably in the case of the « Share », and « Like » buttons on Facebook or Twitter.  
  
The social network application is provided with a switch with which it is likely to identify you, even if you may not have used it when viewing our site. This type of application button may allow the social network to follow your navigation to our site, just because the social network is active on your terminal (open session) during your visit to our site. We do not have any control over this process used by social networks to collect information about your browsing on our site and to associate this information with other personal data that they may have.  
  
We invite you to review the privacy policies of these social networks in order to familiarize yourself with the use of these cookies, including any advertising and navigation information that they may gather through these application switches.  
  
These protection policies allow you to exercise your rights over these social networks, particularly in configuring your accounts to use each of these social networks.  

Your choices and rights of opposition and deletion of cookies on our sites
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In using our site, you agree to the use of the aforementioned cookies. However, you may at any time choose to deactivate them in your browser. Your browser may also be configured to signal you systematically when cookies are deposited into your device, and ask you to accept them or not.  
  
If your device is used by several people and/or uses multiple browsers, we cannot ensure with certainty that services and advertisements will correspond to your use of this terminal and not those of another user.  
  
In this case, the sharing of your computer and your browser settings with others are your responsibility and your choice.

### Refusing an Advertising Cookie

You may manage the use and exploitation of cookies by visiting the Advertising Cookies management platform proposed by advertising professionals: [https://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices](https://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices) and by following the instructions given. The companies listed on this platform offer you the possibility to refuse or accept cookies used by them to adapt advertisements according to your browsing information.
