Technical Cookies also permit us to implement safety measures (for example, when you are asked to login to the Member Space again after a certain amount of time). We remind you that the deletion of Technical Cookies may impair your access to the site and/or to the services offered.  

#### Analytical Cookies

Analytical Cookies are issued by our technical service providers in order to measure the audience of different content sections of our site so that we may evaluate and better organize them.

These cookies only produce anonymous statistics and traffic volumes, and exclude all individual information.  

#### Advertising Cookies

Advertising Cookies are issued by our partners in the advertising spaces of our sites. The exploitation of these spaces contributes to the financing of content and services that we place at your disposition.

If necessary, these cookies also allow us to follow subsequent actions performed by users on these pages to which these advertisements lead in order to calculate the sum due to the advertising broadcast channel (communication agency, advertising agency, site/broadcast medium), and to compile statistics.  
  
These Advertising Cookies also permit us to adapt advertising content displayed on your terminal in our advertising spaces, according to your navigation on our site and, as appropriate, depending on location data (longitude and latitude) transmitted by your terminal with your prior consent.

We do not have any control over this process used by social networks to collect information about your browsing on our site and to associate this information with other personal data that they may have.
