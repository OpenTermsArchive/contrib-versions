### About Cookies

A cookie is a small text file that websites send to a user’s terminal (computer, tablet, cell phone, or any other device optimized for internet use) when you consult a web page or online publication. It allows websites to personalize themselves according to your profile, which contains collected data such as (depending on the case) your name, your email address, the time and date of connection, the operating system of your computer, frequented sites…

#### Analytical Cookies

Analytical Cookies are issued by our technical service providers in order to measure the audience of different content sections of our site so that we may evaluate and better organize them. These cookies also allow, if necessary, to detect navigation problems, and therefore to improve the usability of services. These cookies only produce anonymous statistics and traffic volumes, and exclude all individual information.

#### Advertising Cookies

Advertising Cookies are issued by our partners in the advertising spaces of our sites.
