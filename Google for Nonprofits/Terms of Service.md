=================================================

Last modified: 7 February 2020

 

To request a Google for Nonprofits account, you must accept (1) [the Google Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en-US), and (2) these Google for Nonprofits Additional Terms of Service (the '**Google for Nonprofits Additional Terms**') on behalf of yourself and your organisation. 

 

Please read each of these documents carefully. Together, these documents are known as the '**Terms**'. They establish what you can expect from us as you use our services, and what we expect from you.

 

If these Google for Nonprofits Additional Terms conflict with [the Google Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en-US), these Google for Nonprofits Additional Terms will govern for the Google for Nonprofits programme. 

 

Although it’s not a part of these Terms, we encourage you to read [our Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US) to better understand how you can [update, manage, export and delete your information](http://account.google.com/).

 

You represent that you are 18 years of age or older and capable of entering into a legally binding agreement. The Terms are effective as of the day that you click on the 'Submit' button.  If you don’t have the legal authority to bind your organisation, do not click the 'Submit' button.

1\. Activation and Terms for G4NP-offered products 

1.1 The Terms govern you and your organisation’s application and use of the Google for Nonprofits platform and programme ('G4NP Programme'). Acceptance into the G4NP Programme does not necessarily enable you or your organisation to use the Google products offered through the G4NP Programme without taking additional steps to activate products, including agreeing to separate product-specific Terms of Service. 

2\. Your Warranties

2.1 You represent and warrant that:

2.1.1 The information submitted in your organisation’s Google for Nonprofits request is true and correct.

2.1.2 Your organisation does not discriminate against any person or group of people in either hiring/employment practices or in the administration of programmes and services, including on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.

2.1.3 Your organisation may use the G4NP Programme under its own policies and applicable laws and regulations, and your organisation’s use of the G4NP Programme will not negatively impact Google's current or future ability to do business with your organisation.

2.1.4 You and your organisation will comply with all applicable laws, including all applicable export laws and trade sanctions programmes, and all anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, in connection with its use of the G4NP Programme, and the G4NP Programme will not be used to (i) corruptly influence any government official to obtain or retain business or any improper advantage, (ii) gain or retain business, (iii) cause a government official to do or not do something in their official capacity or (iv) to gain any other improper advantage. 

3\. Designation of Account Administrator and Privacy

3.1 If your organisation’s application is approved, you will become an administrator for your organisation’s G4NP Programme account. If you approve other users to be administrators of your organisation’s account, they will have the same rights as you to control your organisation’s account, including the ability to remove you as an administrator.

3.2 You consent to other administrators for your organisation’s account seeing your name and the details of your administrative actions, including, removal of administrators, rejection of users applying to be administrators and applications for Google for Nonprofits products.
