Hello. Nice to see you here.

When you browse the web, you leave a digital footprint. It’s information about your device and the way you use it online.

We just want to let you know that we’ll collect this information about you. Most websites do this.

We use this information to deliver the website to you. We also use it for other things, which we think help you and us.

We’ve put this notice together to explain this. Don’t worry. It takes a little over 7 minutes to read.

By the way, when we say “we” this means the HSBC group of companies and our trusted partners who provide services to us.

These include our:

*   Technology providers
*   Cybersecurity companies
*   Social media partners
*   Advertising partners

The data controller for this website and for the processing activities carried out on this website is HSBC Holdings plc. We’ve set out contact details at the end of this notice if you need to reach us.

Our privacy notices
-------------------

This is our website notice.

We have other notices. Some of these may apply to you as well. It depends on how you choose to interact with us.

*   Public website notice (you are here): this notice covers parts of this website where you don’t need a password (like this page)
*   Full privacy notice: our full privacy notices contain more information to read alongside this notice. These notices are country/territory-specific and will tell you more details, such as the full company names of HSBC’s data controllers in those countries and territories, and the products and services they cover. They also tell you how HSBC uses your personal information in general for those products and services and in those countries and territories. You can read them by visiting the website for the relevant product or service, or you can contact your customer services team for a copy. A list of these websites can be found on our [Contact us page](https://www.hsbc.com/contact-us)
*   Cookie notice: this notice covers how we collect information from your web browser or mobile device
*   Other notices: some of our apps or parts of our websites have their own privacy notices. For example, our mobile apps have privacy notices. So does our careers section of our website at hsbc.com/careers. You can usually find our notices in the footer of the webpage. If you’re using an app, it will usually be in the menu. Our full privacy notice is our main one and can be found by visiting the website for the product or services we provide you. A list of these websites can be found on our [Contact us page](https://www.hsbc.com/contact-us)

Personal information collected by this website
----------------------------------------------

We collect information when you use our website. We also do this when you visit one of our social media sites.

When you view our website or social media sites, we can see:

*   What you click
*   What you view
*   How long you spend on pages
*   Your device and internet connection details such as: type of device you’re using, IP address and details about your internet connection, technical details such as your screen size and the software you’re using, such as your web browser
*   Your country or region (not exactly where you are unless we ask permission)
*   Your unique advertising or other identification numbers allocated to your browser or device

If you follow a link to this website, we know the last site you visited. You may have reached this website by following a link from an e-mail. When you open an email from us, we may be able to tell:

*   That you’ve opened it
*   What links in the email you click on

When you fill in a form on our website, we can see what you type.

If you send us a message or complete a form, we may collect information you tell us.

Some of this data is collected by:

*   **Our partners:** these may be website hosts or social media sites
*   **Cyber-security filtering technology:** this keeps our website safe from fraud and crime
*   **Cookies and similar technology:** these are set on your device by us and our trusted partners

We don’t often know exactly who you are from this data. But sometimes we may connect this data with other information we hold about you.

For example:

*   If you browse our website and then access online banking, we may connect this data to you. The next time you visit, we may still link that data to you
*   If you browse our website while logged into social media accounts, then our partners may be able to connect this data to those accounts

It might be possible to connect your browsing data to personal data held by third parties.

We use your data when it is in our legitimate interests.

This means we need to have a valid and lawful reason to use your data and balance this with your interests.

### Facebook

When you use an HSBC Page on Facebook, Facebook Ireland and HSBC collect information about you. This includes:

*   What you click on: if you start a messenger conversation
*   What you view: when you hover over a link or have an event page on screen
*   What you say: like comments or reactions
*   Your actions: like sharing or recommending
*   Your activity: how long you spend on pages, date and time of actions or websites you visited before you took the action

*   Your Facebook profile details and user ID

HSBC has access to this information to use for reporting, insights and marketing purposes and so does Facebook.

This helps HSBC improve our offering on Facebook and create better marketing. HSBC may also see this information if HSBC has communicated with you on Facebook. HSBC does this because it helps us know who we’re speaking to.

If you’ve allowed us to use cookies that support our marketing, HSBC and Facebook can collect this information when you use HSBC’s site too. To learn more, or to switch this off, please visit our Cookie notice at [https://www.hsbc.com/cookie-notice](https://www.hsbc.com/cookie-notice). You can control which cookies you allow by selecting “Manage Cookies”.

We and Facebook have agreed to share some responsibilities to protect your personal data, by:

*   Making sure we each have a legal basis for joint processing
