The Site is an information source and it is a gateway to the website of your local HSBC company or to other HSBC companies. You cannot purchase products or services from hsbc.com directly. If you want to know about any of the products and services described on the Site, we ask you to visit the appropriate Local Site under the relevant country you live in. You will then be directed to a Local Site. Some of the products and services described on hsbc.com may not be available from your Local Site.

The provision of financial services or products

Not all the products and services that you may be able to view via the Site are available in all geographical locations or available to all customers. The relevant HSBC Group member reserves the right to make the final determination on whether or not you are eligible for any particular product or service. If you choose to enter a website outside your country of residence, you are advised that it may not be legal in that jurisdiction for you to access or use the facilities available on that Site and the legal requirements of that jurisdiction may prohibit you from dealing or otherwise transacting in that jurisdiction.
