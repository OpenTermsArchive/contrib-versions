The provision of financial services or products

Not all the products and services that you may be able to view via the Site are available in all geographical locations or available to all customers. The relevant HSBC Group member reserves the right to make the final determination on whether or not you are eligible for any particular product or service. If you choose to enter a website outside your country of residence, you are advised that it may not be legal in that jurisdiction for you to access or use the facilities available on that Site and the legal requirements of that jurisdiction may prohibit you from dealing or otherwise transacting in that jurisdiction.
