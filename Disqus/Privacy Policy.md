However, if you make comments using the Service that include such data about yourself it will be publicly available and may be processed by Disqus or others. Additionally, we collect and share information collected through cookies or similar tracking technology about the web pages you have viewed, which may allow the third-parties with whom we share your information to make inferences about you that could constitute sensitive personal information.

We may also combine, de-identify, or aggregate any of the information we collect through our Service for any of the purposes described below.

#### **3\. HOW IS YOUR PERSONAL DATA COLLECTED?**

We use different methods to collect data from and about you including via:

**Direct interactions**. This includes personal data you provide when you create an account or leave a comment.

**Automated technologies or interactions**. As you interact with our Service, we may automatically collect Technical Data about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns. Specifically, in the following ways:

**Cookies**. A cookie is a small digital file placed on the hard drive of your computer. You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating settings on your browser, or, in some cases, by interacting with pop-up cookie banners. We use cookies placed on third party websites on which the Service is enabled to collect information about how you interact with those websites even if you do not leave comments, respond to polls, or otherwise directly interact with the Service on those websites, as well as information about the other websites that you visit. Disqus uses cookies and allows partners to also set cookies through the Service in order to facilitate cross-context behavioral advertising. What this means in practice is that we use cookies to help determine which ads you see online, by logging your visits to many advertiser / brand websites, and then showing you ads for similar products and services.

Disqus uses 'authentication' cookies, e.g., sessionid, disqusauth, and disqusauths, to keep you logged in from your web browser and personalize your Disqus experience.

Disqus uses 'unique' cookies, e.g., disqus\_unique and \_jid, to associate web-based activities with a page load and with a web browser, and understand your interests and product usage.

When Disqus loads ads, we use ad serving technologies from [Google](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads) that may set cookies for the purposes of personalized marketing, associating ads with later activities, and limiting how often you are shown specific ads.

**Log File Information**: Server logs collect technical data such as your IP address, browser type, and information about the number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, partner sites, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.

**Pixels and Similar Trackers.** When you use the Service, we employ pixels, clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to collect Technical Data and information such as online usage patterns. We also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links or advertisements are clicked by recipients. We also use pixels and clear gifs on third party websites on which the Service is enabled to collect information about how you interact with those websites, even if you do not leave comments, respond to polls, or otherwise directly interact with the Service on those websites.

**Third parties or publicly available sources**. We obtain or receive personal data about you from analytics providers such as Google; advertising partners listed [here](https://help.disqus.com/terms-and-policies/third-party-advertising-partners); and third-party data brokers who sell personal data. We obtain or receive personal data from third party connections or log-ins through social media platforms such as Facebook Connect, Google or Twitter/X when you “follow,” “like,” or link your account to the Service. Please note that some of these providers, in particular analytics providers like Google, may process data from European Economic Area (EEA) residents outside the EEA.

Managing Cookies in Your Browser

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but the functionality of some areas may be limited.

#### **4\. TARGETED ADVERTISING and AD PARTNERS.**

In the past 12 months, we have sold and/or shared all of the categories of personal data listed above with Zeta Global and our Business Partners (as described below).

**Zeta Global**. Disqus user data is shared with our affiliated company Zeta Global for marketing purposes, including cross-context behavioral advertising. Disqus data is merged by Zeta with data from other online and offline sources to inform marketing decisions and messages on behalf of Zeta’s advertiser customers (brands and agencies). Zeta may also share data obtained from Disqus with these advertiser customers.

**Business Partners.** We also share personal data with external third parties for similar purposes as with Zeta Global. These third parties include other companies who participate in cross-context behavioral advertising, and data brokers who may further sell or share your personal data. We may also share personal data with advertisers with whom you have already shared your data interest categories based on your online activity, for marketing purposes. For a list of external third parties, please click [here](https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1944034-cookies-and-data-recipients).

**Service Providers.** We rely on service providers (e.g. companies that provide web hosting or analytics services) for the operation of our website and Service, and these service providers may have access to your personal data. Our service providers are contractually prohibited from using your personal data for their own purposes, and are required to treat your personal data and maintain its confidentiality in the same way as us.

**Business Transactions.** We may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new company may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice. We may also engage in limited data sharing to evaluate and test our potential data partners. Where such testing takes place, the data is encrypted or encoded before it is shared. Furthermore, such sharing is subject to appropriate contractual provisions and the data is promptly deleted after the testing is completed.

**Legal Requirements.** In addition, we may access, preserve, and disclose your personal data, if we believe doing so is required by law, court order or other valid legal processes. We may also access, preserve, and disclose such personal data if we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect your, our or others' rights, property, or safety, or to investigate fraud.

We require all third parties with whom we share data to take appropriate steps to ensure the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with all applicable laws.

#### **7\. DATA RETENTION.**

We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

#### **8\. SECURITY.**

Disqus uses commercially reasonable safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all information collected through the Service. To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from Disqus. Disqus is not responsible for the functionality or security measures of any third party.

#### **9\. Your Rights.**

IV. **Request that we delete** data we have collected about you;

V. **Request that we correct** incorrect data;

VI. **Request that we limit our use of, or delete sensitive personal data** that you may have previously provided in a comment (due to technical limitations, all of these requests will be handled as requests to delete data).

Disqus will not discriminate against you for exercising your privacy rights. Prior to fulfilling a request for a copy of your personal information, Disqus is required to reasonably verify your identity, which we generally do by sending a verification link to the email address associated with your personal information. Under applicable laws, you can use an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, but that agent must be able to complete our verification process in order to demonstrate that they have been authorized to make the request.

You also have the right in many countries to contact the relevant privacy or data protection authority if you believe we are not complying with privacy laws, and we have not been able to resolve the situation to your satisfaction.
