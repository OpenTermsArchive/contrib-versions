Privacy Policy

Disqus, Inc. (“Disqus,” “we,” or “us”) provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use, disclosure and protection of information that apply to our Service, as well as your choices regarding the collection and use of information.

Overview

Disqus is a free service that enables great online communities and discussion. We fully support freedom of speech. We give you the options to identify yourself in public online communities, in whatever format you’re comfortable with.

Personally Identifiable Information

To use the Disqus Service, an email address, username and password are required. That’s it. As described further in this Privacy Policy, we use personally identifiable information to deliver the Service, to comply with reasonable requests of law enforcement, and recommend additional content to you, some of which may include content from advertisers. We may share your personally identifiable information with our vendors to perform services for us, and we may share encrypted email addresses, device identifiers or anonymous information with third parties who want to market to or communicate with you about products and services, in each case as described below.

Advertising

Advertising is the primary way Disqus makes money. We are paid by advertisers to serve and share content.

Censorship

Disqus does not moderate comments on the sites that use our Service. If a comment you make is deleted or not posted, it is done so at the discretion of that site operator. Each community using Disqus establishes their own standards for etiquette and acceptable language.

More detailed information on our privacy practices and procedures follows.

Information Collection on the Service

Our Service allows for an interactive experience by integrating a commenting platform. By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a public comment sharing platform and that we or other Users may search for, see, use, re-post any of your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our Terms of Service.

Personally Identifiable Information: We collect information that we use to identify you as an individual (“Personally Identifiable Information”) when you provide such information in connection with the Service. We ask for and retain Personally Identifiable Information such as your name, username, and e-mail address when you register for a Disqus account with the Service, or if you correspond with us (in which case we will also retain our correspondence). We may also retain any comments or replies to comments you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in any other User Content you post to the Service. we treat this information as Personally Identifiable Information only when we store it with the name, username, or e-mail address you provide to register for a Disqus account, and in all other cases we treat it as Non-Personally Identifiable Information. We may receive Personally Identifiable Information about you from third parties, including, for example, information about your transactions, purchase history, or relationships with various product and service providers, and your use of certain applications. For example, if you access our website or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through Facebook Connect, by “following,” “liking,” linking your account to the Disqus service, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to Disqus. This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account, any information you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to Disqus’ website or Service.

Non-Personally Identifiable Information: We also collect and use information about your interactions with the Service, and with websites that use the Service, in a manner and format that does not directly identify you as an individual (“Non-Personally Identifiable Information”).  Non-Personally Identifiable Information also includes information that we collect and use that we make anonymous by obfuscating or removing information that directly identifies you.  In addition, we collect and use comments, replies, and other User Content you post to the Service, and regardless of whether the information that they contain identifies you, we treat this information as Non-Personally Identifiable Information when it is separate from the name, username, or e-mail address you provide to register for a Disqus account. We may collect, use, and disclose anonymous and Non-Personally Identifiable Information for any lawful purpose including but not limited to as set forth below.

Cookies Information: Like many websites, when you visit or use the Service, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets Disqus help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us to track your usage of the Service (including on third party websites that include the Service) over time. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent uses of the Service (or visits to websites that include the Service). Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.

Analytics Information: We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including the web pages you visit, your browser add-ons, your browser’s width and height, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We do not use this analytics information in a form that directly identifies any particular individual user.

Log File Information: Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.

Clear Gifs/Web Beacons Information: When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users without using information that directly identifies them. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information is allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.

Information Collection on Partner Sites

We may receive and collect information from users of third party sites that use the Disqus Service ("Partner Sites").  This information may include information about you and your usage of the Disqus Service on Partner Sites. Unless you have allowed the Partner Site to share Personally Identifiable Information, such information will not include Personally Identifiable Information, but it may include Non-Personally Identifiable Information and/or other information about your usage of the Partner Site and the Disqus Service on that site such as your comments and other User Content, and we may be able to match this information to Personally Identifiable Information that we possess, such as your email address and username.

How We Use and Share Personally Identifiable Information

Use: We use Personally Identifiable Information for the following purposes: (i) internally for purposes such as analyzing how the Service is used, diagnosing service or technical problems or maintaining security, (ii) to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service, (iii) to fulfill requests you may make to us, (iv) to personalize your experience and (v) to provide you with information and offers that we believe you may find useful or interesting, including newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information on services and products offered by us or third parties. Following termination or deactivation of your Disqus account, Disqus may retain your profile information and User Content for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, or audit purposes. Furthermore, Disqus may retain and continue to use indefinitely all information (including User Content) contained in your comments and replies or posted using the Service after termination or deactivation of your Disqus account. Disqus reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor the User Content you post on the Service. We reserve the right to remove any such information or material for any reason or no reason, including without limitation if in our sole opinion such information or material violates, or may violate, any applicable law or our Terms of Service, or to protect or defend our rights or property or those of any third party. Disqus also reserves the right to remove information upon the request of any third party.

Sharing: We may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information collected to unaffiliated third parties as described below:

• Who we may share your Personally Identifiable Information with: We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with unaffiliated third party agents and contractors to provide the Services to you, or to enable such agents and contractors to perform services they are providing for us, such as, but not limited to, host our websites, conduct marketing campaigns, order fulfillment and research and analytics.

• Who we may share your anonymous information with: We may share anonymous information, such as encrypted email addresses or device identifiers, with unaffiliated third-party business partners that intend to market products and services to you directly and otherwise communicate with you about their own products and services. If you do not want us to share your information with other companies or organizations as described in this paragraph, you may opt-out per instructions below.

• Who you may choose to share your User Content with: Any Personally Identifiable Information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User Content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings.

If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other Users have copied or saved that information.

• What happens in the event of a change of control: We may buy or sell/divest the company, or any combination of its products, services, assets and/or businesses. Personally Identifiable Information such as customer names and email addresses, User Content and other user information related to the Service will likely be among the items transferred in these types of transactions. We may also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions or similar transactions or proceedings.

Instances where we are required to share your Personally Identifiable Information: Disqus will disclose Personally Identifiable Information where required to do so by law or subpoena or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement. (b) to enforce our Terms of Service or to protect the security or integrity of our Service. and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Disqus, our Users or others.

Disqus recognizes the following guiding principles for any required sharing of information to third parties: a) freedom of expression and identity choice are core to the Disqus platform and should be respected as such, b) law enforcement requests must comply with all laws, particularly those protecting user information, and must clearly establish the legal need for disclosure, c) law enforcement requests must be related to specific investigations and specific accounts implicated in those investigations, d) whenever legally permitted, and barring exceptional circumstances where safety or other factors are deemed a reasonable counteracting concern, Users should receive notice that their specific information is being requested with opportunity to inquire further or contest such requests.

•   Submitting law enforcement requests: Disqus, Inc. is located in San Francisco, California and will only respond to valid legal process in compliance with U.S. law. All subpoenas must be validly issued through a California or federal court. When requesting user information, official law enforcement authorities should submit the following information by mail to Disqus, Inc., Law Enforcement Requests, 301 Howard St., Suite 300, San Francisco, CA 94105:

*   The display name of the user profile in question.

*   Details about what specific information is requested and its relationship to your investigation. We cannot process overly broad or vague requests.
*   A valid email address so we may get back in touch with you upon receipt of your legal process.

Non-U.S. law enforcement requests: U.S. law authorizes Disqus to respond to requests for user information from foreign law enforcement agencies that are issued via U.S. court either by way of a mutual legal assistance treaty or a letter rogatory. Disqus will respond to such U.S. court ordered requests when properly served.

How We Use and Share Non-Personally Identifiable Information

Use: We may use and disclose Non-Personally Identifiable Information and User Content (which, depending on what you have chosen to include in such User Content, may directly or indirectly identify you) for any number of reasons and with any number of third parties, including without limitation: in order to monitor and analyze use of the Service and for the Service’s technical administration. to diagnose or fix technology problems reported by our Users or engineers that are associated with certain IP addresses. to increase our Service’s functionality and user-friendliness. to better tailor it to your needs. to generate and derive useful data and information concerning the interests, characteristics and website use behavior of our users, including for our or third party advertising purposes. to verify that visitors to and users of the Service meet the criteria required to process their requests. and to automatically update the Disqus application on your system and related devices.

Sharing: We may share Non-Personally Identifiable Information and User Content (which, depending on what you have chosen to include in such User Content, may directly or indirectly identify you), including information obtained through tools such as cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data and clear gifs (such as usage data, comments and replies, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.): (i) in any manner permitted for Personally Identifiable Information. (ii) with our third-party business partners for use in advertising targeting. (iii) for the purposes described in the section above. We may also aggregate or otherwise strip data of all personally identifying characteristics and may share that aggregated, anonymous data with third parties.

Ads on Disqus

We may also share certain information such as your location, browser and cookie data, Non-Personally Identifiable Data, and other data relating to your use of our Service with our business partners to deliver advertisements (“ads”) that may be of interest to you. Disqus may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on the Service. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser or mobile device, the ads and ad links that appear on the Service, and these third parties will automatically receive your IP address when they do so. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, device identifiers, location data, and clear gifs, see above) to compile information about your browser’s or device’s visits and usage patterns on the Service, and to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize the advertising content.

Please note that an advertiser may ask Disqus to show an ad to a certain audience of Users (e.g., based on demographics or other interests). In that situation, Disqus determines the target audience and Disqus serves the advertising to that audience and only provides anonymous aggregated data to the advertiser. If you respond to such an ad, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.

The Disqus Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers or contact such advertisers for more information.

The Service provides a commenting platform and you should be aware that any information which you voluntarily include and transmit in connection with the Service (e.g., online in a blog or otherwise online) may be viewed and used by others.

Security

Disqus is very concerned with safeguarding your information. Disqus uses commercially reasonable safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all information collected through the Service. To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from Disqus, at all times. Notwithstanding the foregoing measures, Disqus cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Disqus or guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed. Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes to the functionality of Disqus’ distributors, such as social networks. Disqus is not responsible for the functionality or security measures of any third party.

If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information to or on Disqus. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
