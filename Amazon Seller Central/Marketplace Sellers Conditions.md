**General Terms**

Welcome to **Amazon Services Business Solutions**, a suite of optional services for sellers including: [Selling on Amazon](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/G6F7CN3EQS7MEGCN), [Fulfillment by Amazon](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/G53921), [Amazon Advertising](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/G200663330), [Transaction Processing Services](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/G202073180), and the [Selling Partner API](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/GGE2PFUPLTR6J8FX).

THIS AMAZON SERVICES BUSINESS SOLUTIONS AGREEMENT (THE **"AGREEMENT"**) CONTAINS THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT GOVERN YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICES AND IS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU OR THE BUSINESS YOU REPRESENT AND AMAZON. BY REGISTERING FOR OR USING THE SERVICES, YOU (ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF OR THE BUSINESS YOU REPRESENT) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE SERVICE TERMS AND PROGRAM POLICIES THAT APPLY FOR EACH COUNTRY FOR WHICH YOU REGISTER OR ELECT TO USE A SERVICE (IN EACH CASE, THE **"ELECTED COUNTRY"**).

As used in this Agreement, **"we," "us,"** and **"Amazon"** means the applicable Amazon Contracting Party and any of its applicable Affiliates, and **"you"** means the applicant (if registering for or using a Service as an individual), or the business employing the applicant (if registering for or using a Service as a business) and any of its Affiliates. Capitalized terms have the meanings given to them in this Agreement. To the extent there is a conflict between these General Terms, the Service Terms and Program Policies, the conflict will be resolved by giving precedence in the order specified in such documents, or if not specified, the following order: the General Terms, the Service Terms, and the Program Policies.

1.   **Enrollment.**

To begin the enrollment process, you must complete the registration process for one or more of the Services. Use of the Services is limited to parties that can lawfully enter into and form contracts under applicable Law (for example, the Elected Country may not allow minors to use the Services). As part of the application, or at any time during the term of this Agreement, you must provide us with your (or your business') legal name, address, phone number and e-mail address, as well as any other information we may request. Any information provided must correspond to your business name or to the name of an individual legally authorized to act on behalf of your business. Any personal data you provide to us will be handled in accordance with Amazon’s [Privacy Notice](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ie=UTF8&nodeId=468496&ref_=footer_privacy).

2.   **Service Fee Payments; Receipt of Sales Proceeds.**

Fee details are described in the applicable Service Terms and Program Policies. You are responsible for all of your expenses in connection with this Agreement. To use a Service, you must provide us with valid credit card information from a credit card or credit cards acceptable by Amazon (**"Your Credit Card"**) as well as valid bank account information for a bank account or bank accounts acceptable by Amazon (conditions for acceptance may be modified or discontinued by us at any time without notice) (**"Your Bank Account"**). You will use only a name you are authorized to use in connection with a Service and will update all of the information you provide to us in connection with the Services as necessary to ensure that it at all times remains accurate, complete, and valid. You authorize us (and will provide us documentation evidencing your authorization upon our request) to verify your information (including any updated information), to obtain credit reports about you from time to time, to obtain credit authorizations from the issuer of Your Credit Card, and to charge Your Credit Card or debit Your Bank Account for any sums payable by you to us (in reimbursement or otherwise). All payments to you will be remitted to Your Bank Account through a banking network or by other means specified by us. Except as provided otherwise, all amounts contemplated in this Agreement will be expressed and displayed in the Local Currency, and all payments contemplated by this Agreement will be made in the Local Currency.

**If we determine that your actions or performance may result in returns, chargebacks, claims, disputes, violations of our terms or policies, violations of law or other risks to Amazon or third parties, then we may in our sole discretion withhold any payments to you for as long as we determine any related risks to Amazon or third parties persist. For any amounts that we determine you owe us, we may (a) charge Your Credit Card or any other payment instrument you provide to us; (b) offset any amounts that are payable by you to us (in reimbursement or otherwise) against any payments we may make to you or amounts we may owe you; (c) invoice you for amounts due to us, in which case you will pay the invoiced amounts upon receipt; (d) reverse any credits to Your Bank Account; or (e) collect payment or reimbursement from you by any other lawful means.** 

****To be eligible for fund disbursement, you must refrain from deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity and remain in compliance with our Program Policies. If we determine that your account—or any other account you have operated—has been used to engage in deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity (including the sale of counterfeit or stolen goods), or your use of the Services has harmed, or our controls identify that it might harm other sellers, customers, or Amazon’s legitimate interests, then we may in our sole discretion permanently withhold any payments to you, because these activities expose Amazon to financial risks and inflict monetary damages and irreparable non-monetary harms on Amazon.** **We will offer you an avenue to appeal our fund withholding decision by following the procedures outlined in Amazon’s policies. Successfully completing the appeal process is required to be eligible for further disbursements.****   

In addition, we may require that you pay other amounts to secure the performance of your obligations under this Agreement or to mitigate the risk of returns, chargebacks, claims, disputes, violations of our terms or policies, or other risks to Amazon or third parties. These amounts may be refundable or nonrefundable in the manner we determine, and failure to comply with terms of this Agreement, including any applicable Program Policies, may result in their forfeiture.

As a security measure, we may, but are not required to, impose transaction limits on some or all customers and sellers relating to the value of any transaction or disbursement, the cumulative value of all transactions or disbursements during a period of time, or the number of transactions per day or other period of time. We will not be liable to you: (i) if we do not proceed with a transaction or disbursement that would exceed any limit established by us for a security reason, or (ii) if we permit a customer to withdraw from a transaction because an Amazon Site or Service is unavailable following the commencement of a transaction.

3.   **Term and Termination.**

The term of this Agreement will start on the date of your completed registration for use of a Service and continue until terminated by us or you as provided below. You may at any time terminate your account or this Agreement immediately on notice to us via Seller Central, email, the Contact Us form, or similar means. We may terminate your account or this Agreement for convenience with 30 days’ advance notice. We may suspend or terminate your account or this Agreement immediately if we determine that (a) you have materially breached the Agreement and failed to cure within 7 days of a cure notice unless your breach exposes us to liability toward a third party, in which case we are entitled to reduce, or waive, the aforementioned cure period at our reasonable discretion; (b) your account has been, or our controls identify that it may be used for deceptive or fraudulent, or illegal activity; (c) your use of the Services has harmed, or our controls identify that it might harm, other sellers, customers, or Amazon’s legitimate interests; (d) your [Account Health Rating](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/G200205250) falls below our published threshold(s) for deactivation; or (e) if we are required to do so by law. We will promptly notify you of any such termination or suspension via email or similar means including Seller Central, indicating the reason and any options to appeal, except where we have reason to believe that providing this information will hinder the investigation or prevention of deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or will enable you to circumvent our safeguards. On termination of this Agreement, all related rights and obligations under this Agreement immediately terminate, except that (f) you will remain responsible for performing all of your obligations in connection with transactions entered into before termination and for any liabilities that accrued before or as a result of termination, and (g) Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15, and 18 of these General Terms and Section P-4 of the Transaction Processing Service Terms survive and the Fulfillment by Amazon Service Terms survive as set forth in Section F-13 of such terms.

4.   **License.**

You grant us a royalty-free, non-exclusive, worldwide right and license for the duration of your original and derivative intellectual property rights to use any and all of Your Materials for the Services or other Amazon product or service, and to sublicense the foregoing rights to our Affiliates and operators of Amazon Associated Properties; provided, however, that we will not alter any of Your Trademarks from the form provided by you (except to re-size trademarks to the extent necessary for presentation, so long as the relative proportions of such trademarks remain the same) and will comply with your removal requests as to specific uses of Your Materials (provided you are unable to do so using standard functionality made available to you via the applicable Amazon Site or Service); provided further, however, that nothing in this Agreement will prevent or impair our right to use Your Materials without your consent to the extent that such use is allowable without a license from you or your Affiliates under applicable Law (e.g., fair use under United States copyright law, referential use under trademark law, or valid license from a third party).

5.   **Representations.**

Each party represents and warrants that: (a) if it is a business, it is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the country in which the business is registered and that you are registering for the Service(s) within such country; (b) it has all requisite right, power, and authority to enter into this Agreement, perform its obligations, and grant the rights, licenses, and authorizations in this Agreement; (c) any information provided or made available by one party to the other party or its Affiliates is at all times accurate, complete, and not misappropriated; (d) it is not subject to sanctions or otherwise designated on any list of prohibited or restricted parties or owned or controlled by such a party, including but not limited to the lists maintained by the United Nations Security Council, the US Government (e.g., the US Department of Treasury’s Specially Designated Nationals list and Foreign Sanctions Evaders list and the US Department of Commerce’s Entity List), the European Union or its member states, or other applicable government authority; and (e) it will comply with all applicable Laws in performance of its obligations and exercise of its rights under this Agreement.

6.   **Indemnification.**

**6.1 Your indemnification obligations**. You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Amazon, and our officers, directors, employees, and agents, against any third-party claim, loss, damage, settlement, cost, expense, or other liability (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees) (each, a “Claim”) arising from or related to (a) your non-compliance with applicable Laws; (b) Your Products, including the offer, sale, fulfillment (except to the extent attributable to the FBA service), refund, cancellation, return, or adjustments thereof, Your Materials, any actual or alleged infringement of any Intellectual Property Rights by any of the foregoing, and any personal injury, death (to the extent the injury or death is not caused by Amazon), or property damage related thereto; (c) Your Taxes and duties or the collection, payment, or failure to collect or pay Your Taxes or duties, or the failure to meet tax registration obligations or duties; or (d) actual or alleged breach of any representations you have made.

**6.2 Amazon’s indemnification obligations**. Amazon will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless you and your officers, directors, employees, and agents against any third-party Claim arising from or related to: (a) Amazon’s non-compliance with applicable Laws; or (b) allegations that the operation of an Amazon Site infringes or misappropriates that third party’s intellectual property rights.

**6.3 Process**. If any indemnified Claim might adversely affect us, we may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, voluntarily intervene in the proceedings at our expense. No party may consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement of an indemnified Claim without the prior written consent of the other party, which may not be unreasonably withheld; except that a party may settle any claim that is exclusively directed at and exclusively affects that party.

7.   **Disclaimer & General Release.**

**a.** THE AMAZON SITES AND THE SERVICES, INCLUDING ALL CONTENT, SOFTWARE, FUNCTIONS, MATERIALS, AND INFORMATION MADE AVAILABLE ON OR PROVIDED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES, ARE PROVIDED "AS-IS." AS A USER OF THE SERVICES, YOU USE THE AMAZON SITES, THE SERVICES, AND SELLER CENTRAL AT YOUR OWN RISK. EXCEPT THOSE SET FORTH IN SECTION 5 ABOVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, WE AND OUR AFFILIATES DISCLAIM: (i) ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES REGARDING THIS AGREEMENT, THE SERVICES OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT; (ii) IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, OR USAGE OF TRADE; AND (iii) ANY OBLIGATION, LIABILITY, RIGHT, CLAIM, OR REMEDY IN TORT, WHETHER OR NOT ARISING FROM OUR NEGLIGENCE. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE AMAZON SITES AND THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR BE AVAILABLE, TIMELY, SECURE, UNINTERRUPTED, OR ERROR FREE, AND WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO SYSTEM FAILURES OR OTHER INTERRUPTIONS THAT MAY AFFECT THE RECEIPT, PROCESSING, ACCEPTANCE, COMPLETION, OR SETTLEMENT OF ANY TRANSACTIONS.

**b.** BECAUSE AMAZON IS NOT INVOLVED IN TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN CUSTOMERS AND SELLERS OR OTHER PARTICIPANT DEALINGS, IF A DISPUTE ARISES BETWEEN ONE OR MORE PARTICIPANTS, EACH PARTICIPANT RELEASES AMAZON (AND ITS AGENTS AND EMPLOYEES) FROM CLAIMS, DEMANDS, AND DAMAGES (ACTUAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL) OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, SUSPECTED AND UNSUSPECTED, DISCLOSED AND UNDISCLOSED, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH SUCH DISPUTES.

8.   **Limitation of Liability.**

WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR OTHER THEORY), OR OTHERWISE) TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR COST OF COVER, RECOVERY, OR RECOUPMENT OF ANY INVESTMENT MADE BY YOU OR YOUR AFFILIATES IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, REVENUE, BUSINESS, OR DATA OR PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF AMAZON HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THOSE COSTS OR DAMAGES. FURTHER, OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED WILL NOT EXCEED AT ANY TIME THE TOTAL AMOUNTS DURING THE PRIOR SIX MONTH PERIOD PAID BY YOU TO AMAZON IN CONNECTION WITH THE PARTICULAR SERVICE GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.

9.   **Insurance.**

If the gross proceeds from Your Transactions exceed the applicable Insurance Threshold during any month if the Elected Country is the United States or Canada, or each month over any period of three (3) consecutive months if the Elected Country is Mexico, or otherwise if requested by us, then within thirty (30) days thereafter, you will maintain at your expense throughout the remainder of the Term for each applicable Elected Country commercial general, umbrella or excess liability insurance with the Insurance Limits per occurrence and in aggregate covering liabilities caused by or occurring in conjunction with the operation of your business, including products, products/completed operations and bodily injury, with policy(ies) naming Amazon and its assignees as additional insureds. At our request, you will provide to us certificates of insurance, the full insurance policy, or other documents we may request for the coverage to the following address: c/o Amazon, P.O. Box 81226, Seattle, WA 98108-1226, Attention: Risk Management.

10.   **Tax Matters.** 

As between the parties, you will be responsible for the collection, reporting, and payment of any and all of Your Taxes, except to the extent that (i) Amazon automatically calculates, collects, or remits taxes on your behalf according to applicable law; or (ii) Amazon expressly agrees to receive taxes or other transaction-based charges on your behalf in connection with tax calculation services made available by Amazon and used by you. You agree to and will comply with the [Tax Policies](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/help.html?itemID=200405820&language=en_US&ref=efph_200405820_cont_521). All fees and payments payable by you to Amazon under this Agreement or the applicable Service Terms are exclusive of any applicable taxes, deductions or withholding (including but not limited to cross-border withholding taxes), and you will be responsible for paying Amazon any of Your Taxes imposed on such fees and any deduction or withholding required on any payment.

11.   **Confidentiality and Personal Data.**

During the course of your use of the Services, you may receive Confidential Information. You agree that for the term of the Agreement and 5 years after termination: (a) all Confidential Information will remain Amazon's exclusive property; (b) you will use Confidential Information only as is reasonably necessary for your participation in the Services; (c) you will not otherwise disclose Confidential Information to any other Person except as required to comply with the Law; (d) you will take all reasonable measures to protect the Confidential Information against any use or disclosure that is not expressly permitted in this Agreement; and (e) you will retain Confidential Information only for so long as its use is necessary for participation in the Services or to fulfill your statutory obligations (e.g. tax) and in all cases will delete such information upon termination or as soon as no longer required for the fulfillment of statutory obligations. The foregoing sentence does not restrict your right to share Confidential Information with a governmental entity that has jurisdiction over you, provided that you limit the disclosure to the minimum necessary and explicitly indicate the confidential nature of the shared information to the governmental entity. You may not issue any press release or make any public statement related to the Services, or use our name, trademarks, or logo, in any way (including in promotional material) without our advance written permission, or misrepresent or embellish the relationship between us in any way. You may only use the "Available at Amazon" badge as defined in and according to the [Trademark Usage Guidelines](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/200573210?language=en-US&ref=mpbc_201713630_cont_200573210) available in Seller Central; you may not use our name, trademarks, or logos in any way (including in promotional material) not covered by the Trademark Usage Guidelines without our advance written permission.

Generally, you may not use customer personal data in any way inconsistent with applicable Law. You must keep customer personal data confidential at all times (the above 5 years’ term limit does not apply to customer personal data).

12.   **Force Majeure.**

We will not be liable for any delay or failure to perform any of our obligations under this Agreement by reasons, events or other matters beyond our reasonable control.

13.   **Relationship of Parties.**

Subject to the Transaction Processing Service Terms (if the Elected Country for a Service is the United States), you and we are independent contractors, and nothing in this Agreement will create any partnership, joint venture, agency, franchise, sales representative, or employment relationship between us. You will have no authority to make or accept any offers or representations on our behalf. This Agreement will not create an exclusive relationship between you and us. Nothing expressed or mentioned in or implied from this Agreement is intended or will be construed to give to any person other than the parties to this Agreement any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or in respect to this Agreement. This Agreement and all of the representations, warranties, covenants, conditions, and provisions in this Agreement are intended to be and are for the sole and exclusive benefit of Amazon, you, and customers. As between you and us, you will be solely responsible for all obligations associated with the use of any third party service or feature that you permit us to use on your behalf, including compliance with any applicable terms of use. You will not make any statement, whether on your site or otherwise, that would contradict anything in this section.

14.   **Suggestions and Other Information.**

If you or any of your Affiliates elect to provide or make available suggestions, comments, ideas, improvements, or other feedback or materials to us in connection with or related to any Amazon Site or Service (including any related Technology), we will be free to use, disclose, reproduce, modify, license, transfer and otherwise distribute, and exploit any of the foregoing information or materials in any manner. In order to cooperate with governmental requests, to protect our systems and customers, or to ensure the integrity and operation of our business and systems, we may access and disclose any information we consider necessary or appropriate, including but not limited to user contact details, IP addresses and traffic information, usage history, and posted content. If we make suggestions on using the Services, you are responsible for any actions you take based on our suggestions.

15.   **Modification.**

15.1. We will provide at least 15 days’ advance notice in accordance with Section 18 for changes to the Agreement.

15.2 However, we may change or modify the Agreement at any time with immediate effect (a) for legal, regulatory, fraud and abuse prevention, or security reasons; (b) to change existing features or add additional features to the Services (where this does not materially adversely affect your use of the Services); or (c) to restrict products or activities that we deem unsafe, inappropriate, or offensive. We will notify you about any change or modification in accordance with Section 18.

15.3 Your continued use of the Services after the effective date of any change to this Agreement in accordance with this Section 15 will constitute your acceptance of that change. If any change is unacceptable to you, you agree not to use the Services and to end the Agreement as described in Section 3.

16.   **Password Security.**

Any password we provide to you may be used only during the Term to access Seller Central (or other tools we provide, as applicable) to use the Services, electronically accept Your Transactions, and review your completed transactions. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your password. You may not disclose your password to any third party (other than third parties authorized by you to use your account in accordance with this Agreement) and are solely responsible for any use of or action taken under your password. If your password is compromised, you must immediately change your password.

17.   **Export.**

You will not directly or indirectly export, re-export, transmit, or cause to be exported, re-exported or transmitted, any commodities, software or technology to any country, individual, corporation, organization, or entity to which such export, re-export, or transmission is restricted or prohibited, including any country, individual, corporation, organization, or entity under sanctions or embargoes administered by the United Nations, US Departments of State, Treasury or Commerce, the European Union, or any other applicable government authority.

18.   **Miscellaneous.**

The Governing Laws will govern this Agreement, without reference to rules governing choice of laws or the Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. If the Elected Country is the United States, Canada, or Mexico, **Amazon and you both consent that any dispute with Amazon or its Affiliates or claim relating in any way to this Agreement or your use of the Services will be resolved by binding arbitration as described in this paragraph, rather than in court**, except that (i) either party may elect to proceed in a small claims court that is a Governing Court if your claims qualify; (ii) you or we may bring suit in the Governing Courts, submitting to the jurisdiction of the Governing Courts and waiving our respective rights to any other jurisdiction, to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights; and (iii) we may bring any claims related to your sale of counterfeit products on the Amazon Site in the Governing Courts or the court of your domicile or habitual residence and seek any remedy available under law related to those claims. **There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of this Agreement as a court would.** Before you may begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter notifying us of your intent to pursue arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent, CSC 300 Deschutes Way SW, Suite 208 MC-CSC1, Tumwater, WA 98501. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its commercial rules. The expedited procedures of the AAA’s rules will apply only in cases seeking exclusively monetary relief under $50,000, and in such cases the hearing will be scheduled to take place within 90 days of the arbitrator’s appointment. For all cases, the AAA commercial fee schedule governs the payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees. The underlying award in the arbitration may be appealed pursuant to the AAA’s Optional Appellate Arbitration Rules. **Amazon and you each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.** If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration **Amazon and you each waive any right to a jury trial**.

You may not assign this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. Any attempt to assign or otherwise transfer in violation of this section is void; provided, however, that upon notice to Amazon, you may assign or transfer this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any of your Affiliates as long as you remain liable for your obligations that arose prior to the effective date of the assignment or transfer under this Agreement. You agree that we may assign or transfer our rights and obligations under this Agreement: (a) in connection with a merger, consolidation, acquisition or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or similar transaction; or (b) to any Affiliate or as part of a corporate reorganization; and effective upon such assignment, the assignee is deemed substituted for Amazon as the party to this Agreement. Subject to that restriction, this Agreement will be binding on, inure to, and be enforceable against the parties and their respective successors and assigns. We may perform any of our obligations or exercise any of our rights under this Agreement through one or more of our Affiliates. Amazon retains the right to immediately halt any of Your Transactions, prevent or restrict access to the Services or take any other action to restrict access to or availability of any inaccurate listing, any inappropriately categorized items, any unlawful items, or any items otherwise prohibited by applicable Program Policies. Because Amazon is not your agent (except for the limited purpose set out in the Transaction Processing Service Terms (if the Elected Country for a Service is the United States)), or the customer’s agent for any purpose, Amazon will not act as either party's agent in connection with resolving any disputes between participants related to or arising out of any transaction.

Amazon will provide notice to you under this Agreement by posting changes to Seller Central or to the applicable Amazon Services site to which the changes relate (such as the Developer Site accessible through your account), by sending you an email notification, or by similar means. You must send all notices and other communications relating to Amazon to our Selling Partner Support team via Seller Central, email, the Contact Us form, or similar means. We may also communicate with you electronically and in other media, and you consent to such communications. You may change your e-mail addresses and certain other information in Seller Central, as applicable. You will ensure that all of your information is up to date and accurate at all times.

If any provision of this Agreement is deemed unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from these terms and conditions and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. If the Elected Country is Canada, then it is the express wish of the parties that this Agreement and the applicable Service Terms and Program Policies have been drafted in English. (The following is a French translation of the preceding sentence: Si le pays de service est le Canada, les parties conviennent que la présente autorisation et tous les termes et conditions applicables s'y rattachant soient rédigés en anglais.) We may make available translations to this Agreement and the applicable Service Terms and Program Policies, but the English version will control. This Agreement represents the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Services and related subject matter and supersedes any previous or contemporaneous oral or written agreements and understandings.

**Fulfillment Services**

**F-1 Your Products**

Once you are accepted into FBA, you must apply to register each product you offer that you wish to include in the FBA program. We may refuse registration in FBA of any product, including on the basis that it is an FBA Excluded Product or that it violates applicable Program Policies.

You will, in accordance with applicable Program Policies, provide accurate and complete information about Your Products registered in FBA, and will provide Fulfillment Requests for any Units fulfilled using FBA that are not sold through an Amazon Site (**"Multi-Channel Fulfillment Units"**). You will promptly update any information about Your Products in accordance with our requirements and as necessary so that the information is at all times accurate and complete.

**F-3 Shipping to Amazon**

**F-3.1** Except as otherwise provided in Section F-3.4 and Section F-5, FBA is limited to Units that are shipped to and from fulfillment centers located within the applicable Elected Country, to be delivered to customers in the same Elected Country only. You will ship Units to us in accordance with applicable Program Policies. You will be responsible for all costs incurred to ship the Units to the shipping destination (including costs of freight and transit insurance) and Amazon will not pay any shipping costs. You are responsible for payment of all customs, duties, taxes, and other charges. In the case of any improperly packaged or labeled Unit, we may return the Unit to you at your expense (pursuant to Section F-7) or re-package or re-label the Unit and charge you an administrative fee.

**F-3.2** You will not deliver to us any Unsuitable Unit; we may reject any shipment of Your Products.

**F-3.3** We may, at our option, allow you to ship Units at your expense (as described in Section F-9.2) to fulfillment centers using discounted shipping rates that we may make available to you for certain carriers. In such event, you will use the processes and supply the information that we require for you to obtain such discounted rates. You also must comply with standard operating procedures, weight and size restrictions, and other shipping requirements of the applicable carriers. If we provide you with the estimated shipping costs prior to shipment, you acknowledge and agree that actual shipping costs may vary from such estimates. In addition, if the weight of the Unit, as determined by the applicable carrier, differs from that submitted by you to us for purposes of determining the estimated shipping costs, then: (a) you may be charged more than the estimated shipping costs if the carrier determines that such Unit weighs more than as submitted by you; or (b) you may be charged the full amount of the estimated shipping costs even if the carrier determines the weight to be less than that submitted by you. You will not use carrier account information (e.g., carrier account number, amount of shipping rates, etc.) for any purpose, nor disclose such information to any third party, and you will protect such information as Amazon's confidential information in accordance with Section 11 of the General Terms of this Agreement. As between you, us, and the applicable carrier, you will be the shipper of record, and we will make payment to the carrier with respect to the shipment of all Units using such discounted rates. Title and risk of loss for any Unit shipped using discounted rates provided by us under this Section will remain with you, and our provision of such shipping rates will not create any liability or responsibility for us with respect to any delay, damage, or loss incurred during shipment. You authorize the applicable carrier to provide us with all shipment tracking information.

**F-3.4** If you ship Units from outside the applicable Elected Country to fulfillment centers, you will list yourself as the importer/consignee and nominate a customs broker. If Amazon is listed on any import documentation, Amazon reserves the right to refuse to accept the Units covered by the import documents and any costs assessed against or incurred by Amazon will be collected from Your Bank Account, deducted from amounts payable to you, or by other method at our election.

**F-4 Storage**

We will provide storage services as described in these FBA Service Terms once we confirm receipt of delivery. We will keep electronic records that track inventory of Units by identifying the number of Units stored in any fulfillment center. We will not be required to physically mark or segregate Units from other inventory units (e.g., products with the same Amazon standard identification number) owned by us, our Affiliates or third parties in the applicable fulfillment center(s). If we elect to commingle Units with such other inventory units, both parties agree that our records will be sufficient to identify which products are Units. We may move Units among facilities. If there is a loss of or damage to any Units while they are being stored, we will, compensate you in accordance with the [FBA Guidelines](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/G53921), and you will, at our request, provide us a valid tax invoice for the compensation paid to you. If we compensate you for a Unit, we will be entitled to dispose of the Unit pursuant to Section F-7. At all other times, you will be solely responsible for any loss of, or damage to, any Units. Our confirmed receipt of delivery does not: (a) indicate or imply that any Unit has been delivered free of loss or damage, or that any loss or damage to any Unit later discovered occurred after confirmed receipt of delivery; (b) indicate or imply that we actually received the number of Units of Your Product(s) specified by you for such shipment; or (c) waive, limit, or reduce any of our rights under this Agreement. We reserve the right to change scheduling restrictions and volume limitations on the delivery and storage of your inventory in fulfillment centers in accordance with Section 15 of the General Terms, and you will comply with any of these restrictions or limitations.

As part of our fulfillment services, we will ship Units from our inventory of Your Products to the shipping addresses in the Elected Country included in valid customer orders, or submitted by you as part of a Fulfillment Request. We may ship Units together with products purchased from other merchants, including any of our Affiliates. We also may ship Units separately that are included in a single Fulfillment Request. If you participate in our export fulfillment services, we will also ship Your Products that we determine to be eligible (each, a **"Foreign-Eligible Product"**) to Foreign Addresses within countries we determine to be eligible for foreign shipments, subject to the additional terms on foreign shipments in the applicable [FBA Guidelines](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/G53921).

**F-6 Customer Returns**

**F-6.1** You will be responsible for and will accept and process returns of, and provide refunds and adjustments for, any Multi-Channel Fulfillment Units in accordance with the Agreement (including the applicable Program Policies).

**F-6.2** We will receive and process returns of any Amazon Fulfillment Units that were shipped to addresses within the Elected Country in accordance with the terms of your Seller Agreement, these FBA Service Terms, and the Program Policies. Any Sellable Units that are also Amazon Fulfillment Units and that are properly returned will be placed back into the inventory of Your Products in the FBA Program. We may fulfill customer orders for Your Products with any returned Amazon Fulfillment Units. Except as provided in Section F-7, you will retake title of all Units that are returned by customers.

**F-6.3** Subject to Section F-7, we will, at your direction, either return or dispose of any Unit that is returned to us by a customer and that we determine is an Unsuitable Unit.

**F-6.4** If Amazon receives a customer return of a Multi-Channel Fulfillment Unit, you will direct us to return or dispose of the Unit at your own cost failing which we may dispose of the Unit as provided in Section F-7.

**F-7 Returns to You and Disposal**

**F-7.1** You may, at any time, request that Units be returned to you or that we dispose of Units.

**F-7.2** We may with notice return Units to you, including upon termination of these FBA Service Terms. Returned Units will be sent to your designated shipping address. However, if (a) the designated shipping address we have for you is outdated or incorrect, (b) you have not provided or, upon our request, confirmed a designated shipping address in the Elected Country, or (c) we cannot make arrangements for you to pay for the return shipment, then the Unit(s) will be deemed abandoned and we may elect to dispose of them as appropriate based on the inventory (e.g., by selling, donating, or recycling it) and retain any proceeds we may receive from the disposal.

We may dispose of any Unsuitable Unit (and you will be deemed to have consented to our action) (d) immediately if we determine that (i) the Unit creates a safety, health, or liability risk to Amazon, our personnel, or any third party; (ii) you have engaged in fraudulent or illegal activity; or (iii) we have cause to terminate your use of Services with immediate effect pursuant to Section 3 and are exposed to liability towards a third party; (e) if you fail to direct us to return or dispose of any Unsuitable Unit within thirty (30) days after we notify you that the Unit has been recalled; or (f) if you fail to indicate your removal preference for any Unsuitable Unit such disposal may be in any manner we deem appropriate (e.g., by selling, donating, or recycling,) and we may retain any proceeds received.

We will schedule removal of your Unsuitable Units, whether for return to you, liquidation or disposal on your behalf, at our earliest discretion (or as otherwise specified in the applicable Program Policies). In addition, you will reimburse us for expenses we incur in connection with any Unsuitable Units.

**F-7.3** You may, at any time, request that we dispose of Units. In this case, we may dispose of these Units as appropriate based on the inventory (e.g., by selling, recycling, donating, or destroying it) and retain any proceeds we may receive from the disposal. Title to each disposed Unit will transfer to us (or a third party we select such as a charity) at no cost, free and clear of any liens, claims, security interests or other encumbrances to the extent required to dispose of the Unit, and we may retain any proceeds, we may receive from the disposal.

**F-7.4** You will promptly notify us of any recalls or potential recalls, or safety alerts of any of Your Products and cooperate and assist us in connection with any recalls or safety alerts, including by initiating the procedures for returning items to you under our standard processes. You will be responsible for all costs and expenses you, we or any of our or your Affiliates incur in connection with any recall or potential recall or safety alerts of any of Your Products (including the costs to return, store, repair, liquidate, or deliver to you or any vendor any of these products).

**F-8 Customer Service**

**F-8.1** For Multi-Channel Fulfillment Units we will have no customer service obligations other than to pass any inquiries to your attention at the contact you provide, and to make available a reasonable amount of information regarding the status of the fulfillment of Your Products if you request it and if and to the extent we possess the requested information. You will ensure that all of your policies and messaging to your customers regarding shipping of Your Products and other fulfillment-related matters, reflect our policies and requirements, including with regard to shipping methods, returns, and customer service; and, you will conspicuously display on your website(s), in emails or in other media or communications any specific disclosures, messaging, notices, and policies we require.

**F-8.2** We will be responsible for all customer service issues relating to packaging, handling and shipment, and customer returns, refunds, and adjustments related to Amazon Fulfillment Units. We will determine whether a customer will receive a refund, adjustment or replacement for any Amazon Fulfillment Unit and we will require you to reimburse us where we determine you have responsibility in accordance with the Agreement (including these FBA Service Terms and the Program Policies). We will promptly notify you when you are responsible for a customer refund. You may appeal if you disagree with our finding within thirty (30) days after our notification, in addition to your right to request that Units be returned to you under Section F-7.1. Except as provided in this Section F-8 regarding any Amazon Fulfillment Units, customer service will be handled in accordance with your Seller Agreement.

**F-8.3** In situations relating to Amazon Fulfillment Units where the wrong item was delivered or the item was damaged or lost or is missing, unless we determine that the basis for such request is caused by you or any of your employees, agents, or contractors, we will, at our option: (a) for any Amazon Fulfillment Unit, (i) ship a replacement Unit to the customer and reimburse you in accordance with the [FBA Guidelines](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/G53921) for the replacement Unit, or (ii) process a refund to the customer and reimburse you in accordance with the FBA Guidelines for the Unit; or (b) for any Multi-Channel Fulfillment Unit, reimburse you in accordance with the FBA Guidelines for the Unit (and you will, at our request, provide us a valid tax invoice for the compensation paid to you). Any customer refund will be processed in accordance with the Selling on Amazon and the Transaction Processing Service Terms (if the Elected Country for a Service is the United States). Notwithstanding the Selling on Amazon Service Terms, we will be entitled to retain the applicable fees payable to us under the Selling on Amazon Service Terms and these FBA Service Terms, respectively. Except as expressly provided in this Section F-8.3, you will be responsible for all costs associated with any replacement or return.

**F-8.4** If we provide a replacement Unit or refund as described in Section F-8.3 to a customer and that customer returns the original Unit to us, we will be entitled to dispose of the Unit pursuant to Section F-7, or, if it is a Sellable Unit, we may, at our option, place such Unit back into your inventory in accordance with Section F-6. If we do put a Unit back into your inventory, you will reimburse us for the applicable Replacement Value (as described in the FBA Guidelines) of the returned Unit. Any replacement Unit shipped by us under these FBA Service Terms will be deemed to be, and will be treated in the same manner as, an order and sale of such Unit from you to the customer via the applicable Amazon Site or Service in accordance with, and subject to, the terms and conditions of this Agreement and your Seller Agreement.

**F-9 Compensation for Fulfillment Services**

**F-9.1 Handling and Storage Fees.** You will pay us the applicable fees described in the applicable Fulfillment by Amazon [Fee Schedule](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/201074400). You will be charged the Storage Fees beginning on the day (up to midnight) that the Unit arrives at a fulfillment center and is available for fulfillment by Amazon (or in the case of any Unsuitable Unit, the arrival day (up to midnight)), until the earlier of: (a) the day (up to midnight) we receive a valid customer order for such product or a request from you to return or dispose of the Unit; or (b) the day (up to midnight) we actually ship the Unit to your designated return location or dispose of the Unit.

**F-9.2 Shipping and Gift Wrap.** For any Amazon Fulfillment Units we will determine the amounts charged to the customer for shipping and gift wrap services for the Units that we fulfill through the FBA Program. As between you and us, these charges will be your charges to the customer, and we will report them to you. We will charge you (and you will pay us) a fee equal to the amount of such charges to the customer. In the case of shipments of Units sold through the Amazon Site that qualify for the "Free Shipping" promotion, the amounts charged to the customer for shipping the Selling on Amazon Units that Amazon fulfills will first be charged to the customer and will next be deducted from the total charges to the customer as your promotion and Amazon will not charge you the fee described above. If you ship Units to us using the shipping rates that we may make available pursuant to Section F-3.3, you will reimburse us for the actual amounts charged to us by the applicable carrier for such shipments.

**F-9.3 Proceeds.** We may as appropriate keep part of or all proceeds of any Units that we are entitled to dispose of pursuant to F-7 above, or to which title transfers, including returned, damaged, or abandoned Units. You will have no security interest, lien, or other claim to the proceeds that we receive in connection with the sale, fulfillment, and/or shipment of these Units.

**F-10 Indemnity**

In addition to your obligations under Section 6 of the General Terms of this Agreement, you also agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless us, our Affiliates, and our and their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives, and agents against any Claim that arises from or relates to: (a) the Units (whether or not title has transferred to us, and including any Unit that we identify as yours pursuant to Section F-4), including any personal injury, death, or property damage; (b) any of Your Taxes or the collection, payment, or failure to collect or pay Your Taxes; and, if applicable (c) any sales, use, value added, personal property, gross receipts, excise, franchise, business, or other taxes or fees, or any customs, duties, or similar assessments (including penalties, fines, or interest on any of the foregoing) imposed by any government or other taxing authority in connection with the shipment of Foreign-Eligible Products to Foreign Addresses (collectively, **"Foreign Shipment Taxes"**).

**F-11 Release**

You, on behalf of yourself and any successors, subsidiaries, Affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, employees, assigns, and any other person or entity claiming by, through, under, or in concert with them (collectively, the **"Releasing Parties"**), irrevocably acknowledge full and complete satisfaction of and unconditionally and irrevocably release and forever fully discharge Amazon and each of our Affiliates, and any and all of our and their predecessors, successors, and Affiliates, past and present, as well as each of our and their partners, officers, directors, shareholders, agents, employees, representatives, attorneys, and assigns, past and present, and each of them and all Persons acting by, through, under, or in concert with any of them (collectively, the **"Released Parties"**), from any and all claims, obligations, demands, causes of action, suits, damages, losses, debts, or rights of any kind or nature, whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, absolute or contingent, accrued or unaccrued, determined or speculative (collectively, **"Losses"**) which the Releasing Parties now own or hold or at any time have owned or held or in the future may hold or own against the Released Parties, or any of them, arising out of, resulting from, or in any way related to the shipment, export, or delivery of Your Products to Foreign Addresses, including any tax registration or collection obligations. You, on behalf of yourself and all other Releasing Parties, recognize that you, and each of them, may have some Losses, whether in tort, product liability, contract, warranty, or otherwise, against the Released Parties of which you, or any of them, are totally unaware and unsuspecting, or which may arise or accrue after the date you register for or use FBA, which the Releasing Parties are giving up by agreeing to these FBA Service Terms. It is your intention in agreeing to these FBA Service Terms that these FBA Service Terms will deprive the Releasing Parties of each and all such Losses and prevent the Releasing Party from asserting any such Losses against the Released Parties, or any of them. In addition to the foregoing, you acknowledge, on behalf of yourself and all other Releasing Parties that you are familiar with Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California, as follows:

**"A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party."**

You, on behalf of yourself and all other Releasing Parties, expressly waive and relinquish any rights that you had or may have under Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California or any similar provision of the law of any other jurisdiction, to the full extent that you may lawfully waive all such rights pertaining to the subject matter of these FBA Service Terms.

**F-12 Disclaimer**

IN ADDITION TO THE DISCLAIMER IN SECTION 7 OF THE GENERAL TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, WE DISCLAIM ANY DUTIES OF A BAILEE OR WAREHOUSEMAN, AND YOU WAIVE ALL RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF A BAILOR (WHETHER ARISING UNDER COMMON LAW OR STATUTE OR OTHERWISE), RELATED TO OR ARISING OUT OF ANY POSSESSION, STORAGE, OR SHIPMENT OF YOUR PRODUCTS BY US OR OUR AFFILIATES OR ANY OF OUR OR THEIR CONTRACTORS OR AGENTS.

**F-13 Effect of Termination**

Your termination rights are set forth in Section 3 of this Agreement. Following any termination of the Agreement or these FBA Service Terms in connection with a particular Elected Country, we will, as directed by you, return to you or dispose of the Units held in that Elected Country as provided in Section F-7. If you fail to direct us to return or dispose of the Units within fourteen (14) days (or as otherwise specified in the applicable Program Policies) after termination, then we may elect to return and/or dispose of the Units in whole or in part, as provided in Section F-7, and you agree to such actions. Upon any termination of these FBA Service Terms in connection with a particular Elected Country, all rights and obligations of the parties under these FBA Service Terms in connection with such Elected Country will be extinguished, except that the rights and obligations of the parties under Sections F-1, F-2, F-3, F-4, F-5, F-6, F-7, F-8, F-9, F-11, F-12, and F-13 with respect to Units received or stored by Amazon as of the date of termination will survive the termination.

**F-14 Tax Matters**

You understand and acknowledge that storing Units at fulfillment centers may create tax nexus for you in any country, state, province, or other localities in which your Units are stored, and you will be solely responsible for any taxes owed as a result of such storage. If any Foreign Shipment Taxes or Your Taxes are assessed against us as a result of performing services for you in connection with the FBA Program or otherwise pursuant to these FBA Service Terms, you will be responsible for such Foreign Shipment Taxes and Your Taxes and you will indemnify and hold Amazon harmless from such Foreign Shipment Taxes and Your Taxes as provided in Section F-10 of these FBA Service Terms.

**F-15 Additional Representation**

In addition to your representations and warranties in Section 5 of the General Terms of this Agreement, you represent and warrant to us that: (a) you have valid legal title to all Units and all necessary rights to distribute the Units and to perform under these FBA Service Terms; (b) you will deliver all Units to us in new condition (or in such condition otherwise described by you in the applicable Your Product listing) and in a merchantable condition; (c) all Units and their packaging will comply with all applicable marking, labeling, and other requirements required by Law; (d) no Unit is or will be produced or manufactured, in whole or in part, by child labor or by convict or forced labor; (e) you and all of your subcontractors, agents, and suppliers involved in producing or delivering Units will strictly adhere to all applicable Laws of the Elected Country, its territories, and all other countries where Units are produced or delivered, regarding the operation of their facilities and their business and labor practices, including working conditions, wages, hours, and minimum ages of workers; and (f) that all Foreign-Eligible Products (i) can be lawfully exported from Canada, Mexico, or the United States, as applicable, without any license or other authorization; and (ii) can be lawfully imported into, and comply with all applicable Laws of, any eligible country.

**FBA Definitions**

**"Amazon Fulfillment Units"** means Units fulfilled using FBA that are sold through an Amazon Site. For avoidance of doubt, if you have successfully registered for or used both the FBA and Selling on Amazon Services, then the term "Amazon Fulfillment Units" and the defined term "Amazon Fulfilled Products" in the Selling on Amazon Service Terms both refer to the same items.

**Amazon Advertising Service Terms**

The Amazon Advertising Service Terms govern your use of Amazon Advertising, a Service that allows you to advertise your products. The Amazon Advertising Service Terms apply to your use of the Ad Services.

Your use of the Ad Services (as defined in the Amazon Advertising Agreement) is governed by the Amazon Advertising Agreement. You accept the Amazon Advertising Agreement, which may be updated from time to time by Amazon in accordance with its terms. The Amazon Advertising Agreement is available at [https://advertising.amazon.com/terms](https://advertising.amazon.com/terms). In the event of any conflict between the General Terms or Program Policies and the Amazon Advertising Agreement with respect to the Ad Services, the Amazon Advertising Agreement will prevail to the extent of the conflict. If the Amazon Advertising Agreement is deemed unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then the General Terms will govern your access to and use of the Ad Services.

**Transaction Processing Service Terms**

BY REGISTERING FOR OR USING ANY SERVICE OTHER THAN AMAZON ADVERTISING FOR WHICH THE ELECTED COUNTRY IS THE UNITED STATES, YOU (ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF OR THE BUSINESS YOU REPRESENT) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TRANSACTION PROCESSING SERVICE TERMS FOR THAT SERVICE. **NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, IF A SEPARATE AGREEMENT GOVERNS THE OFFER, SALE OR FULFILLMENT OF YOUR PRODUCTS ON THE US AMAZON SITE, THE TERMS OF THAT AGREEMENT WILL CONTINUE TO GOVERN THE PROCESSING OF YOUR TRANSACTIONS TO THE EXTENT DESCRIBED IN THAT AGREEMENT.**

**P-1 Payments Processing Agency Appointment**

For non-invoiced orders, you authorize Amazon Payments, Inc. to act as your agent for purposes of processing payments, refunds and adjustments for Your Transactions, receiving and holding Sales Proceeds on your behalf, remitting Sales Proceeds to Your Bank Account, charging your Credit Card, and paying Amazon and its Affiliates amounts you owe in accordance with this Agreement or other agreements you may have with Amazon Affiliates. For invoiced orders, you authorize: (a) Amazon Capital Services, Inc. to act as your agent for purposes of processing payments, refunds and adjustments for Your Transactions, and receiving and holding Sales Proceeds on your behalf; and (b) Amazon.com Services LLC to act as your agent for purposes of remitting Sales Proceeds to Your Bank Account, charging your Credit Card, and paying Amazon and its Affiliates amounts you owe in accordance with this Agreement or other agreements you may have with Amazon Affiliates. Amazon Payments, Inc., Amazon Capital Services, Inc., and Amazon.com Services LLC are each an **“Amazon Payments Agent”**. The applicable Amazon Payments Agents provide the services described in these Transaction Processing Service Terms and the related services described in Sections S-1.4, S-2.2, S-5, and F-8.3 of the Agreement (collectively, the **"Transaction Processing Services"**).

When a buyer instructs us to pay you, you agree that the buyer authorizes and orders us to commit the buyer's payment (less any applicable fees or other amounts we may collect under this Agreement) to you. You agree that buyers satisfy their obligations to you for Your Transactions when we receive the Sales Proceeds. We will remit funds to you in accordance with this Agreement.

**P-2 Remittance** 

Subject to Section 2 of the General Terms of this Agreement, the applicable Amazon Payments Agents will remit funds to you in accordance with Section S-5 of the Agreement and these Transaction Processing Service Terms. Each applicable Amazon Payments Agent's obligation to remit funds collected or received by it or otherwise credited to your available balance in connection with Your Transactions is limited to funds in your available balance that have become available in accordance with this Agreement less amounts owed to Amazon and any taxes that Amazon automatically calculates, collects and remits to a tax authority according to applicable law, as specified in the Tax Policies, subject to chargeback or reversal or withheld for anticipated claims in accordance with this Agreement. Without limiting Amazon's rights to collect any amounts you owe, the applicable Amazon Payments Agent's receipt of Sales Proceeds or crediting of Sales Proceeds to your available balance discharges your obligation to pay applicable fees and other amounts under this Agreement to the extent the Sales Proceeds received or credited equal or exceed the fees and other amounts you owe and the Sales Proceeds are applied to the payment of those fees and amounts.

**P-3 Your Funds** 

Your Sales Proceeds will be held in an account with the applicable Amazon Payments Agent (a **"Seller Account"**) and will represent an unsecured claim against that Amazon Payments Agent. Your Sales Proceeds are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, nor do you have any right or entitlement to collect Sales Proceeds directly from any customer. Prior to disbursing funds to you, an Amazon Payments Agent may combine Sales Proceeds held with the funds of other users of the Services, invest them, or use them for other purposes permitted by applicable Laws. You will not receive interest or any other earnings on any Sale Proceeds. To the extent required by applicable Laws, an Amazon Payments Agent will not use any funds held on your behalf for its corporate purposes, will not voluntarily make such funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy or for any other purpose, and will not knowingly permit its creditors to attach such funds.

**P-4 Verification** 

We may at any time require you to provide any financial, business or personal information we request to verify your identity. Providing accurate identity verification, upon request, is a condition precedent to further disbursements following account suspension or termination. You authorize us to obtain from time to time consumer credit reports to establish or update your Seller Account or in the event of a dispute relating to this Agreement or the activity under your Seller Account. You agree to update all Seller Account information promptly upon any change. The [Amazon Payments Privacy Notice](https://pay.amazon.com/help/201751600) applies to transactions processed by Amazon Payments, Inc. This provision survives termination of the Agreement.

**P-5 Dormant Accounts** 

If there is no activity (as determined by us) in connection with your Seller Account for the period of time set forth in applicable unclaimed property laws and we hold Sales Proceeds on your behalf, we will notify you by means designated by us and provide you the option of keeping your Seller Account open and maintaining the Sales Proceeds in your Seller Account. If you do not respond to our notice(s) within the time period we specify, we will send the Sales Proceeds in your Seller Account to your state of residency, as determined by us based on the information in your Seller Account. If we are unable to determine your state of residency or your Seller Account is associated with a foreign country, your funds may be sent to the State of Delaware.

You are solely responsible for authorizing others to access the Selling Partner APIs on your behalf and taking your own steps to maintain appropriate security, protection, and backup of the Confidential Information and Your Materials processed pursuant to your access to the Selling Partner APIs and the API Materials, including any Confidential Information you have disclosed to Developers in accordance with this Agreement. We are not responsible for any unauthorized access to, alteration of, or deletion, destruction, damage, loss, or failure to store any of the Confidential Information or Your Materials in connection with the Selling Partner APIs (including as a result of your or any third party’s errors, acts, or omissions). If you believe (acting reasonably) that a personal data breach has occurred in relation to any customer personal data in your possession or otherwise under your control (including in the possession of a Developer), you shall immediately notify Amazon of such personal data breach (in sufficient detail) for information purposes, and promptly take any actions (or require a Developer take such actions, if relevant) as applicable to you under data privacy Laws.

**API-3 Termination**

**API-3.1 Termination of Your Access to the Selling Partner APIs and the API Materials.** 

Without limiting the parties’ rights and obligations under this Agreement, the Amazon Marketplace Developer Agreement, or the Amazon Marketplace API License Agreement, we may limit, suspend, or terminate your access to the Selling Partner APIs and the API Materials for convenience with 30 days’ notice.
