Terms and Conditions
====================

Please read this carefully because it sets out the terms of a legally binding agreement between you and the Financial Times. If you subscribe to receive the Financial Times newspaper, [our newspaper terms and conditions](https://help.ft.com/legal-privacy/terms-and-conditions/financial-times-newspaper-terms-and-conditions/) also apply.

1\. Introduction
----------------

This page sets out the terms and conditions on which you may use FT.com, the Financial Times newspaper and the content/services available on them (which we call “FT Content”). We only make these terms and conditions available in the English language.

In these terms we use the term “FT.com” to refer to our website at [FT.com](https://ft.com/) and our other mobile and online digital apps and services.

Except where we state otherwise in [Section 7](#anchor-user-generated-content), references in these terms and conditions to “FT” (or “we”, “us” or “our”) refer to the company operating FT.com. See [Section 12](#anchor-content-ownership) below for our corporate information.

These terms apply in different ways depending on what type of user you are, as follows:

**Registered users and personal subscribers:** These terms apply to your use of FT.com and all FT Content irrespective of the delivery platform or device you use to access it. By accessing FT.com you are agreeing to these terms and conditions. If you do not agree with the terms and conditions you should not use FT.com or any FT Content and should cancel any subscription in accordance with your cancellation rights (see [Section 6](#anchor-who-your-personal-subscription-contract-is-with) below). If you have any questions please contact [help@ft.com](mailto:help@ft.com).

We strongly recommend that you read these terms and conditions in their entirety. For further details of our registration and subscription options, please see our Registering and Subscribing Guide.

**Users with access under an organisation’s subscription agreement:** Your continued access is primarily governed by the subscription agreement of the organisation through which you are able to use the FT.com website. Sections 4 to 6 below are not applicable to such users. The remaining terms and conditions apply to your use of the FT.com website or any FT Content. By accessing FT.com you are agreeing to these terms and conditions. If you do not agree with these terms and conditions, then you should not use FT.com or any FT Content.

**All users:** These terms and conditions replace all previous terms and conditions for FT.com. FT may update these terms and conditions for legal or regulatory reasons, or to reflect changes in our services or business practices. We will provide notice of any significant changes in [Section 14](#anchor-changes-to-terms-and-conditions) below. You should regularly check [Section 14](#anchor-changes-to-terms-and-conditions) to see if any changes have been made. If you are an FT.com subscriber, any changes to our terms and conditions will become effective from the date of your next payment following the change unless we notify you otherwise. If you are not an FT.com subscriber, any changes will become effective as soon as we post them on FT.com.

We may in exceptional circumstances cease to publish FT.com, the FT Content or cease to provide subscription services. We will give you at least 90 days’ notice of this, if possible. If we do so, then we will have no further obligation to you, unless you are a personal subscriber in which case we will offer you a refund of the unexpired period of your paid subscription. See [Section 5](#anchor-renewals-and-cancellations) for details.

[](#anchor-access-and-use)2\. Access and Use
--------------------------------------------

Our ability to invest in high quality journalism depends on our users complying with this [Section 2](#anchor-access-and-use). Please read our [Copyright Policy](https://help.ft.com/legal-privacy/copyright-policy/) that summarises how you are allowed to use FT Content and provides guidance on the types of use we do not permit without the purchase of additional licences from the FT. You agree that you will comply with our Copyright Policy.

Organisations that may be using FT Content without the appropriate permissions may approach us with a view to discussing the purchase of a licence to legitimise that use. See [http://ftcorporate.ft.com/](http://ftcorporate.ft.com/) for details.

The amount and types of FT Content that you can view, and the platforms on which you can view FT Content, depend on what type of user you are and what type of subscription (if any) you have. We can vary the access rights of registered users who are not accessing through a paid subscription at any time at our discretion.

For further access, we offer various types of individual and corporate subscriptions; see [Section 4](#anchor-personal-subscription-services) for details of individual subscriptions, and [http://ftcorporate.ft.com/](http://ftcorporate.ft.com/) for details of our corporate subscriptions. If you already have a subscription, details of your access rights can be found at [Your Account](https://registration.ft.com/youraccount/subscriptions).

3\. Privacy Policy and Registration
-----------------------------------

All information received by us from your use of FT.com will be used by FT in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://help.ft.com/legal-privacy/privacy-policy/). Please read this for details of how we may process your personal data.

On registration, you must provide FT with accurate, complete registration information and it is your responsibility to update and maintain changes to that information on the applicable FT.com registration or subscription pages. FT is entitled to rely on any information you provide to us.

Each registration is for a single user only. On registration, you will choose a user name and password (“ID”). The email address that you provide on registration must correspond to a named email account and not a generic or shared email account. You are not allowed to share your ID or give access to FT Content through your ID to anyone else. FT does not allow multiple users on a network or within an organisation to use the same ID. FT may cancel or suspend your access to FT.com if you share your ID without further obligation to you. You may not create additional registration or subscription accounts for the benefit of others or with the aim of avoiding our use of IDs to control access to and use of FT.com.

You are responsible for all use of FT.com made by you or anyone else using your ID and for preventing unauthorised use of your ID. If you believe there has been any breach of security such as the disclosure, theft or unauthorised use of your ID or any payment information, you must notify FT immediately by e-mailing us at [help@ft.com](mailto:help@ft.com). We recommend that you do not select an obvious user password (such as your name) and that you change it regularly.

If you provide FT with an email address that will result in any messages FT may send you being sent to you via a network or device operated or owned by a third party (e.g. your employer or colleague) then you promise that you are entitled to receive those messages. You also agree that FT may stop sending messages to you without notifying you.

If you are a registered user of or subscriber to FT.com then you may choose to use FT.com’s “Remember me” login feature that enables you to be logged in automatically to FT.com whenever you visit FT.com without having to manually log in each time. We recommend that you do not enable this feature on any computer that is or may be used by anyone other than you in order to prevent unauthorised access by third parties to both your subscription details and features of FT.com personal to you.

4\. Personal Subscription Services and Temporary Access Passes
--------------------------------------------------------------

We offer subscription services through FT.com and recommend that you read our Frequently Asked Questions for more details and before purchasing a subscription.

**Types of subscription:** Unless you purchase a subscription to use FT.com then your usage rights will be limited as set out at [www.ft.com/psp](https://www.ft.com/psp). We offer various types of subscription: the options currently available are set out at [www.ft.com/psp](https://www.ft.com/psp).

In certain countries we also offer what we call a “Bundled Subscription” which allows you to purchase an FT.com subscription together with a subscription to buy the Financial Times newspaper.

FT reserves the right to vary the amount of content and types of service that it makes available to different categories of user. If you are an FT.com subscriber, any significant reduction in the scope of your subscription will take effect only after we have given you at least 30 days’ notice, and will apply from the date of your next payment following that 30-day period. This does not apply where a type of content or service intended for Premium subscriptions is made available to Standard subscribers on an introductory, temporary or trial basis.

**Contract formation:** FT will try to process your subscription promptly but does not guarantee that your subscription will be activated by any specified time. By submitting your payment and other subscription details, you are making an offer to us to buy a subscription. Your offer will only be accepted by us and a contract formed when we have successfully verified your payment details and email address, at which point we will provide you with access to your subscription. FT reserves the right to reject any offer in its discretion, for any or no reason.

**Payment details:** When you purchase a subscription, you must provide us with complete and accurate payment information. By submitting payment details you promise that you are entitled to purchase a subscription using those payment details. If we do not receive payment authorisation or any authorisation is subsequently cancelled, we may immediately terminate or suspend your access to your subscription. In suspicious circumstances we may contact the issuing bank/payment provider and/or law enforcement authorities or other appropriate third parties. If you are entitled to a refund under these terms and conditions we will credit that refund to the card or other payment method you used to submit payment, unless it has expired in which case we will contact you.

**Pricing:** The subscription price will be made clear to you on our sign-up pages or otherwise during the sign-up process and may vary from time to time or by country. You agree to pay the fees at the rates notified to you at the time you purchase your subscription. For certain subscriptions you can take out either an annual or monthly (or other frequency we offer) subscription. Other subscription services may only require a one-off payment. You can also take out any other fixed term or payment frequency that we may offer from time to time. The currency in which your subscription is payable will be specified during the order process, depending on the service and your country of residence. Eligibility for any discounts is ascertained at the time you subscribe and cannot be changed during the term of your subscription. We will always tell you in advance of any increase in the price of your subscription and offer you an opportunity to cancel it if you do not wish to pay the new price.

**Trial subscriptions:** Where we provide a trial subscription, we will inform you of the full subscription price that is payable after the trial period. After the trial, your subscription will renew automatically at the full subscription price unless you cancel your subscription before the end of the trial. To cancel your subscription during the trial please go to [Manage Your Account](https://registration.ft.com/youraccount/details/core/view?execution=e2s1) and follow the simple cancellation instructions.

Please note that no more than one trial subscription per subscriber is allowed in any twelve month period. We reserve the right to cancel any trial subscription immediately, without refund, if we become aware that the subscriber has already had another trial subscription in the previous twelve months.

**Taxes:** Financial Times Limited (FT) is registered for VAT in a number of European Union (EU) countries. We also have some non-EU indirect tax registrations. Our UK VAT registration number is GB226162332. If you want any of our other tax ID numbers please contact [Customer Care](https://help.ft.com/contact/).

Unless otherwise indicated, prices stated on our website are inclusive of any applicable value added tax (VAT) or other sales taxes. The breakdown of any applicable VAT payable with your order is indicated on the invoice you will receive with your purchase.

If you are based in the EU outside the UK, please click here for important information on how VAT is included in our prices.

**Pricing errors:** If we incorrectly state a price to you whether online or otherwise, we are not obliged to provide you with a subscription at that price, even if we have mistakenly accepted your offer to buy a subscription at that price, and we reserve the right to subsequently notify you of any pricing error. If we do this, you may cancel the subscription without any obligation to us and we will refund you any money you have paid us in full, or you may pay the correct price. If you refuse to exercise either of these choices then we may cancel your subscription and will refund you any money you have paid us in full. We will always act in good faith in determining whether a genuine pricing error has occurred.

**Other costs:** In addition to the subscription fee you are charged, certain banks and credit card issuers will charge a foreign transaction fee on transactions which take place abroad or in a foreign currency. The majority of payments for subscriptions we take by card are processed in the United Kingdom therefore please check with your bank or credit card issuer to find out if such charges will be applied to you; the FT is not responsible for any such charges. You are also responsible for paying any internet connection or telecommunications charges that you may incur by accessing FT.com or using the services available on it. For example, if you use any of our mobile services then your network operator may charge you for data or messaging services.

**Moving house:** If you have a bundled subscription and are moving house, then we will transfer your newspaper delivery to your new address. However, if we are unable to provide you with a home delivery service to your new address, we will provide you with a pro rata refund for the newspaper element of your subscription, which means that we will refund part of your subscription fee for the unexpired period of the subscription.

**Newspaper delivery:** FT will aim to commence delivery of the Financial Times newspaper to you within 2 business days (UK), 7-10 business days (Eurozone) or 10-12 business days (United States) of your subscription commencing, delivery times for other regions will be confirmed to you separately. Once delivery has commenced, the Financial Times newspaper will be delivered Monday through to Saturday at the one delivery address specified when your order was confirmed.

5\. Renewal and Cancellation of Personal Subscriptions
------------------------------------------------------

**Renewals: If you chose to pay monthly**, your subscription will continue until you tell us that you no longer wish to receive it, in which case you will stop paying the monthly fees. We will notify you at least 14 days in advance of any changes to the price in your subscription that will apply upon next monthly renewal. Please see the “How to cancel” section below for details of how to cancel your monthly subscription. **If you chose to pay annually**, at least 14 days before each renewal you will be sent a reminder notice stating the rate that will apply for the renewal period. Unless you notify us before the end of your annual subscription period that you no longer wish to receive it, your annual subscription will renew for another year. We will charge the subscription using the same card or other payment method that you previously used.  For voucher pack subscribers, if you choose to cancel we reserve the right to charge you the subscription fee for the renewal period if we have sent you voucher packs that have not been returned before your subscription start date. We will provide you with a refund of the subscription fee on receipt of the complete returned voucher pack.

**Initial cancellation period**: Depending on the type of subscription you have, you may have a right to cancel your subscription within a limited period after placing your order, as follows.

Online-only subscriptions: If your subscription does not include newspaper deliveries, then by placing your order you agree that we may start your subscription immediately upon our accepting your order. This means that you are not entitled to a refund if you change your mind after we have provided you with access to your subscription.

Newspaper or bundled subscriptions: If your subscription includes newspaper deliveries (with or without any digital access), then you have the right to cancel your subscription, without giving any reason, within a **14 day** period from the day on which you receive the first newspaper forming part of your subscription. If you exercise your right to cancel within that period, then we will reimburse all payments received from you, less a pro-rated amount for each newspaper you received before cancelling. You do not need to return any of the newspapers to us. For more details (including an optional cancellation form), see our [cancellation information](https://help.ft.com/faq/changing-your-subscription/what-are-my-cancellation-rights/).

**Subsequent cancellation of your subscription**: Except as set out in the previous section, you do not have any right to cancel your subscription or any part of it until the end of your then current subscription period. Although you may notify us of your intention to cancel at any time, such notice will only take effect at the end of your then current subscription period, and you will not receive a refund (except in the limited circumstances set out in these terms). For voucher pack subscribers, you must return any voucher packs we have sent you that relate to further subscription periods by post to the address printed on the back of the voucher pack.

**How to cancel:** You may notify us of your wish to cancel your subscription by contacting our Customer Care team. [Chat with us online, call us on your regional telephone number](https://help.ft.com/contact/), or email us at [help@ft.com](mailto:help@ft.com) with the following: “I/We hereby give notice that I/we cancel my/our subscription”. Please then include:

*   The subscriber's full name (person on the billing information if different from the user)
*   The Account email address or Account Number (Customer Reference Number)
*   The billing address or delivery address (Including zip code/postcode)
*   Your contact telephone number

You may also use your [regional telephone number](https://help.ft.com/contact/) to temporarily suspend your newspaper delivery if you have an FT Bundled subscription, for example if you are going on holiday, although you must provide at least 5 business days' advance notice for this to be implemented.

**Cancellations by us:** FT reserves the right to suspend or terminate your subscription if you breach these terms and conditions, with or without notice and without further obligation to you. We may also suspend or terminate your subscription if we are prevented from providing services to you by circumstances beyond our control. If we terminate your subscription for any reason and/or permanently cease publishing FT.com, the FT Content or cease to provide subscription services then, unless there are exceptional circumstances, we will provide you with a pro rata refund to your credit card. This means that we will refund you with any amounts that you have paid us in advance that relate to any remaining and unexpired period of your subscription.

FT reserves the right to suspend or terminate your subscription without refund in the event of any verbal or written abuse of any kind (including abusive, offensive or aggressive language) directed towards our Customer Care team or other FT personnel.

**Cancellation of your registration:** If you are a registered user, but not a subscriber, then FT reserves the right to suspend or terminate your registration at any time, with or without notice and without further obligation to you. If you would like to cancel your registration then please contact our Customer Care team at [help@ft.com](mailto:help@ft.com) or using the telephone numbers set out above.

7\. User Generated Content
--------------------------

FT.com includes comments sections, blogs and other interactive features that allow interaction between users and between users and FT journalists (we call these “Forums”). We call the information posted to these Forums by users “User Generated Content” or “UGC”.

If you wish to view or participate in a Forum then you must comply with any specific rules posted on the Forum. We also recommend that you read our Comments Guidelines which provide further guidance in relation to commenting on FT.com.

You will retain ownership of the copyright in any of your UGC that you or we publish on FT.com so you are free to re-use it as you wish. You agree that if you post UGC to a Forum then you are granting FT a right (but not an obligation) unlimited in time to publish, re-use, archive, modify, delete or commercially exploit that UGC in whole or in part as we see fit, whether on FT.com or otherwise, without any requirement to pay you for this and with or without attribution to you. This means that you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free licence to use any UGC you publish in whole or in part in any manner and for any purpose whatsoever and without further obligation to you. You also waive any moral rights that you may have in regard to the UGC.

You are responsible for all the content of any of your UGC that you or we publish. You are financially responsible to us for any claim against us by any third party that your UGC is not in accordance with the bullet points below or that otherwise relates to your UGC.

You agree that you will:

*   only publish UGC that is your original content and will not infringe the copyright or other rights of any third party when publishing UGC.
*   not post, link to or otherwise publish any UGC containing any form of advertising or promotion for goods and services or any spam or other form of unsolicited communication.
*   not post, link to or otherwise publish any UGC with recommendations to buy or not buy a particular share or other investment or which contain confidential information of another party or which otherwise have the purpose of affecting the price or value of any share or other investment.
*   not post, link to or otherwise publish any UGC that is threatening, offensive, libellous, indecent or otherwise unlawful.
*   not post comments that are discriminatory in nature, for example, comments which make attacks on the grounds of race, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, disability or age.
*   respectfully challenge different points of view but not personally attack other commentators.
*   not disguise the origin of any UGC and not impersonate any person or entity (including FT employees or Forum guests or hosts) or misrepresent any connection with any person or entity.
*   not post or otherwise publish any UGC unrelated to the Forum or the Forum’s topic.
*   not post or transmit any UGC that contains software viruses, files or code designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of FT.com or any computer software or equipment.
*   not collect or store other users’ personal data.
*   not restrict or inhibit any other user from using the Forums.
*   comply with the guidelines for commenting set out in our [Commenting FAQ](https://help.ft.com/faq/topic/commenting-on-articles).

The Forums contain UGC submitted by users over whom FT has no control so we cannot therefore guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of any UGC. Some users may not behave properly and may post UGC that is misleading, untrue or offensive.

It is not possible for FT to fully monitor all UGC published on FT.com but where we have actually received notice of any UGC that is potentially misleading, untrue, offensive, unlawful, infringes third party rights or is potentially in breach of these terms and conditions, then we will review that UGC, decide whether to remove it from FT.com and act accordingly. This may include banning a user from participation in UGC on FT.com.

Our moderation and community team may contact you from time to time regarding your comments. Comments, including those made under a pseudonym, can be linked to your FT.com account by FT.

For more guidance about commenting on FT.com, please see our Commenting FAQ. If you believe that any UGC published on FT.com infringes any legal rights that you may have or is not allowed under these terms and conditions, please notify us immediately with specific details by contacting us at [help@ft.com](mailto:help@ft.com).

8\. Third Party Sites and Services
----------------------------------

FT.com may contain links to other Internet websites or online and mobile services provided by independent third parties, including websites of our advertisers and sponsors (what we call “Third Party Sites”), either directly or through frames. Third Party Sites may be co-branded with FT and so include FT’s trade marks.

It is your decision whether you purchase or use any third party products or services made available on or via Third Party Sites and you should read [Section 9](#anchor-our-responsibilities-to-you) below carefully. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to Third Party Sites.

FT.com contains advertising and sponsorship. Advertisers and sponsors are responsible for ensuring that material submitted for inclusion on FT.com complies with international and national law. FT is not responsible for any error or inaccuracy in advertising or sponsorship material.

Copyright in any software that is made available for download from FT.com belongs to FT or its suppliers. Your use of the software is governed by the terms of any licence agreement that may accompany or be included with the software. Do not install or use any of this software unless you agree to such licence agreement. FT is not responsible for any technical or other issues that may happen if you download third party software.

9\. Our Responsibilities To You
-------------------------------

**A summary of what this section means:** this section is important and you should read it carefully. It makes clear to what extent, if any, FT accepts responsibility (liability) to you for your use of FT.com or the FT Content or in respect of any third party products or services that we refer to or link to on FT.com. Unless you are a personal subscriber to FT.com or have a temporary access pass, we accept no financial responsibility to you arising from your use of FT.com or the FT Content. If you are a personal subscriber to FT.com or have a temporary access pass, we limit our financial responsibility to you arising from your use of FT.com or the FT Content to the price you paid for your subscription or temporary access pass.

In no circumstances do we accept responsibility for your use of Third Party Sites or in respect of any Third Party Products. By Third Party Sites we mean websites, online or mobile services provided by third parties, including websites of advertisers and sponsors that may appear on FT.com. By Third Party Products we mean products or services provided by third parties.

Although this means that we accept very little in the way of financial responsibility for your use of FT.com and the FT Content, we think this is fair on the basis that you can view certain content and services free-of-charge, and the cost of a subscription or temporary access pass for additional access rights is relatively inexpensive. It is not commercially possible for us to accept more responsibility for your use of FT.com than set out in this [Section 9](#anchor-our-responsibilities-to-you) taking into account that we permit you to use FT.com for no or a relatively inexpensive cost.

### **Limitations of FT Content:**

**The FT Content (including any information we publish regarding Third Party Products) is only for your general information and entertainment purposes and is not intended to address your particular requirements. In particular, the FT Content, including UGC and any other content provided by third parties and distributed by FT.com, does not constitute any form of advice, recommendation, representation, endorsement or arrangement by FT. It is not intended to be and should not be relied upon by users in making (or refraining from making) any specific investment, purchase, sale or other decisions. Appropriate independent advice should be obtained before making any such decision, such as from a qualified financial adviser.**

**Any agreements, transactions or other arrangements made between you and any third party named on (or linked to from) FT.com are at your own responsibility and entered into at your own risk. Any information that you receive via FT.com, whether or not it is classified as ”real time”, may have stopped being current by the time it reaches you. Share price information may be rounded up/down and therefore may not be entirely accurate.**

### **What we promise:**

**FT promises to develop and operate FT.com with reasonable skill and care and will use reasonable efforts to promptly remedy any faults of which it is aware.**

### **What we do not promise:**

**FT does not provide any other promises or warranties about FT.com and the FT Content. FT.com and the FT Content are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. This means that FT does not make any promises in respect of FT.com or the services and functions available on or through FT.com or of the quality, completeness or accuracy of the information published on or linked to from FT.com other than as expressly stated above.**

**The above disclaimers apply equally to your use of FT.com and all FT Content. Without limiting the above, FT is not liable for matters beyond its reasonable control. FT does not control third party communications networks (including your internet service provider), the internet, acts of god or the acts of third parties.**

### **Our financial responsibility to you:**

**You agree that if we are in breach of these terms and conditions, we will only be responsible to you for any damages that you incur arising out of your use of FT.com or the FT Content (to the extent that FT’s liability is not otherwise excluded by this** **[section 9](#anchor-our-responsibilities-to-you)** **) as follows:**

*   **If you incur any loss as a result of using FT.com or any FT Content outside the scope of these terms and conditions, FT accepts no responsibility (liability) to you for this.**
*   **You will be responsible for all claims, liabilities, damages, cost and expenses suffered or incurred as a result of your breach of these terms and conditions.**
*   **FT will only be responsible for loss or damage you suffer which is the reasonably foreseeable result of FT’s breach of a legal duty of care owed to you, but in no event shall the liability of the FT or its affiliates exceed the amount, if any, paid by you to the FT for the particular subscription product to which the claim relates.**
*   **FT will not be responsible to you for any loss or damage suffered by your business, such as lost data, lost profits or any business interruption.**
*   **If you have a personal subscription then you may terminate your subscription immediately in writing to FT if FT.com is unavailable or inaccessible to you for either (a) more than 3 consecutive days during your subscription; or (b) more than 5 days in a 30 day period, as a result of the fault or failure of FT, in which case we will refund you any amount that you have paid to us in advance that relates to any period which was still to run on your subscription. You may instead at your option receive a renewal to your subscription free-of-charge at the point of renewal.**

**The limitations of liability in this** **[section 9](#anchor-our-responsibilities-to-you)** **apply for the benefit of FT, its affiliates, including those listed in** **[section 6](#anchor-who-your-personal-subscription-contract-is-with)** **and all of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents or any company who we transfer our rights and obligations to in accordance with these terms and conditions.**

**To the full extent permitted by law you acknowledge and agree that our third party content and data suppliers have no liability whatsoever to you in respect of any of their data supplied to you as part of the FT Content.**

**FT’s liability will not be limited in the case of death or personal injury directly caused by FT’s negligence in those countries where it is unlawful for FT to seek to exclude such liability.**

### **If you use either the Managed Funds or Personal Finance pages:**

**You agree that these areas of FT.com are designed for use by United Kingdom users only and you should not use them if you are ordinarily resident outside of the United Kingdom.**

10\. Choice of Law and Jurisdiction
-----------------------------------

If you are a user whose principal address or principal use of FT.com occurs in any jurisdiction other than the United States then these terms and conditions will be subject to English law. In this case, to the extent possible in the applicable jurisdiction, both you and we agree that the courts of England will (subject to the final paragraph in this Section 10) have non-exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute which may arise out of, under, or in connection with these terms and conditions.

If you are a user whose principal address or principal use of FT.com occurs in the United States then these terms and conditions will be subject to the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. In this case, to the extent possible in the applicable jurisdiction, both you and we agree that the courts of the State of New York will (subject to the final paragraph in this Section 10) have non-exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute which may arise out of, under, or in connection with these terms and conditions.

11\. General
------------

You may not license or transfer any of your rights under these terms and conditions. We may transfer any of our rights or obligations under these terms and conditions to any company within the Financial Times group of companies but if we do so we will ensure that any company to whom we transfer our rights or obligations will continue to honour your rights under them.
