[](#anchor-access-and-use)2\. Your Subscription to the FT Services
------------------------------------------------------------------

**Subscribing to the FT**

**2.1.** We offer a range of subscriptions:- 

*   to FT.com (“Digital Subscriptions”);
*   the Newspaper (“Print Subscriptions”),
*   to both FT.com and the Newspaper (“Bundled Subscriptions”); and 
*   we also offer subscriptions on a trial basis ("Trial Subscriptions")

The above are referred together as "**the Subscriptions**" and individually as a "Subscription". Please note that separate and/or additional terms and conditions may apply to any Trial Subscriptions that we may offer. Any such additional terms shall be clearly indicated. 

**2.2.** You may not take more than one Trial Subscription in any twelve-month period.  We may cancel any Trial Subscription that you may have purchased, without refund, if you have had access to any other Trial Subscription in the previous twelve months.

**2.3.** You may purchase a Subscription by submitting an order and providing the sign up details on FT.com, by phone, email, using our Live Chat on FT.com or by letter. We will only accept your order when we have successfully verified your email address, processed your payment details and emailed you to confirm this.

**2.4.** We will try to process your Subscription order promptly but cannot guarantee activation by any specified time. We may reject any Subscription order in our discretion. You confirm that your sign up and payment details are complete and accurate, and that you are entitled to purchase a Subscription using those sign up and payment details.  It is your responsibility to update and maintain changes to your sign up details on our [Manage Your Account](https://registration.ft.com/youraccount/details/core/view?execution=e2s1). Each Subscription is for a single user only. We may cancel or suspend your Subscription account if you share your access rights with any third parties, or attempt to allow third parties to avoid our control of access to FT.com. 

**Fees and Payment**

**2.5.** You agree to pay the Subscription fees at the rates and in the currency displayed during the Subscription process.  Prices may vary from time to time and by country, and Subscriptions may be available on a one-off, monthly, annual or other basis.  Discount offers are as stated at the time you subscribe and cannot be changed during the term of your subscription. Unless otherwise indicated, prices stated are inclusive of any applicable value added tax (VAT) or other sales taxes. The breakdown of any VAT will be indicated on the relevant invoice.

**2.6.** If we do not receive payment authorisation or any authorisation is subsequently cancelled, we may immediately terminate or suspend your Subscription. 

**2.7.** If you take a Trial Subscription, we will inform you of the full Subscription price payable at the start of the trial period. Your Subscription will renew automatically at the end of that trial period at the full Subscription price unless you cancel your Subscription before the end of the trial period. To cancel your Subscription during the trial period please go to [Manage Your Account](https://registration.ft.com/youraccount/details/core/view?execution=e2s1) and follow the simple cancellation instructions.

**2.8.** We will give you at least 14 days’ notice of any increase in the price of your Subscription, which will take effect at your next renewal date.

**2.9.** If we incorrectly state a price online or otherwise, we are not obliged to provide you with a Subscription at that price, even if we have mistakenly accepted your offer to buy a Subscription.  If we notify you of a pricing error, you may cancel the Subscription and we will refund you any money paid, or you may pay the correct price. If you do neither, we may cancel your Subscription and refund any money you have paid. We will always act in good faith in determining whether a genuine pricing error has occurred.

**2.10.** If you are entitled to a refund we will credit that refund to the card or other payment method you used to submit payment, unless it has expired in which case we will contact you to arrange.

**2.11.** In addition to the Subscription fees you are responsible for paying for any:

*   broadband, mobile, data, messaging or other internet connection and telecommunications charges that you may incur by accessing FT Content; 
*   charges that may be levied by your bank or credit card issuer (for example foreign transaction fees on transactions which take place abroad or in a foreign currency).

**2.12.** We will do all that we reasonably can to ensure that all of the information you give us when paying is secure by using an encrypted secure payment mechanism. However, in the absence of negligence on our part, any failure by us to comply with this contract or our Privacy Policy or breach by us of our duties under applicable laws, we will not be legally responsible to you for any loss that you may suffer if a third party gains unauthorised access to any information that you give us.

**Home Delivery**

**2.13.** We will deliver your Newspaper from Monday through to Saturday to the address you provided during the sign-up process if it is within our delivery areas. We do not guarantee delivery to non-secure locations or beyond ground floor levels.  Any special delivery requests may be printed on your Newspaper and seen by third parties, and we cannot guarantee that these requests will be fulfilled.

**2.14.** We aim to commence delivery of your Newspaper within 2 business days (UK), 7-10 business days (Eurozone) or 10-12 business days (United States) of your Subscription commencing.  Delivery times for other regions will be confirmed separately. 

**2.15.** If you do not receive your Newspaper on the expected delivery date, please [contact us](https://help.ft.com/contact/) within 7 days and we may arrange an extension or credit for that delivery (excluding Trial Subscriptions of 4 weeks or fewer).

**2.16.** If you wish to change your address for home delivery then please [contact us](https://help.ft.com/contact/) at least 10 days' before the date on which you wish your change of address to take effect. If we are not able to provide you with a home delivery service to your new address then:

*   If you have a Print Subscription we will cancel your Subscription and issue a pro rata refund for the unexpired period of your Subscription; and 
*   If you have a Bundled Subscription we will cancel your Subscription, issue a pro rata refund for the unexpired period of your Subscription and, at your option, transfer you onto a new Digital Subscription. 

**Paper or Digital Vouchers**

**2.17.** You may only redeem vouchers for Newspapers (subject to availability) at participating UK retailers on the date shown on the voucher, except FT Weekend which is also valid on the Sunday of the same weekend.  Vouchers cannot be exchanged for cash or any other products. You must not copy, resell or transfer vouchers to anyone else.  

**2.18.** Paper vouchers will be posted and digital vouchers will be emailed using the information you provided during the sign-up process. 

**2.19.** If your Subscription has been cancelled, vouchers will no longer be valid and you must promptly post any unused paper voucher packs to the address printed on the back of the pack.  We may provide a refund for any vouchers that relate to the remainder of a Subscription period you have already paid for, and we reserve the right to charge you for any voucher packs that have not been returned which relate to a period for which you have not yet paid. Paper and digital voucher subscriptions cannot be suspended by you at any time. 

**Your Cancellation Rights**

**2.20.** Digital Subscriptions:

*   By placing your order for a Digital Subscription subject to these Terms and Conditions, you agree that we may start your Subscription immediately upon our acceptance of your order and that you waive your statutory right to cancel our contract within 14 days of our confirmation email. 
*   This means that you lose your right to cancel this contract once we have provided confirmation via email of your Digital Subscription (see section 2.3 above) and that any notice of cancellation that you provide (whether before or after the 14-day period) will only take effect at the end of your current subscription period. You will not be entitled to a refund except in the event that there is a fault in our provision of our FT Services. 

**2.21.** Print Subscription or Bundled Subscription:

*   You have the right to cancel our contract for a Print Subscription or Bundled Subscription within 14 days of our confirmation email (see section 2.3 above) without giving any reason. 
*   If you exercise your right to cancel within that period, we will reimburse all payments received from you, less a pro rated amount for each Newspaper you received before cancelling.
*   After the above period has expired, you may cancel your Print Subscription or Bundled Subscription by notifying us at any time of your intention to do so. However, the cancellation will only take effect at the end of your then current Subscription period, and you will not be entitled to a refund except in the event that there is a fault in our provision of our FT Services.
*   You may terminate your Subscription immediately in writing to FT if FT.com is unavailable or inaccessible to you for either (a) any 72 hour period during your Subscription; or (b) more than five 24-hour periods over a 30 day period; in either case as a direct result of a fault or failure of FT, in which case we will refund you any amount that you have paid to us in advance that relates to any period which was still to run on your Subscription.

**2.22.** To exercise the above rights to cancel, you must inform us of your decision to cancel the contract by using [our online chat feature, calling us on your regional telephone number,](https://help.ft.com/contact/) or emailling us at [help@ft.com](https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1&to=help@ft.com) with the following: "I/We hereby give notice that I/we cancel my/our subscription". Please then include:

*   the subscriber's full name (person on the billing information if different from the user);
*   the Account email address or Account Number (Customer Reference Number);
*   the billing address and delivery address (Including zip code/postcode); and
*   your contact telephone number.

You may also use your [regional telephone number](https://help.ft.com/contact/) to temporarily suspend Newspaper delivery if you have an Bundled Subscription, for example if you are going on holiday, although you must provide at least 5 business days advance notice for this to be implemented. You will not be entitled to suspend your Subscription if you use paper or digital vouchers.

**Our Cancellation Rights**

**2.23.** We may suspend or terminate your Subscription if we are prevented from providing services to you, or accepting payment from you, by applicable law or circumstances beyond our control, or if we cease publishing the Newspaper or FT.com or FT Services. If we terminate for any of these reasons, we will provide you with a pro rata refund to the extent permitted by applicable law.

**2.24.** We may also suspend or terminate your Subscription, without refund, if you breach these Terms and Conditions, or in the event of any verbal or written abuse of any kind (including abusive, offensive or aggressive language) directed towards our Customer Care team, other FT personnel, or any member of the public, with or without notice and without further obligation to you. 

**2.25.** If you are not a Subscriber, then we may suspend or terminate your access to the FT Content at any time, with or without notice and without further obligation to you.

**Effects of cancellation**

**2.26.** If you are entitled to a refund, we will make the reimbursement without undue delay, and not later than 14 days after the day on which we are informed about your decision to cancel your Subscription.

**2.27.** We will make the reimbursement using your registered payment details detailed within [Manage Your Account](https://registration.ft.com/youraccount/details/core/view?execution=e2s1). Additional charges may apply if we are required to reimburse to any other credit card or bank. 

**2.28.** If you have received copies of the Newspaper as part of your Subscription, you will not be expected to return these copies, but we will retain payment for such in accordance with these Terms and Conditions.

**2.29.** If you access the FT Services by exchanging the Newspaper for voucher packs which are issued by us, we reserve the right to charge you the subscription fee for the renewal period if we have sent you voucher packs that have not been returned before your subscription start date. We will provide you with a refund of the subscription fee on receipt of the complete returned voucher pack.

**Renewals**

**2.30. Unless you notify us at least 14 days before the end of your current subscription period that you wish to cancel, your subscription will continue to renew for further equivalent periods and will be subject to these Terms and Conditions. We will charge the subscription using the same card or other payment method that you previously used. In the case of annual subscriptions, we will send you a reminder notice at least 14 days before the renewal date stating the rate that will apply for the renewal period.**
