Terms and Conditions
====================

Please read this carefully because it sets out the terms of a legally binding agreement between you and the Financial Times. If you subscribe to receive the Financial Times newspaper, [our newspaper terms and conditions](https://help.ft.com/legal-privacy/terms-and-conditions/financial-times-newspaper-terms-and-conditions/) also apply.

1\. Introduction
----------------

This page sets out the terms and conditions on which you may use FT.com, the Financial Times newspaper and the content/services available on them (which we call “FT Content”). We only make these terms and conditions available in the English language.

In these terms we use the term “FT.com” to refer to our website at [FT.com](https://ft.com/) and our other mobile and online digital apps and services.

Except where we state otherwise in [Section 7](#anchor-user-generated-content), references in these terms and conditions to “FT” (or “we”, “us” or “our”) refer to the company operating FT.com. See [Section 12](#anchor-content-ownership) below for our corporate information.

These terms apply in different ways depending on what type of user you are, as follows:

**Registered users and personal subscribers:** These terms apply to your use of FT.com and all FT Content irrespective of the delivery platform or device you use to access it. By accessing FT.com you are agreeing to these terms and conditions. If you do not agree with the terms and conditions you should not use FT.com or any FT Content and should cancel any subscription in accordance with your cancellation rights (see [Section 6](#anchor-who-your-personal-subscription-contract-is-with) below). If you have any questions please contact [help@ft.com](mailto:help@ft.com).

We strongly recommend that you read these terms and conditions in their entirety. For further details of our registration and subscription options, please see our Registering and Subscribing Guide.

**Users with access under an organisation’s subscription agreement:** Your continued access is primarily governed by the subscription agreement of the organisation through which you are able to use the FT.com website. Sections 4 to 6 below are not applicable to such users. The remaining terms and conditions apply to your use of the FT.com website or any FT Content. By accessing FT.com you are agreeing to these terms and conditions. If you do not agree with these terms and conditions, then you should not use FT.com or any FT Content.

**All users:** These terms and conditions replace all previous terms and conditions for FT.com. FT may update these terms and conditions for legal or regulatory reasons, or to reflect changes in our services or business practices. We will provide notice of any significant changes in [Section 14](#anchor-changes-to-terms-and-conditions) below. You should regularly check [Section 14](#anchor-changes-to-terms-and-conditions) to see if any changes have been made. If you are an FT.com subscriber, any changes to our terms and conditions will become effective from the date of your next payment following the change unless we notify you otherwise. If you are not an FT.com subscriber, any changes will become effective as soon as we post them on FT.com.

We may in exceptional circumstances cease to publish FT.com, the FT Content or cease to provide subscription services. We will give you at least 90 days’ notice of this, if possible. If we do so, then we will have no further obligation to you, unless you are a personal subscriber in which case we will offer you a refund of the unexpired period of your paid subscription. See [Section 5](#anchor-renewals-and-cancellations) for details.

[](#anchor-access-and-use)2\. Access and Use
--------------------------------------------

Our ability to invest in high quality journalism depends on our users complying with this [Section 2](#anchor-access-and-use). Please read our [Copyright Policy](https://help.ft.com/legal-privacy/copyright-policy/) that summarises how you are allowed to use FT Content and provides guidance on the types of use we do not permit without the purchase of additional licences from the FT. You agree that you will comply with our Copyright Policy.

Organisations that may be using FT Content without the appropriate permissions may approach us with a view to discussing the purchase of a licence to legitimise that use. See [http://ftcorporate.ft.com/](http://ftcorporate.ft.com/) for details.

The amount and types of FT Content that you can view, and the platforms on which you can view FT Content, depend on what type of user you are and what type of subscription (if any) you have. We can vary the access rights of registered users who are not accessing through a paid subscription at any time at our discretion.

For further access, we offer various types of individual and corporate subscriptions; see [Section 4](#anchor-personal-subscription-services) for details of individual subscriptions, and [http://ftcorporate.ft.com/](http://ftcorporate.ft.com/) for details of our corporate subscriptions. If you already have a subscription, details of your access rights can be found at [Your Account](https://registration.ft.com/youraccount/subscriptions).

3\. Privacy Policy and Registration
-----------------------------------

All information received by us from your use of FT.com will be used by FT in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://help.ft.com/legal-privacy/privacy-policy/). Please read this for details of how we may process your personal data.

On registration, you must provide FT with accurate, complete registration information and it is your responsibility to update and maintain changes to that information on the applicable FT.com registration or subscription pages. FT is entitled to rely on any information you provide to us.

Each registration is for a single user only. On registration, you will choose a user name and password (“ID”). The email address that you provide on registration must correspond to a named email account and not a generic or shared email account. You are not allowed to share your ID or give access to FT Content through your ID to anyone else. FT does not allow multiple users on a network or within an organisation to use the same ID. FT may cancel or suspend your access to FT.com if you share your ID without further obligation to you. You may not create additional registration or subscription accounts for the benefit of others or with the aim of avoiding our use of IDs to control access to and use of FT.com.

You are responsible for all use of FT.com made by you or anyone else using your ID and for preventing unauthorised use of your ID. If you believe there has been any breach of security such as the disclosure, theft or unauthorised use of your ID or any payment information, you must notify FT immediately by e-mailing us at [help@ft.com](mailto:help@ft.com). We recommend that you do not select an obvious user password (such as your name) and that you change it regularly.

If you provide FT with an email address that will result in any messages FT may send you being sent to you via a network or device operated or owned by a third party (e.g. your employer or colleague) then you promise that you are entitled to receive those messages. You also agree that FT may stop sending messages to you without notifying you.

If you are a registered user of or subscriber to FT.com then you may choose to use FT.com’s “Remember me” login feature that enables you to be logged in automatically to FT.com whenever you visit FT.com without having to manually log in each time. We recommend that you do not enable this feature on any computer that is or may be used by anyone other than you in order to prevent unauthorised access by third parties to both your subscription details and features of FT.com personal to you.

4\. Personal Subscription Services and Temporary Access Passes
--------------------------------------------------------------

We offer subscription services through FT.com and recommend that you read our Frequently Asked Questions for more details and before purchasing a subscription.

**Types of subscription:** Unless you purchase a subscription to use FT.com then your usage rights will be limited as set out at [www.ft.com/psp](https://www.ft.com/psp). We offer various types of subscription: the options currently available are set out at [www.ft.com/psp](https://www.ft.com/psp).

In certain countries we also offer what we call a “Bundled Subscription” which allows you to purchase an FT.com subscription together with a subscription to buy the Financial Times newspaper.

FT reserves the right to vary the amount of content and types of service that it makes available to different categories of user. If you are an FT.com subscriber, any significant reduction in the scope of your subscription will take effect only after we have given you at least 30 days’ notice, and will apply from the date of your next payment following that 30-day period. This does not apply where a type of content or service intended for Premium subscriptions is made available to Standard subscribers on an introductory, temporary or trial basis.

**Contract formation:** FT will try to process your subscription promptly but does not guarantee that your subscription will be activated by any specified time. By submitting your payment and other subscription details, you are making an offer to us to buy a subscription. Your offer will only be accepted by us and a contract formed when we have successfully verified your payment details and email address, at which point we will provide you with access to your subscription. FT reserves the right to reject any offer in its discretion, for any or no reason.

**Payment details:** When you purchase a subscription, you must provide us with complete and accurate payment information. By submitting payment details you promise that you are entitled to purchase a subscription using those payment details. If we do not receive payment authorisation or any authorisation is subsequently cancelled, we may immediately terminate or suspend your access to your subscription. In suspicious circumstances we may contact the issuing bank/payment provider and/or law enforcement authorities or other appropriate third parties. If you are entitled to a refund under these terms and conditions we will credit that refund to the card or other payment method you used to submit payment, unless it has expired in which case we will contact you.

**Pricing:** The subscription price will be made clear to you on our sign-up pages or otherwise during the sign-up process and may vary from time to time or by country. You agree to pay the fees at the rates notified to you at the time you purchase your subscription. For certain subscriptions you can take out either an annual or monthly (or other frequency we offer) subscription. Other subscription services may only require a one-off payment. You can also take out any other fixed term or payment frequency that we may offer from time to time. The currency in which your subscription is payable will be specified during the order process, depending on the service and your country of residence. Eligibility for any discounts is ascertained at the time you subscribe and cannot be changed during the term of your subscription. We will always tell you in advance of any increase in the price of your subscription and offer you an opportunity to cancel it if you do not wish to pay the new price.

**Trial subscriptions:** Where we provide a trial subscription, we will inform you of the full subscription price that is payable after the trial period. After the trial, your subscription will renew automatically at the full subscription price unless you cancel your subscription before the end of the trial. To cancel your subscription during the trial please go to [Manage Your Account](https://registration.ft.com/youraccount/details/core/view?execution=e2s1) and follow the simple cancellation instructions.

Please note that no more than one trial subscription per subscriber is allowed in any twelve month period. We reserve the right to cancel any trial subscription immediately, without refund, if we become aware that the subscriber has already had another trial subscription in the previous twelve months.

**Taxes:** Financial Times Limited (FT) is registered for VAT in a number of European Union (EU) countries. We also have some non-EU indirect tax registrations. Our UK VAT registration number is GB226162332. If you want any of our other tax ID numbers please contact [Customer Care](https://help.ft.com/contact/).

Unless otherwise indicated, prices stated on our website are inclusive of any applicable value added tax (VAT) or other sales taxes. The breakdown of any applicable VAT payable with your order is indicated on the invoice you will receive with your purchase.

If you are based in the EU outside the UK, please click here for important information on how VAT is included in our prices.

**Pricing errors:** If we incorrectly state a price to you whether online or otherwise, we are not obliged to provide you with a subscription at that price, even if we have mistakenly accepted your offer to buy a subscription at that price, and we reserve the right to subsequently notify you of any pricing error. If we do this, you may cancel the subscription without any obligation to us and we will refund you any money you have paid us in full, or you may pay the correct price. If you refuse to exercise either of these choices then we may cancel your subscription and will refund you any money you have paid us in full. We will always act in good faith in determining whether a genuine pricing error has occurred.

**Other costs:** In addition to the subscription fee you are charged, certain banks and credit card issuers will charge a foreign transaction fee on transactions which take place abroad or in a foreign currency. The majority of payments for subscriptions we take by card are processed in the United Kingdom therefore please check with your bank or credit card issuer to find out if such charges will be applied to you; the FT is not responsible for any such charges. You are also responsible for paying any internet connection or telecommunications charges that you may incur by accessing FT.com or using the services available on it. For example, if you use any of our mobile services then your network operator may charge you for data or messaging services.

**Moving house:** If you have a bundled subscription and are moving house, then we will transfer your newspaper delivery to your new address. However, if we are unable to provide you with a home delivery service to your new address, we will provide you with a pro rata refund for the newspaper element of your subscription, which means that we will refund part of your subscription fee for the unexpired period of the subscription.

**Newspaper delivery:** FT will aim to commence delivery of the Financial Times newspaper to you within 2 business days (UK), 7-10 business days (Eurozone) or 10-12 business days (United States) of your subscription commencing, delivery times for other regions will be confirmed to you separately. Once delivery has commenced, the Financial Times newspaper will be delivered Monday through to Saturday at the one delivery address specified when your order was confirmed.

5\. Renewal and Cancellation of Personal Subscriptions
------------------------------------------------------

**Renewals: If you chose to pay monthly**, your subscription will continue until you tell us that you no longer wish to receive it, in which case you will stop paying the monthly fees. We will notify you at least 14 days in advance of any changes to the price in your subscription that will apply upon next monthly renewal. Please see the “How to cancel” section below for details of how to cancel your monthly subscription. **If you chose to pay annually**, at least 14 days before each renewal you will be sent a reminder notice stating the rate that will apply for the renewal period. Unless you notify us before the end of your annual subscription period that you no longer wish to receive it, your annual subscription will renew for another year. We will charge the subscription using the same card or other payment method that you previously used.  For voucher pack subscribers, if you choose to cancel we reserve the right to charge you the subscription fee for the renewal period if we have sent you voucher packs that have not been returned before your subscription start date. We will provide you with a refund of the subscription fee on receipt of the complete returned voucher pack.

**Initial cancellation period**: Depending on the type of subscription you have, you may have a right to cancel your subscription within a limited period after placing your order, as follows.

Online-only subscriptions: If your subscription does not include newspaper deliveries, then by placing your order you agree that we may start your subscription immediately upon our accepting your order. This means that you are not entitled to a refund if you change your mind after we have provided you with access to your subscription.

Newspaper or bundled subscriptions: If your subscription includes newspaper deliveries (with or without any digital access), then you have the right to cancel your subscription, without giving any reason, within a **14 day** period from the day on which you receive the first newspaper forming part of your subscription. If you exercise your right to cancel within that period, then we will reimburse all payments received from you, less a pro-rated amount for each newspaper you received before cancelling. You do not need to return any of the newspapers to us. For more details (including an optional cancellation form), see our [cancellation information](https://help.ft.com/faq/changing-your-subscription/what-are-my-cancellation-rights/).

**Subsequent cancellation of your subscription**: Except as set out in the previous section, you do not have any right to cancel your subscription or any part of it until the end of your then current subscription period. Although you may notify us of your intention to cancel at any time, such notice will only take effect at the end of your then current subscription period, and you will not receive a refund (except in the limited circumstances set out in these terms). For voucher pack subscribers, you must return any voucher packs we have sent you that relate to further subscription periods by post to the address printed on the back of the voucher pack.

**How to cancel:** You may notify us of your wish to cancel your subscription by contacting our Customer Care team. [Chat with us online, call us on your regional telephone number](https://help.ft.com/contact/), or email us at [help@ft.com](mailto:help@ft.com) with the following: “I/We hereby give notice that I/we cancel my/our subscription”. Please then include:

*   The Account email address or Account Number (Customer Reference Number)
*   The billing address or delivery address (Including zip code/postcode)
*   Your contact telephone number

You may also use your [regional telephone number](https://help.ft.com/contact/) to temporarily suspend your newspaper delivery if you have an FT Bundled subscription, for example if you are going on holiday, although you must provide at least 5 business days' advance notice for this to be implemented.

**Cancellations by us:** FT reserves the right to suspend or terminate your subscription if you breach these terms and conditions, with or without notice and without further obligation to you. We may also suspend or terminate your subscription if we are prevented from providing services to you by circumstances beyond our control. If we terminate your subscription for any reason and/or permanently cease publishing FT.com, the FT Content or cease to provide subscription services then, unless there are exceptional circumstances, we will provide you with a pro rata refund to your credit card. This means that we will refund you with any amounts that you have paid us in advance that relate to any remaining and unexpired period of your subscription.

FT reserves the right to suspend or terminate your subscription without refund in the event of any verbal or written abuse of any kind (including abusive, offensive or aggressive language) directed towards our Customer Care team or other FT personnel.

**Cancellation of your registration:** If you are a registered user, but not a subscriber, then FT reserves the right to suspend or terminate your registration at any time, with or without notice and without further obligation to you. If you would like to cancel your registration then please contact our Customer Care team at [help@ft.com](mailto:help@ft.com) or using the telephone numbers set out above.
