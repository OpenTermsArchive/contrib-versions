**TikTok Web Cookies Policy**
=============================

_Last updated: 3 August 2020_

  

This Cookies Policy applies whenever you visit a website on the [tiktok.com](http://tiktok.com/) domain, unless expressly stated otherwise (collectively, the â€œWebsitesâ€� and each a â€œWebsiteâ€�). Other than the Websites, this Cookies Policy does not apply to any of our services, applications, products and content, which are each subject to their own, separate, notices.

On the Websites, we use cookies and other tracking technologies such as software development kits (SDKs), pixels and local storage. These technologies allow us to store information or gain access to information stored on your device to enable certain features and distinguish you from other visitors. Tracking technologies are used by most website providers to let users navigate between pages efficiently, ensure web security, understand how their websites are used, remember user preferences and generally improve the user experience.

**1\. What technologies are used?**
-----------------------------------

Cookies:  Cookies are small text files that enable us and our service providers to uniquely identify your browser or device for various purposes, including those described above. Cookies normally work by assigning a unique number to your device and are stored on your browser by the websites that you visit as well as third party service providers to those websites. 

Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. Some cookies are "session cookies", meaning that they exist only while your browser is open and are deleted automatically once you close your browser. Session cookies cannot be used to track your browser or device from website to website.

Other cookies are "persistent cookies", meaning that they survive after your browser is closed. Most persistent cookies are set to automatically expire after a defined duration (for example, a few days, weeks or months). When you return to that website (or visit other websites that use the same cookies) the website provider or its service providers can recognise the persistent cookies they have set and recognise your browsing device. 

SDKs: SDKs are pieces of code that enable data to be collected about your device, network and interaction with a website. Like cookies, they generally operate by assigning your device a unique number.

Pixels (also called beacons or tags): Pixels are small 1 pixel x 1 pixel invisible image files that are embedded in certain website pages or emails.  They can be used to collect information about your visit to that website page or to record the fact you opened an email. 

When you open a website page or email with an embedded pixel, the page or email will automatically run simple code that downloads the 1x1 image file to your browser or device.  At the same time, the code also passes certain information about your device and your actions on the website, or the fact that you opened the email, to the website server.  Your interest in the website or email can then be logged and used for analytics or advertising purposes. 

Local storage: Local storage files are created by websites to store information locally on your device. They are very similar to cookies, but can have slightly different properties (for example, local storage can be used to store more information and can be stored in a different location on your device to cookies).  Local storage is normally used to speed up site functionality and remember your preferences.

**2\. Categories of tracking technologies**
-------------------------------------------

Tracking technologies can either be â€œFirst-partyâ€� or â€œThird-partyâ€�. First-party tracking technologies refers to tracking technologies that we set and use directly.

The types of tracking technologies used by us and our partners in connection with the Websites can be classified into one of four categories, namely (i) "Strictly necessary", (ii) "Functionality", (iii) "Analytics and performance" (iv) "Advertising and marketing".
