=============================

_Last updated: 20 January 2020_

  
This Cookies Policy applies to the [www.tiktok.com](http://www.tiktok.com/) website (the “Website”). Please note that separate policies apply to our other services, applications, products and content. On the Website, we use cookies and similar technologies and techniques such as SDKs - these are collectively referred to as “cookies”. 

Cookies make your interaction with the Website easy and helpful and allow us to store information or gain access to information stored on your device to distinguish you from other visitors. Cookies are used by most website providers to make their websites work effectively and provide information to the website providers about how the website is used.

**1\. What is a cookie?**
-------------------------

Cookies are small text files that uniquely identify your browser or device. The cookie is stored on your browser by website or apps that you visit. When you return to that website or app (or visit websites or apps that use the same cookies) the website or app provider is able to recognize the cookies and your browsing device. An SDK operates by giving a device a unique code. 

Cookies do many different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving the user experience. Cookies can tell us, for example, whether you have visited the Website before or whether you are a new visitor. 

For a more thorough explanation of what cookies are and how they work, please visit the [EU Guide to Cookies](http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/basics/legal/cookies/index_en.htm), [aboutcookies.org](http://aboutcookies.org/) or [allaboutcookies.org](http://allaboutcookies.org/).

Cookies can be “First-party” Cookies or “Third-party” Cookies. First-party cookies are served by us directly to your device. Third-party cookies are served by a third party on our behalf.

Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. Some cookies are "Session cookies", meaning that they exist only while your browser is open and are deleted automatically once you close your browser. Other cookies are "Persistent cookies", meaning that they survive for a period of time after your browser is closed. Most Persistent cookies are set so that they automatically expire after a defined duration.
