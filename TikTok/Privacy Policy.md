Privacy Policy

**_Last updated:_** _5 October 2021_

**Introduction**
----------------

TikTok is a platform for creating and sharing short-form videos (the “**Platform**”). This privacy policy ("**Privacy Policy**") applies to the personal information that TikTok processes in connection with the Platform and other TikTok-related applications, websites, products, and services that link to or reference this Privacy Policy (collectively, the "**Services**").

**Data Controller:** If you live in the [](https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/26000121) European Economic Area (“**EEA**”), the UK, or Switzerland, TikTok Technology Limited, an Irish company (“**TikTok Ireland**”), and TikTok Information Technologies UK Limited (“**TikTok UK**”), a UK company, ("**TikTok**," "**our**," "**we**," or "**us**") are the joint controllers of any information processed in connection with this Privacy Policy.

**What Information We Collect**
-------------------------------

We collect three categories of information: [Information You Provide](#info-you-provide), [Automatically Collected Information](#auto-collect-info), and [Information From Other Sources](#info-from-other). More detail about each of the categories is provided below.

### **Information You Provide**

*   **Profile Information.** We collect information that you provide when you set up your TikTok account, such as your date of birth, username, email address and/or telephone number, and password. You can add other information to your profile, such as a bio or a profile photo.

*   **User Content.** We collect the content you create or publish through the Platform, including photographs, videos, audio recordings, livestreams, and comments, and the associated metadata (such as when, where, and by who the content was created). We collect [User Content](#user-content) through pre-loading at the time of creation, import, or upload, regardless of whether you choose to save or upload that [User Content](#user-content), for example, to recommend music based on the video. We also collect content (such as text, images, and video) from your device's clipboard if you choose to copy and paste content to or from the Platform or share content between the Platform and a third party platform.

*   **Direct Messages.** When you communicate with others using direct messages, we collect the content of the message and the associated metadata (such as the time the message was sent, received and/or read, as well as the participants in the communication). We do this to block spam, detect crime, and to safeguard our users.

*   **Your Contacts.** When you choose to import your contacts, we will collect information from your device’s phone book or your social media contacts. We use this information to help you make connections on the Platform when you are using our “Find Friends” function and to suggest your account to others.

*   **Purchase Information.** We collect your payment card information or other third-party payment information (such as PayPal) where payment is required. We also collect your transaction and purchase history.

*   **Surveys and Promotions.** We collect information you provide if you choose to participate in one of our surveys, promotions, contests, or marketing campaigns or events.

*   **Information When You Contact Us**. When you contact us, we collect the information you send us, such as proof of identity or age, feedback about your use of our Services or information about possible violations of our [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-service?lang=en#terms-eea) (our “**Terms**”), [Community Guidelines](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=en) (our “**Guidelines**”), or other policies.

### **Automatically Collected Information**

*   **Technical Information.** We collect certain device and network connection information when you access any of our Services. This information includes your device model, operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, IP address, and system language. We also collect service-related, diagnostic, and performance information, including crash reports and performance logs. We automatically assign you a device ID and user ID when you use our Platform. Where you log-in from multiple devices, we use information such as your device ID and user ID to identify your activity across devices to give you a seamless log-in experience and for security purposes.

*   **Location.** We collect your approximate location based on your [Technical Information](#tech-info) (such as SIM card and IP address) to customise your experience and for diagnostics and troubleshooting. With your permission, we may also collect precise location information (such as GPS).

*   **Usage Information.** We collect information about how you engage with our Services, including information about the content you view, how long and how often you use our Services, how you engage with other users, your search history on the Platform, and your settings.

*   **Content Characteristics and Features.** We detect and collect characteristics and features about the video and audio recordings that are part of your [User Content](#user-content), for example, by identifying objects and scenery; the existence or location within an image of a face or other body parts; and the text of words spoken in your [User Content](#user-content). We do this, for example, for content moderation and to provide special effects (such as video filters and avatars) and captions.

*   **Inferred Information.** We infer your attributes (such as age-range and gender) and interests based on the information we have about you. We use inferences to, for example, keep our Platform safe, content moderation, and, where permitted, to serve you personalised ads based on your interests.

*   **Cookies.** We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to operate and provide our Services. For example, we use cookies to remember your language preferences, make sure you don’t see the same video more than once, and for security purposes. We also use these technologies for marketing purposes. To learn more about our use of cookies, please see our [Web Cookies Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/tiktok-website-cookies-policy?lang=en) and [Platform Cookies Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/cookie-policy). We will obtain your consent to our use of cookies where required by law.

### **Information From Other Sources**

*   **Advertising, Measurement and Data Partners.** Advertisers and measurement and data partners share information with us such as mobile identifiers for advertising, hashed email addresses, and event information about the actions you’ve taken on a website or app. Some of our advertisers and other partners enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our [TikTok Advertiser Tools](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=10000407) (such as TikTok Pixel).

*   **Third Party Platform Information.** If you choose to sign-up for TikTok using a third party platform (such as Facebook or Google), the third party platform will share information such as your email address, user ID, and public profile.

*   **Integration Partners.** When you interact with any third party service (such as third party apps, websites or products) that integrate [TikTok Developer Tools](https://developers.tiktok.com/), we will receive the information necessary to provide you with features like cross-service authentication or cross-posting. For example, this will happen if you log in to another service with your TikTok account or if you use the TikTok “share” button on a third party service to share content from the third party service to TikTok.

*   **Others.** Other users or individuals may provide us with information about you, including if you are featured or mentioned in another user’s content or direct messages, a complaint or feedback submitted by a third party, or if your contact information is provided to us by another user through our [“Find Friends”](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/followers-and-following/finding-friends-from-your-contacts) function.

**Our Legal Bases and How We Process Your Information**
-------------------------------------------------------

We may only use your information when we have a “legal basis” to do so. We use different legal bases depending on why we use your information (in other words, the “purpose” of our processing).

**Port your information:** You have the right to data portability in circumstances where we rely on contractual necessity and consent as our legal basis. This means that you have the right to receive your information in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and to share it with a third party. You can exercise your right of portability by choosing to ‘Download your data’ in your settings. Click [here](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/personalized-ads-and-data/requesting-your-data) for detailed instructions.

**Data Security and Retention**
-------------------------------

Security of your information is important to us. We maintain appropriate technical, administrative, and physical security measures that are designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, theft, disclosure, modification, or loss. We regularly review our security measures to consider available new technology and methods.

We retain information for as long as necessary to provide our Services and for the other purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We also retain information when necessary to comply with contractual and legal obligations, when we have a legitimate business interest to do so (such as improving and developing our Services, and enhancing the safety, security and stability of our Services), and for the exercise or defence of legal claims.

The retention periods will be different depending on the type of information and the purposes for which we use the information. For example, when we process your information to provide you with the Service, we keep this information for as long as you have a TikTok account. This information includes your [Profile Information](#profile-info), [User Content](#user-content), and [Direct Messages](#dm). If you infringe our Guidelines or Terms, we may remove your [Profile Information](#profile-info) and/or [User Content](#user-content) from public view immediately but keep your information as is necessary to process the infringement.
