**Introduction**
----------------

This privacy policy ("**Privacy Policy**") applies to the personal information that TikTok processes in connection with TikTok apps, websites, software and related services (the “**Platform**”), that link to or reference this Privacy Policy.

**Data Controller**: If you live in the European Economic Area (“**EEA**”), the United Kingdom (“**UK**”), or Switzerland, TikTok Technology Limited, an Irish company (“**TikTok Ireland**”), and TikTok Information Technologies UK Limited (“**TikTok UK**”), a UK company, ("**TikTok**," "**our**," "**we**," or "**us**") are the joint controllers of your information processed in connection with this Privacy Policy.

**What Information We Collect**
-------------------------------

We collect your information in three ways: [Information You Provide](#info-you-provide), [Automatically Collected Information](#auto-collect-info), and [Information From Other Sources](#info-from-other). More detail is provided below.

### **Information You Provide**

* **Account Information.** We collect information that you provide when you set up an account, such as your date of birth, username, email address and/or telephone number, and password. You can choose to add other information to your account, such as a bio or image.
* **User Content.** We collect the content you create, import, upload or publish through the Platform, such as photographs, videos, audio recordings, livestreams, comments, hashtags, feedback, reviews, and the associated metadata (such as when, where, and by whom the content was created). Even if you are not a user, information about you may appear in content created or published by users on the Platform. We collect [User Content](#user-content) through pre-loading at the time of creation, import, or upload, regardless of whether you choose to save or upload that [User Content](#user-content), for example, to recommend music based on the video. We also collect content (such as text, images, and video) from your device's clipboard if you choose to copy and paste content to or from the Platform or share content between it and a third party platform. In addition, we collect location information (such as tourist attractions, shops, or other points of interest) if you choose to add the location information to your [User Content](#user-content).
* **Messages.** We collect the content of the messages you send and receive on the Platform and the associated metadata (such as the time the message was sent, received or read, as well as the participants in the communication). We also collect the messages you send or receive through our chat functionality when using our shopping feature to communicate with sellers or using virtual assistants.
* **Your Contacts and Other Connections.** If you choose to sync your contacts, we will collect information from your device’s phone book such as names, phone numbers, and email addresses, and match that information to users of the Platform. If you choose to find other users through your social network contacts, we will collect your public profile information as well as names and profiles of your social network contacts. We also collect information about the accounts you follow and that follow you.
* **Purchase Information.** When you make a purchase, a payment, or other transaction on or through the Platform, including when you buy TikTok Coins or purchase products through our shopping features, we collect information about the transaction, such as payment card information, billing, delivery, and contact information, and products you purchased.
* **Surveys, Research, and Promotions.** We collect [Information You Provide](#info-you-provide) if you choose to participate in a survey, research, promotion, contest, marketing campaign, or event conducted or sponsored by us.
* **Information When You Contact Us.** When you contact us, we collect the information you send us, such as proof of identity or age, feedback or inquiries about your use of the Platform or information about possible violations of our [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-service) (our “**Terms**”), [Community Guidelines](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines) (our “**Guidelines**”), or other policies.
* **Information From Forms and Features You Use**. We collect the [Information You Provide](#info-you-provide) when you fill in a form on the Platform. You can let TikTok fill in forms automatically with your account info, like your addresses or payment info.

### **Automatically Collected Information**

* **Technical Information.** We collect certain device and network connection information when you access the Platform. This information includes your device model, operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, IP address, system language and device settings. We also collect service-related, diagnostic, performance information, including crash reports and performance logs. We automatically assign you a device ID and user ID. Where you log-in from multiple devices, we use information such as your device ID and user ID to identify your activity across devices to give you a seamless log-in experience and for security purposes.
* **Location Information.** We automatically collect information about your approximate location (e.g. country, state, or city) based on your [Technical Information](#tech-info) (such as SIM card and IP address). Also, where you enable location services for the TikTok app within your device settings, we collect approximate location information from your device. Click [here](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/account-privacy-settings/location-services-on-tiktok) to learn more about how we collect Location Information.
* **Usage Information.** We collect information about how you engage with the Platform, including information about how you interact with content and ads, the duration and frequency of your use, your engagement with other users, and your search history.
* **Content Characteristics and Features.** We detect and collect characteristics and features about the videos, images, and audio recordings that are part of your [User Content](#user-content), for example, by identifying objects and scenery, the existence or location within an image of a face or other body parts; and the text of words spoken in your [User Content](#user-content). We do this, for example, for content moderation and to provide special effects (such as video filters and avatars) and captions.
* **Inferred Information.** We infer your attributes (such as age-range and gender) and interests based on the information we have about you. We use inferences, for example, to keep the Platform safe (such as for content moderation), to show you relevant information, and, where permitted, to serve you personalised ads based on your interests.
* **Cookies.** We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to operate and provide the Platform. For example, we use cookies to remember your language preferences, make sure you don’t see the same video more than once, and for security purposes. We also use these technologies for marketing purposes. To learn more about our use of cookies, please see our [Cookie Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/global/tiktok-website-cookies-policy). We will obtain your consent to our use of cookies where required by law.

### **Information From Other Sources**

* **Advertising, Measurement and Other Partners.** Advertisers, measurement and other partners share information with us about you and the actions you have taken outside of the Platform, such as your activities on other websites and apps or in stores, including the products or services you purchased, online or in person. These partners also share information with us, such as mobile identifiers for advertising, hashed email addresses and phone numbers, and cookie identifiers, which we use to help match you and your actions outside of the Platform with your TikTok account. Some of our advertisers and other partners enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our [TikTok Advertiser Tools](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=10000407) (such as TikTok Pixel). These partners are required to have the necessary rights and permissions to share your information with us before doing so. We process certain information that we receive from these partners as a joint controller with them. [Learn more](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/policy/business-products-terms) about our arrangements with these partners.
* **Sellers, Payment and Transaction Fulfillment Providers.** We receive information about you from sellers as well as payment and transaction fulfillment providers, such as payment confirmation details, and information about the delivery of products you have purchased through our shopping features.
* **Third Party Platforms and Partners.** Third party platforms provide us with information (such as your email address, authentication ID, and public profile) when you choose to sign up for or log in to the Platform using sign-in features provided by those third parties. We may also receive contact information that you hold or is held about you when contact information is synced with our Platform by you or another user. When you interact with any third party service (such as third party apps, websites or products) that integrate [TikTok Developer Tools](https://developers.tiktok.com/), we will receive the information necessary to provide you with features like cross-service authentication or cross-posting. For example, this will happen if you log in to another platform with your TikTok account or if you use TikTok’s “share” button on a third party platform to share content from there to the Platform. We may also receive information from third party providers which we use for safety purposes, including to protect users on the Platform and for content moderation.
* **Additional Sources.** We may collect or receive information about you from organisations, businesses, people, and others, including, for example, publicly available sources, government authorities, professional organisations, and charity groups. We also collect information about you where you are included or mentioned in [User Content](#user-content), [Messages](#message), in a complaint, appeal, request or feedback submitted by a user or third party, or if your contact information is provided to us by a user.

**Your Rights and Choices**
---------------------------

You have rights and choices when it comes to your information. Some of these rights apply generally, while others will only apply in certain circumstances. Depending on the scenario, these rights may be subject to some limitations. TikTok Ireland will be responsible for responding to your request within the relevant periods provided by law. If necessary to resolve your request, TikTok Ireland will liaise with TikTok UK.

**Access your information.** You can ask us, free of charge, to confirm what information we process about you, to provide certain information about the processing, and for a copy of your information. In-app controls enable you to:

* access your information that is available to other users when you navigate to the "**me**" tab on your account.
* request a copy of your information by using the “**Download your data**” tool. Click [here](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/personalized-ads-and-data/requesting-your-data) for detailed instructions.

**Delete your information.** You can delete or ask us to delete your information. In-app controls enable you to:

* delete the content posted on your account, such as your [User Content](#user-content) and your [Account Information](#account-info).
* delete your full account. Click [here](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/deleting-an-account) for detailed instructions.
* request the deletion of a particular piece of content using the in-app reporting feature (more information is available [here](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/report-a-problem)).

**Rectify your information.** You can change or ask us to change or correct your information where that information is not accurate. You can change or correct much of your information through the in-app controls and settings (such as your [Account Information](#account-info) and video content).

**Port your information.** You have the right to data portability in circumstances where we rely on contractual necessity or consent as our legal basis. This means that you have the right to receive your information in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and to share it with a third party. You can exercise your right of portability by choosing to “**Download your data**” in your settings. Click [here](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/personalized-ads-and-data/requesting-your-data) for detailed instructions. You can also port your TikTok data through TikTok’s Data Portability API. Click [here](https://developers.tiktok.com/products/data-portability-api/) for further information.

**Object to the processing of your information**. You also have the [right to object](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/right-to-object?lang=en) to the processing of your information in certain circumstances. This right applies when we are performing a task in the public interest, pursuing our legitimate interests or those of a third party, or when your data is processed for the purpose of facilitating scientific or historical research in certain circumstances. In submitting an objection request, please provide all relevant information, including the processing activity you are objecting to, why you want to object and how the processing activity affects you, and any additional information that you think will help us review your request. We will stop the particular processing if we don't have compelling legitimate grounds to continue that processing or don’t need it for legal claims.

**Restrict the processing of your information**. You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your information where (a) you are challenging the accuracy of the information, (b) the information has been unlawfully processed, but you are opposing the deletion of that information, (c) where you need the information to be retained for the pursuit or defence of a legal claim, or (d) you have objected to processing and you are awaiting the outcome of that objection request.

To exercise any of the above rights, please contact us through our [webform](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/privacy). Before we can respond to a request to exercise one or more of the rights listed above, you may be required to verify your identity or your account details or provide additional information so that we can understand your request.

We encourage you to “[Contact us](#contact-us)” if you are not satisfied with how we have responded to any of your rights requests. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the Irish Data Protection Commission (TikTok Ireland’s lead supervisory authority) or with your local supervisory authority.

In addition to these rights, you can control privacy settings for your account. Click [here](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/account-privacy-settings) for more information.

**Your choice regarding the use of information across different services.**

_If you are a user in the EU, we offer you the choice of whether to combine and cross-use your TikTok activity data with our affiliated services, like TikTok Shop, where legally required. [Learn more](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/global/tiktok-shop-dma/en)_.

**Data Security and Retention**
-------------------------------

Security of your information is important to us. We maintain appropriate technical, administrative, and physical security measures that are designed to protect your information from unauthorised access, theft, disclosure, modification, or loss. We regularly review our security measures to consider available new technology and methods.

We retain information for as long as necessary to provide the Platform and for the other purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We also retain information when necessary to comply with contractual and legal obligations, when we have a legitimate business interest to do so (such as improving and developing the Platform, and enhancing its safety, security and stability), and for the exercise or defence of legal claims.

The retention periods will be different depending on the type of information and the purposes for which we use the information. For example, when we process your information to provide you with the Platform, we keep this information for as long as you have an account. This information includes your [Account Information](#account-info), [User Content](#user-content), and [Messages](#message). If you violate our Guidelines or Terms, we may remove [Information You Provide](#info-you-provide) including your [Account Information](#account-info) and/or [User Content](#user-content) from public view immediately but keep your information as is necessary to process the violation.

**Our Global Operations and Data Transfers**
--------------------------------------------

To support our global operations:

* We store the information described in the “[What Information We Collect](#info-collected)” section in servers located in the United States, Malaysia and Singapore.
* Certain entities in our Corporate Group, located outside your country of residence (see [here](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/eea/transferee-countries/en)), are given limited remote access to this information so they can provide certain functions, as described in the Our Corporate Group section in “[How We Share Your Information](#share-info)”. This access is limited, secure and only granted where necessary under strict security controls and authorisation approval protocols.
* We share “[What Information We Collect](#info-collected)” with service providers, partners and other third party entities, as described in “[How We Share Your Information](#share-info)”. These third parties can be located outside your country of residence.

These entities commit to processing information in compliance with applicable privacy laws and to implementing appropriate security measures to protect your information.

When we transfer your information outside of the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, we ensure it benefits from an adequate level of data protection by relying on:

* Adequacy decisions. These are decisions from the [European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en) under Article 45 GDPR (or equivalent decisions under other laws) where they recognise that a country offers an adequate level of data protection. We transfer your information as described in “[What Information We Collect](#info-collected)” to some countries with adequacy decisions, such as the countries listed [here](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/eea/transferee-countries/en); or
* Article 49. In the absence of an adequacy decision, We rely on Article 49 (1)(b) and (c) GDPR to transfer Purchase Information as described in “[What Information We Collect](#info-collected)” to sellers and transaction fulfilment providers in countries without an adequacy decision when necessary to provide shopping features to facilitate the purchase and delivery of products, goods and services, or to process your orders; or
* Standard contractual clauses. The European Commission has approved [contractual clauses](https://commission.europa.eu/document/download/e60b1cd4-d802-44d5-9cac-ddd3c943a5ef_en?filename=1_en_annexe_acte_autonome_cp_part1_v5_0.pdf) under Article 46 of the GDPR that allows companies in the EEA to transfer data outside the EEA. These (and their approved equivalent for the UK and Switzerland) are called standard contractual clauses. We rely on standard contractual clauses to transfer information as described in “[What Information We Collect](#info-collected)” to certain entities in our Corporate Group (as described [here](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/eea/transferee-countries/en)) and third parties in countries without an adequacy decision.

For a copy of these adequacy decisions or standard contractual clauses, please contact us via the details provided in the “[Contact us](#contact-us)” section below.
