**1\. The types of personal data we use**

We collect and use the following information about you:

**Your Profile Information**

You give us information when you register on the Platform, including your username, date of birth, email address and/or telephone number, information you disclose in your user profile and your photograph or profile video.

**User Content and Behavioural Information**

We process the content you generate and view on the Platform, including preferences you set (such as choice of language), photographs and videos you upload, comments and live-streams you make (“**User Content**”). We collect information through surveys, challenges and competitions in which you participate. We also collect information regarding your use of the Platform, e.g. how you engage with the Platform, including how often you use the Platform and how you interact with content we show you, the ads you view, videos you watch and problems encountered, the content you like, the content you save to “Favourites”, the words you search and the users you follow. 

We infer your interests, gender and age for the purpose of personalising content. We also infer the interests of our users to better optimise advertising across our Platform. If you have consented, we will use this information for the purpose of serving personalised advertising. 

We review User Content for content moderation purposes to enforce our community guidelines, comply with legal obligations, and prevent and respond to abuse, fraud, illegal activity and other potentially harmful content on the Platform. 

We also process information about your followers, the likes you receive and responses to content you upload, for the purposes of personalising your "For You" Feed, promoting your content to other users and exploring whether your profile presents opportunities for collaboration. 

Messages

Where local laws allow us to, we collect and process your messages, which includes scanning and analysing the information in those messages through the Platform’s messaging functionality. That information includes the content of the message and information about when the message has been sent, received and/or read, as well as the participants in the communication.

We do this to prevent and block spam, prevent and detect crime, safeguard children (where this is in the substantial public interest) or to protect the interests of our users and other people. 

Please also be aware that messages sent to other users of the Platform will be accessible by those users and that we are not responsible for how those users use or disclose them.

Pro Accounts 

You can upgrade your user account in the app to a "Pro Account". A Pro Account gives you access to additional features, such as aggregated statistics about your content. If you participate in the TikTok Creator Marketplace, you can use the Pro Account menu to access settings and manage requests relating to Marketplace functions. For this purpose, data is exchanged with the TikTok Creator Marketplace. 

**Information from Third Parties**

You may choose to share certain data with us from third parties or, through your use of the Platform, we may collect such third party data automatically. 

Business Partners

If you choose to register to use the Platform using your social media account details (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google), you will provide us or allow your social network to provide us with your username and public profile. We will likewise share certain information with the relevant social network such as your app ID, access token and the referring URL. For further information on sharing your Facebook contact list with us, please see [Find other users and invite your friends](https://mint.bytedance.net/tools/webposts/Legal/6745034005269186561/6834438526793156613#find-friends).

Advertisers and Measurement Partners

Where you have consented to personalised advertising, we will match your information e.g. your mobile advertising ID, where it is provided to us by advertisers and other partners, with your TikTok profile to serve you ads. We may also serve you ads based on the information we infer from the data these partners provide. You can opt out of this activity at any time via your app settings by going to 'Privacy and safety' and then to 'Personalization and data' and opting out of ‘Ads based on data received from partners’.

We use information provided by our measurement partners, to understand how you’ve interacted with our ad partners’ websites and better assess the effectiveness of the advertising on our Platform. 

For more information about how our measurement and analytics providers collect data from the Platform, please see our [Cookies Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/cookie-policy). 

**Technical Information we collect about you**

We collect certain information from you when you use the Platform including when you are using the app without an account. Such information includes your IP address, instance IDs (which allow us to determine which devices to deliver messages to), mobile carrier, time zone settings, identifier for advertising purposes and the version of the app you are using. We will also collect information regarding the device you are using to access the Platform such as the model of your device, the device system, network type, device ID, your screen resolution and operating system, audio settings and connected audio devices. Where you log-in from multiple devices, we will be able to use your profile information to identify your activity across devices.

**Location**

When you use the Platform on a mobile device, we will collect information about your location in order to customise your experience. We infer your approximate location based on your IP address. In certain jurisdictions, we may also collect Global Positioning System data.

**Information about your friends**

You can choose whether to find other users of the Platform using our “Find Friends” function and to invite your contacts to join you on the Platform. We will use the contact information you have for that person, such as from within your telephone's contact list or Facebook friends list, and give you the option to send them either an SMS, email or third party message (such as Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger or Twitter) inviting them to view your TikTok profile. 

We use your personal data to find matches based on your contact information and your address book. However, your contact information and your address book is private and will not be disclosed. We use a technical system to find matches without sending your own information or your address book to us in plain text. 

If you want to find other users through your Facebook contacts, you can grant us access to your Facebook contact list. We will then collect your public Facebook information as well as names and profiles of your Facebook contacts. We will match this to registered users and show you any matches so you can follow them. 

**In-app purchases** 

If you make in-app purchases, please review our [Virtual Items Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/virtual-items?lang=en). Your purchase will be made via your Apple iTunes or Google Play account. We do not collect any financial or billing information from you in relation to such a transaction. Please review the relevant app store's terms and notices to learn about how your data is used. We keep a record of the purchases you make, the time at which you make those purchases and the amount spent so that we can credit your account with the correct value in coins.

**Information you provide to us** 

We collect information you provide us in response to a survey. If you respond to a TikTok survey, your individual responses will be used for the purpose of the survey and will be shared with other organisations, as explained to you when you participate in a survey.

**2\. Cookies**

Cookies and similar technologies (e.g. pixels and ad tags) (collectively, “**Cookies**”) are small files which, when placed on your device, enable us to collect certain information, including personal data, from you in order to provide certain features and functionality. We and our service providers and business partners use Cookies to collect data and recognise you and your device(s) on the Platform and elsewhere across your different devices. We do this to better understand the effectiveness of the advertising on the Platform and to enhance your user experience. To learn more about cookies please see our [Cookies Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/eu/cookie-policy/). 

**3\. How we use your personal data**
-------------------------------------

We will use the information we collect about you based on the legal grounds described below.

In accordance with, and to perform our contract with you, we will use your information to:

*   provide the Platform and associated services;

*   notify you about changes to our service;

In accordance with our legitimate interests to provide an effective and dynamic Platform, we may use your information to:

*   ensure your safety and security, including reviewing User Content, messages and associated metadata for breaches of our [Community Guidelines](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=en) and our [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/new-terms-of-service?lang=en);

*   ensure content is presented in the most effective manner for you and your device;

*   understand how people use the Platform so that we can improve, promote and develop it; 

*   promote popular topics, hashtags and campaigns on the Platform;

Where we process your information to fulfill our legitimate interests, we conduct a balancing test to check that using personal data is really necessary for us to achieve our business purpose. When we carry out this balancing test we also take into account the privacy rights of our users and put in place appropriate safeguards to protect their personal data.

With your consent, we will use your information to provide you with personalised advertising. Please see the sections on [Advertisers](https://mint.bytedance.net/tools/webposts/Legal/6745034005269186561/6834438526793156613#ad-third-parties) in “Information from Third Parties” for more information. You can control your personalised advertising settings at any time via your app settings. Please go to 'Privacy and safety' and then 'Personalization and data' to manage and control your advertising preferences. If you do not consent to personalised advertising, you will still see non-personalised advertising on the Platform.

**Advertisers**

This is done to help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign by showing advertisers how many users of the Platform have viewed or clicked on an advertisement.

**7\. The security of your personal data**
------------------------------------------

We take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this policy. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, for example, by encryption, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted via the Platform, which means any transmission is at your own risk. 

We have appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk that may be posed to you and other users. We maintain these technical and organisational measures and will amend them from time to time to improve the overall security of our systems.

We will, from time to time, include links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any information to these websites. 

**8\. How long we keep your personal data**
-------------------------------------------

We retain your information for as long as it is necessary to provide you with the service so that we can fulfil our contractual obligations and exercise our rights in relation to the information involved. Where we do not need your information in order to provide the service to you, we retain it only for so long as we have a legitimate business purpose in keeping such data. 

If you ask us to delete your account it will first be placed into a deactivated state for 30 days (to allow you to request it to be reinstated), followed by the deletion of the account. We will also delete personal data that relates to the in-app messaging function within 30 days of you cancelling your user account. Please note that messages sent to other users of our service are stored on their devices and cannot be deleted by us. 

In each case, there are also occasions where we may need to keep your data for longer in accordance with our legal obligations or where it is necessary for legal claims.
