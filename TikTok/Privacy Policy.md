We collect your information in three ways: [Information You Provide](#info-you-provide), [Automatically Collected Information](#auto-collect-info), and [Information From Other Sources](#info-from-other). More detail is provided below.

### **Information You Provide**

Even if you are not a user, information about you may appear in content created or published by users on the Platform. We collect [User Content](#user-content) through pre-loading at the time of creation, import, or upload, regardless of whether you choose to save or upload that [User Content](#user-content), for example, to recommend music based on the video. We also collect content (such as text, images, and video) from your device's clipboard if you choose to copy and paste content to or from the Platform or share content between it and a third party platform. In addition, we collect location information (such as tourist attractions, shops, or other points of interest) if you choose to add the location information to your [User Content](#user-content).
* **Direct Messages.** If you communicate with others using direct messages, we collect the content of the message and the associated metadata (such as the time the message was sent, received and/or read, as well as the participants in the communication). We also collect the messages you send or receive through our chat functionality when communicating with merchants who sell goods to you, and your use of virtual assistants when purchasing items through the Platform. We do this to block spam, detect crime, and to safeguard our users.

If you choose to find other users through your social network contacts, we will collect your public profile information as well as names and profiles of your social network contacts.

We also collect service-related, diagnostic, and performance information, including crash reports and performance logs. We automatically assign you a device ID and user ID. Where you log-in from multiple devices, we use information such as your device ID and user ID to identify your activity across devices to give you a seamless log-in experience and for security purposes.
* **Location Information.** We automatically collect information about your approximate location (e.g. country, state, or city) based on your [Technical Information](#tech-info) (such as SIM card and IP address). Also, where you enable location services for the TikTok app within your device settings, we collect approximate location information from your device.

* **Content Characteristics and Features.** We detect and collect characteristics and features about the videos, images, and audio recordings that are part of your [User Content](#user-content), for example, by identifying objects and scenery, the existence or location within an image of a face or other body parts; and the text of words spoken in your [User Content](#user-content). We do this, for example, for content moderation and to provide special effects (such as video filters and avatars) and captions.

**Object to the processing of your information**. You also have the [right to object](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/right-to-object) to the processing of your information in certain circumstances. This right applies when we are performing a task in the public interest, pursuing our legitimate interests or those of a third party, or when your data is processed for the purpose of facilitating scientific or historical research in certain circumstances. In submitting an objection request, please provide all relevant information, including the processing activity you are objecting to, why you want to object and how the processing activity affects you, and any additional information that you think will help us review your request. We will stop the particular processing if we don't have compelling legitimate grounds to continue that processing or don’t need it for legal claims.

**Restrict the processing of your information**. You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your information where (a) you are challenging the accuracy of the information, (b) the information has been unlawfully processed, but you are opposing the deletion of that information, (c) where you need the information to be retained for the pursuit or defence of a legal claim, or (d) you have objected to processing and you are awaiting the outcome of that objection request.

**Data Security and Retention**
-------------------------------

Security of your information is important to us. We maintain appropriate technical, administrative, and physical security measures that are designed to protect your information from unauthorised access, theft, disclosure, modification, or loss. We regularly review our security measures to consider available new technology and methods.

We retain information for as long as necessary to provide the Platform and for the other purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We also retain information when necessary to comply with contractual and legal obligations, when we have a legitimate business interest to do so (such as improving and developing the Platform, and enhancing its safety, security and stability), and for the exercise or defence of legal claims.

The retention periods will be different depending on the type of information and the purposes for which we use the information. For example, when we process your information to provide you with the Platform, we keep this information for as long as you have an account. This information includes your [Profile Information](#profile-info), [User Content](#user-content), and [Direct Messages](#dm). If you violate our Guidelines or Terms, we may remove your [Profile Information](#profile-info) and/or [User Content](#user-content) from public view immediately but keep your information as is necessary to process the violation.

**Our Global Operations and Data Transfers**
--------------------------------------------

To support our global operations:

* We store the information described in the “[What Information We Collect](#info-collected)” section in servers located in the United States, Malaysia and Singapore.
* Certain entities in our Corporate Group, located outside your country of residence (see [here](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/transferee-countries-eea)), are given limited remote access to this information so they can provide certain functions, as described in the Our Corporate Group section in “[How We Share Your Information](#share-info)”. This access is limited, secure and only granted where necessary under strict security controls and authorisation approval protocols.
* We share “[What Information We Collect](#info-collected)” with service providers, partners and other third party entities, as described in “[How We Share Your Information](#share-info)”. These third parties can be located outside your country of residence.

These entities commit to processing information in compliance with applicable privacy laws and to implementing appropriate security measures to protect your information.

When we transfer your information outside of the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, we ensure it benefits from an adequate level of data protection by relying on:

* Adequacy decisions. These are decisions from the [European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en) under Article 45 GDPR (or equivalent decisions under other laws) where they recognise that a country offers an adequate level of data protection. We transfer your information as described in “[What Information We Collect](#info-collected)” to some countries with adequacy decisions, such as the countries listed [here](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/transferee-countries-eea); or
* Standard contractual clauses. The European Commission has approved contractual clauses under Article 46 of the GDPR that allows companies in the EEA to transfer data outside the EEA. These (and their approved equivalent for the UK and Switzerland) are called standard contractual clauses. We rely on standard contractual clauses to transfer information as described in “[What Information We Collect](#info-collected)” to certain entities in our Corporate Group (as described [here](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/transferee-countries-eea)) and third parties in countries without an adequacy decision.

For a copy of these adequacy decisions or standard contractual clauses, please contact us via the details provided in the “[Contact us](#contact-us)” section below.
