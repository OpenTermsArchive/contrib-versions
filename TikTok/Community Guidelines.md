### Community Guidelines

_Last Updated,_ August_, 2020_

TikTok's mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. We are building a global community where users can create and share authentically, discover the world around them, and connect with others across the globe. We are also committed to keeping this community safe. Our Community Guidelines reflect our values and define a common code of conduct on our platform. These guidelines also allow our community to help maintain a safe shared space.

TikTok is an inclusive platform built upon the foundation of creative expression. We encourage users to celebrate what makes them unique, while finding a community that does the same. We deeply value that our users come from a huge breadth of nationalities and cultures, and we take into account the cultural norms and local regulations of the countries we operate in.

Offering a safe and supportive environment is our top priority. We believe that feeling safe is essential to helping people feel comfortable with expressing themselves openly and creatively. We also aim to cultivate an environment for authentic interactions by keeping deceptive content and accounts off our platform.

Our values form the foundation of our Community Guidelines. We remove content including video, audio, image, and text that violates our Community Guidelines, and suspend or ban accounts involved in severe or repeated violations. Under certain circumstances, we will go one step further and report the accounts to relevant legal authorities to keep our community safe.

Our Community Guidelines apply to everyone, and to everything shared on TikTok. They provide general guidance on what is and what is not allowed on the platform. We also recognize that some content that would normally be removed per our guidelines could have value to the public. Therefore, we may allow exceptions under certain circumstances, as described in the sections below.

We update our Community Guidelines from time to time to evolve with community behavior, mitigate emerging risks, and keep TikTok a safe place for creativity and joy.
