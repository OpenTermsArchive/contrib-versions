Integrity and Authenticity
--------------------------

Released April 17, 2024

Effective May 17, 2024

We want you to feel confident that you can access information that is reliable, discover content that is original, and engage with people who are authentic. This is foundational to building a community of trust and accountability both on and off-platform.

### Misinformation

In a global community, it is natural for people to have different opinions, but we seek to operate on a shared set of facts and reality. **We do not allow misinformation that may cause significant harm to individuals or society, regardless of intent.** We rely on [independent fact-checking partners](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/safety-partners/?lang=en), guidance from public health authorities, and our database of previously fact-checked claims to help assess the accuracy of content.

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it contains misinformation that may cause moderate harm, such as certain health content, conspiracy theories, repurposed media, or misrepresented authoritative sources. To be cautious, unverified information about emergencies and content temporarily under review by fact-checkers is also ineligible for the FYF.

To help you manage your TikTok experience, we may apply warning labels to content that has been assessed by our fact-checking partners and cannot be verified as accurate. We may also send [prompts](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/new-prompts-to-help-people-consider-before-they-share) to reconsider sharing such content.

### Civic and Election Integrity

Elections are important events and are often the subject of intense discussion and analysis. We try to balance enabling these discussions, while also being a place that brings people together and does not cause division. **We do not allow [paid political promotion](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/growing-your-audience/government-politician-and-political-party-accounts), political advertising, or fundraising by politicians and political parties (for themselves or others).** Our [political advertising policy](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/tiktok-ads-policy-politics-religion-and-culture/?lang=en) includes both traditional paid advertisements and creators receiving compensation to support or oppose a candidate for office.

We want to enable the informed exchange of civic ideas in a way that fosters productive dialogue. **We do not allow misinformation or content about civic and electoral processes that may result in voter interference, disrupt the peaceful transfer of power, or lead to off-platform violence.**

Content may be ineligible for the FYF if it contains misinformation that can hinder the ability of a voter to make an informed decision. To be cautious, unverified claims about an election and content temporarily under review by fact-checkers may also be ineligible for the FYF.

To help you manage your TikTok experience, we may apply warning labels to content that has been assessed by our fact-checking partners and cannot be verified as accurate.

### Edited Media and AI-Generated Content (AIGC)

We welcome the creativity that new artificial intelligence (AI) and other digital technologies may unlock. However, AI and other digital editing technologies can make it difficult to tell the difference between fact and fiction, which may mislead individuals or harm society. **We require you to label AIGC or edited media that shows realistic-appearing scenes or people.** This can be done using the [AIGC label](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/creating-videos/ai-generated-content), or by adding a clear caption, watermark, or sticker of your own.

Even when appropriately labeled, AIGC or edited media may still be harmful. **We do not allow content that shares or shows fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts.** This includes being bullied, making an endorsement, or being endorsed.

We are committed to protecting people's privacy. **We do not allow content that contains the likeness of young people, or the likeness of adult private figures used without their permission.**

More information

**AI-generated content (AIGC)** is content, including images, video, or audio, that is created or modified by artificial intelligence (AI) technology or machine-learning processes. This content may include images of real people, and may show highly realistic-appearing scenes or use a particular artistic style, such as a painting, cartoons, or anime.

**Significantly edited content** is content that shows people doing something they did not do, saying something they did not say, or altering their appearance in a way that makes them difficult to recognize or identify. This includes applying certain face filters, or an animation of an individual.

**Misleading AIGC or edited media** is audio or visual content that has been edited, including by combining different clips together, to change the composition, sequencing, or timing in a way that alters the meaning of the content and could mislead viewers about the truth of real world events.

**Realistic-appearing scenes or people** is content that uses are scenes, using images, video, or audio, that would lead someone to believe that the person shown is real or the event took place in the real world, such as a scene that is shown in the style or quality of a photograph or video.

**Likeness** is a clear representation of an individual. It includes audio and visual representation, and may show their face, body, or their distinctive appearance, gestures, or mannerisms.

**Public figures** are adults (18 years and older) with a significant public role, such as a government official, politician, business leader, or celebrity. We do not identify people under the age of 18 as public figures.

**Private figures** are all people under the age of 18, and adults (18 years and older) who are not public figures.

REQUIRED DISCLOSURE (using the [AIGC label](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/creating-videos/ai-generated-content) or a clear caption, watermark, or sticker)

* Content that is either completely generated or significantly edited by AI and contains realistic-appearing scenes or people
* A disclosure is not required if it involves edits that do not change the core meaning of the content, such as minor retouching, changing background objects, or using TikTok Effects or filters

NOT ALLOWED

* Realistic-appearing people under the age of 18
* The likeness of adult private figures, if we become aware it was used without their permission
* Misleading AIGC or edited media that falsely shows:

* Content made to seem as if it comes from an authoritative source, such as a reputable news organization
* A crisis event, such as a conflict or natural disaster

* The likeness of a public figure in certain artistic or humorous settings, such as a celebrity doing a popular TikTok dance or a spoof about a politician

### Fake Engagement

Authentic engagement is central to the integrity of our platform and informs how we recommend content that you may find interesting. **We do not allow the trade or marketing of services that attempt to artificially increase engagement or deceive TikTok's recommendation system.** If we become aware of accounts or content with inauthentically inflated metrics, we will remove the associated fake followers or likes.

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it seeks to trick or manipulate others to increase gifts, followers, likes, views, or other engagement metrics.

More information

NOT ALLOWED

* Facilitating the trade or marketing of services that artificially increase engagement, such as selling followers or likes
* Providing instructions on how to artificially increase engagement on TikTok

FYF INELIGIBLE

* Content that tricks or manipulates others as a way to increase gifts, or engagement metrics, such as "like-for-like" promises or other false incentives for engaging with content

* * *

### Unoriginal Content

The creativity on TikTok is what makes it great, so you should only post your own work. **We do not allow content that violates someone else's intellectual property rights.** If we become aware of content that is a violation, we will remove it. Learn more about our [intellectual property (IP) policies](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/global/copyright-policy/en).

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it involves unoriginal or reproduced content that does not have any new or creative changes.

If you believe you have experienced an IP violation, you can file a [copyright report](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/Copyright) or a [trademark report](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/Trademark).

More information

**Intellectual property** refers to the ownership of something that you created, which includes copyright and trademarks.

**Copyrights** are legal rights related to original works of authorship, including music and videos. Copyrights protect the original expression of an idea (such as the specific way a video or music is expressed or created) but do not protect underlying ideas and facts.

**Trademarks** are words, symbols, slogans, designs, or a combination of these that identifies the source of a product or service and distinguishes it from other products or services.

NOT ALLOWED

* Low quality content, such as extremely short clips or exclusively-GIF based videos

* * *

### Spam and Deceptive Behavior

To build a trusted community online, it is important that the behaviors and identities on your accounts are authentic and truthful. **We do not allow account behavior that may spam or mislead our community.** This includes conducting covert influence operations, manipulating engagement signals to amplify the reach of certain content, and operating spam or impersonation accounts. Parody or fan-based accounts are allowed, as long as they are clearly disclosed in the _account_ name (note that this is different than the @username).

You can set up multiple accounts to create different channels for authentic creative expression, but not for deceptive purposes. **We do not allow the use of accounts to engage in platform manipulation.** This includes the use of automation to register or operate accounts in bulk, distribute high-volume commercial content, artificially increase engagement signals, and circumvent enforcement of our guidelines.

If any of your accounts have been banned, or restricted from using a feature, you must not set up a new account or use a different existing account to get around the ban or restriction.

If we determine you have engaged in any of these deceptive account behaviors, we will [ban the account](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?lang=en&cgversion=2024H1update), and may ban any alternative accounts being used or new accounts that are created.

More information

**Covert influence operations** (CIO) are coordinated, inauthentic behaviors where networks of accounts work together to mislead people or our systems and try to strategically influence public discussion. This may include attempting to undermine the results of an election, influencing parts of an armed conflict, or shaping public discussion of social issues. Learn more about [covert influence operations](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/countering-influence-operations/?lang=en).

* **Covert influence operations,** including:

* Registering and operating networks of inauthentic accounts
* Coordinating content or engagement activity to artificially promote certain narratives or trends

To be cautious, unverified information about emergencies and content temporarily under review by fact-checkers is also ineligible for the FYF.

To help you manage your TikTok experience, we may apply warning labels to content that has been assessed by our fact-checking partners and cannot be verified as accurate. We may also send [prompts](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/new-prompts-to-help-people-consider-before-they-share) to reconsider sharing such content.

### Edited Media and AI-Generated Content (AIGC)

We welcome the creativity that new artificial intelligence (AI) and other digital technologies may unlock. However, AI and other digital editing technologies can make it difficult to tell the difference between fact and fiction, which may mislead individuals or harm society. **We require you to label AIGC or edited media that shows realistic-appearing scenes or people.** This can be done using the [AIGC label](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/creating-videos/ai-generated-content), or by adding a clear caption, watermark, or sticker of your own.

Even when appropriately labeled, AIGC or edited media may still be harmful. **We do not allow content that shares or shows fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts.** This includes being bullied, making an endorsement, or being endorsed.

We are committed to protecting people's privacy. **We do not allow content that contains the likeness of young people, or the likeness of adult private figures used without their permission.**

More information

**AI-generated content (AIGC)** is content, including images, video, or audio, that is created or modified by artificial intelligence (AI) technology or machine-learning processes. This content may include images of real people, and may show highly realistic-appearing scenes or use a particular artistic style, such as a painting, cartoons, or anime.

**Significantly edited content** is content that shows people doing something they did not do, saying something they did not say, or altering their appearance in a way that makes them difficult to recognize or identify. This includes applying certain face filters, or an animation of an individual.

**Misleading AIGC or edited media** is audio or visual content that has been edited, including by combining different clips together, to change the composition, sequencing, or timing in a way that alters the meaning of the content and could mislead viewers about the truth of real world events.

**Realistic-appearing scenes or people** is content that uses are scenes, using images, video, or audio, that would lead someone to believe that the person shown is real or the event took place in the real world, such as a scene that is shown in the style or quality of a photograph or video.

**Likeness** is a clear representation of an individual. It includes audio and visual representation, and may show their face, body, or their distinctive appearance, gestures, or mannerisms.

**Public figures** are adults (18 years and older) with a significant public role, such as a government official, politician, business leader, or celebrity. We do not identify people under the age of 18 as public figures.

**Private figures** are all people under the age of 18, and adults (18 years and older) who are not public figures.

REQUIRED DISCLOSURE (using the [AIGC label](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/creating-videos/ai-generated-content) or a clear caption, watermark, or sticker)

* Content that is either completely generated or significantly edited by AI and contains realistic-appearing scenes or people

NOT ALLOWED

* The likeness of adult private figures, if we become aware it was used without their permission
* Misleading AIGC or edited media that falsely shows:

### Fake Engagement

Authentic engagement is central to the integrity of our platform and informs how we recommend content that you may find interesting. **We do not allow the trade or marketing of services that attempt to artificially increase engagement or deceive TikTok's recommendation system.** If we become aware of accounts or content with inauthentically inflated metrics, we will remove the associated fake followers or likes.

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it seeks to trick or manipulate others to increase gifts, followers, likes, views, or other engagement metrics.

### Unoriginal Content

The creativity on TikTok is what makes it great, so you should only post your own work. **We do not allow content that violates someone else's intellectual property rights.** If we become aware of content that is a violation, we will remove it. Learn more about our [intellectual property (IP) policies](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/global/copyright-policy/en).

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it involves unoriginal or reproduced content that does not have any new or creative changes.

If you believe you have experienced an IP violation, you can file a [copyright report](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/Copyright) or a [trademark report](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/Trademark).

More information

**Intellectual property** refers to the ownership of something that you created, which includes copyright and trademarks.

### Spam and Deceptive Behavior

To build a trusted community online, it is important that the behaviors and identities on your accounts are authentic and truthful. **We do not allow account behavior that may spam or mislead our community.** This includes conducting covert influence operations, manipulating engagement signals to amplify the reach of certain content, and operating spam or impersonation accounts. Parody or fan-based accounts are allowed, as long as they are clearly disclosed in the _account_ name (note that this is different than the @username).

You can set up multiple accounts to create different channels for authentic creative expression, but not for deceptive purposes. **We do not allow the use of accounts to engage in platform manipulation.** This includes the use of automation to register or operate accounts in bulk, distribute high-volume commercial content, artificially increase engagement signals, and circumvent enforcement of our guidelines.

If any of your accounts have been banned, or restricted from using a feature, you must not set up a new account or use a different existing account to get around the ban or restriction.

If we determine you have engaged in any of these deceptive account behaviors, we will [ban the account](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?lang=en&cgversion=2024H1update), and may ban any alternative accounts being used or new accounts that are created.

More information

**Covert influence operations** (CIO) are coordinated, inauthentic behaviors where networks of accounts work together to mislead people or our systems and try to strategically influence public discussion. This may include attempting to undermine the results of an election, influencing parts of an armed conflict, or shaping public discussion of social issues. Learn more about [covert influence operations](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/countering-influence-operations/?lang=en).

* **Covert influence operations,** including:

* Registering and operating networks of inauthentic accounts

### Civic and Election Integrity

Elections are important events and are often the subject of intense discussion and analysis.

### Edited Media and AI-Generated Content (AIGC)

We welcome the creativity that new artificial intelligence (AI) and other digital technologies may unlock. However, AI and other digital editing technologies can make it difficult to tell the difference between fact and fiction, which may mislead individuals or harm society. **We require you to label AIGC or edited media that shows realistic-appearing scenes or people.** This can be done using the [AIGC label](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/creating-videos/ai-generated-content), or by adding a clear caption, watermark, or sticker of your own.

Even when appropriately labeled, AIGC or edited media may still be harmful. **We do not allow content that shares or shows fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts.** This includes being bullied, making an endorsement, or being endorsed.

We are committed to protecting people's privacy. **We do not allow content that contains the likeness of young people, or the likeness of adult private figures used without their permission.**

More information

**AI-generated content (AIGC)** is content, including images, video, or audio, that is created or modified by artificial intelligence (AI) technology or machine-learning processes. This content may include images of real people, and may show highly realistic-appearing scenes or use a particular artistic style, such as a painting, cartoons, or anime.

**Significantly edited content** is content that shows people doing something they did not do, saying something they did not say, or altering their appearance in a way that makes them difficult to recognize or identify. This includes applying certain face filters, or an animation of an individual.

**Misleading AIGC or edited media** is audio or visual content that has been edited, including by combining different clips together, to change the composition, sequencing, or timing in a way that alters the meaning of the content and could mislead viewers about the truth of real world events.

**Realistic-appearing scenes or people** is content that uses are scenes, using images, video, or audio, that would lead someone to believe that the person shown is real or the event took place in the real world, such as a scene that is shown in the style or quality of a photograph or video.

**Likeness** is a clear representation of an individual. It includes audio and visual representation, and may show their face, body, or their distinctive appearance, gestures, or mannerisms.

**Public figures** are adults (18 years and older) with a significant public role, such as a government official, politician, business leader, or celebrity. We do not identify people under the age of 18 as public figures.

**Private figures** are all people under the age of 18, and adults (18 years and older) who are not public figures.

REQUIRED DISCLOSURE (using the [AIGC label](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/creating-videos/ai-generated-content) or a clear caption, watermark, or sticker)

* Content that is either completely generated or significantly edited by AI and contains realistic-appearing scenes or people

### Fake Engagement

Authentic engagement is central to the integrity of our platform and informs how we recommend content that you may find interesting. **We do not allow the trade or marketing of services that attempt to artificially increase engagement or deceive TikTok's recommendation system.** If we become aware of accounts or content with inauthentically inflated metrics, we will remove the associated fake followers or likes.

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it seeks to trick or manipulate others to increase gifts, followers, likes, views, or other engagement metrics.

### Unoriginal Content

The creativity on TikTok is what makes it great, so you should only post your own work. **We do not allow content that violates someone else's intellectual property rights.** If we become aware of content that is a violation, we will remove it. Learn more about our [intellectual property (IP) policies](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/global/copyright-policy/en).

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it involves unoriginal or reproduced content that does not have any new or creative changes.

If you believe you have experienced an IP violation, you can file a [copyright report](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/Copyright) or a [trademark report](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/Trademark).

More information

**Intellectual property** refers to the ownership of something that you created, which includes copyright and trademarks.

### Spam and Deceptive Behavior

To build a trusted community online, it is important that the behaviors and identities on your accounts are authentic and truthful. **We do not allow account behavior that may spam or mislead our community.** This includes conducting covert influence operations, manipulating engagement signals to amplify the reach of certain content, and operating spam or impersonation accounts. Parody or fan-based accounts are allowed, as long as they are clearly disclosed in the _account_ name (note that this is different than the @username).

You can set up multiple accounts to create different channels for authentic creative expression, but not for deceptive purposes. **We do not allow the use of accounts to engage in platform manipulation.** This includes the use of automation to register or operate accounts in bulk, distribute high-volume commercial content, artificially increase engagement signals, and circumvent enforcement of our guidelines.

If any of your accounts have been banned, or restricted from using a feature, you must not set up a new account or use a different existing account to get around the ban or restriction.

If we determine you have engaged in any of these deceptive account behaviors, we will [ban the account](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?lang=en&cgversion=2024H1update), and may ban any alternative accounts being used or new accounts that are created.

More information

**Covert influence operations** (CIO) are coordinated, inauthentic behaviors where networks of accounts work together to mislead people or our systems and try to strategically influence public discussion. This may include attempting to undermine the results of an election, influencing parts of an armed conflict, or shaping public discussion of social issues. Learn more about [covert influence operations](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/countering-influence-operations/?lang=en).

* **Covert influence operations,** including:

* Registering and operating networks of inauthentic accounts

### Civic and Election Integrity

Elections are important events and are often the subject of intense discussion and analysis. We try to balance enabling these discussions, while also being a place that brings people together and does not cause division. **We do not allow [paid political promotion](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/growing-your-audience/government-politician-and-political-party-accounts), political advertising, or fundraising by politicians and political parties (for themselves or others).** Our [political advertising policy](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/tiktok-ads-policy-politics-religion-and-culture/?lang=en) includes both traditional paid advertisements and creators receiving compensation to support or oppose a candidate for office.

We want to enable the informed exchange of civic ideas in a way that fosters productive dialogue. **We do not allow misinformation or content about civic and electoral processes that may result in voter interference, disrupt the peaceful transfer of power, or lead to off-platform violence.**

Content may be ineligible for the FYF if it contains misinformation that can hinder the ability of a voter to make an informed decision. To be cautious, unverified claims about an election and content temporarily under review by fact-checkers may also be ineligible for the FYF.

To help you manage your TikTok experience, we may apply warning labels to content that has been assessed by our fact-checking partners and cannot be verified as accurate. Learn more about our [election integrity](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/protecting-elections/?lang=en) work, and [Government, Politician and Political Party accounts](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/growing-your-audience/government-politician-and-political-party-accounts).

### Edited Media and AI-Generated Content (AIGC)

We welcome the creativity that new artificial intelligence (AI) and other digital technologies may unlock. However, AI and other digital editing technologies can make it difficult to tell the difference between fact and fiction, which may mislead individuals or harm society. **We require you to label AIGC or edited media that shows realistic-appearing scenes or people.** This can be done using the [AIGC label](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/creating-videos/ai-generated-content), or by adding a clear caption, watermark, or sticker of your own.

Even when appropriately labeled, AIGC or edited media may still be harmful. **We do not allow content that shares or shows fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts.** This includes being bullied, making an endorsement, or being endorsed.

We are committed to protecting people's privacy. **We do not allow content that contains the likeness of young people, or the likeness of adult private figures used without their permission.**

More information

**AI-generated content (AIGC)** is content, including images, video, or audio, that is created or modified by artificial intelligence (AI) technology or machine-learning processes. This content may include images of real people, and may show highly realistic-appearing scenes or use a particular artistic style, such as a painting, cartoons, or anime.

**Significantly edited content** is content that shows people doing something they did not do, saying something they did not say, or altering their appearance in a way that makes them difficult to recognize or identify. This includes applying certain face filters, or an animation of an individual.

**Misleading AIGC or edited media** is audio or visual content that has been edited, including by combining different clips together, to change the composition, sequencing, or timing in a way that alters the meaning of the content and could mislead viewers about the truth of real world events.

**Realistic-appearing scenes or people** is content that uses are scenes, using images, video, or audio, that would lead someone to believe that the person shown is real or the event took place in the real world, such as a scene that is shown in the style or quality of a photograph or video.

**Likeness** is a clear representation of an individual. It includes audio and visual representation, and may show their face, body, or their distinctive appearance, gestures, or mannerisms.

**Public figures** are adults (18 years and older) with a significant public role, such as a government official, politician, business leader, or celebrity. We do not identify people under the age of 18 as public figures.

**Private figures** are all people under the age of 18, and adults (18 years and older) who are not public figures.

REQUIRED DISCLOSURE (using the [AIGC label](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/creating-videos/ai-generated-content) or a clear caption, watermark, or sticker)

* Content that is either completely generated or significantly edited by AI and contains realistic-appearing scenes or people
* A disclosure is not required if it involves edits that do not change the core meaning of the content, such as minor retouching, changing background objects, or using TikTok Effects or filters

NOT ALLOWED

* Realistic-appearing people under the age of 18
* The likeness of adult private figures, if we become aware it was used without their permission
* Misleading AIGC or edited media that falsely shows:

### Fake Engagement

Authentic engagement is central to the integrity of our platform and informs how we recommend content that you may find interesting. **We do not allow the trade or marketing of services that attempt to artificially increase engagement or deceive TikTok's recommendation system.** If we become aware of accounts or content with inauthentically inflated metrics, we will remove the associated fake followers or likes.

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it seeks to trick or manipulate others to increase gifts, followers, likes, views, or other engagement metrics.

More information

NOT ALLOWED

* Facilitating the trade or marketing of services that artificially increase engagement, such as selling followers or likes
* Providing instructions on how to artificially increase engagement on TikTok

FYF INELIGIBLE

* * *

### Unoriginal Content

The creativity on TikTok is what makes it great, so you should only post your own work. **We do not allow content that violates someone else's intellectual property rights.** If we become aware of content that is a violation, we will remove it. Learn more about our [intellectual property (IP) policies](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/global/copyright-policy/en).

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it involves unoriginal or reproduced content that does not have any new or creative changes.

If you believe you have experienced an IP violation, you can file a [copyright report](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/Copyright) or a [trademark report](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/Trademark).

More information

**Intellectual property** refers to the ownership of something that you created, which includes copyright and trademarks.

### Spam and Deceptive Behavior

To build a trusted community online, it is important that the behaviors and identities on your accounts are authentic and truthful. **We do not allow account behavior that may spam or mislead our community.** This includes conducting covert influence operations, manipulating engagement signals to amplify the reach of certain content, and operating spam or impersonation accounts. Parody or fan-based accounts are allowed, as long as they are clearly disclosed in the _account_ name (note that this is different than the @username).

You can set up multiple accounts to create different channels for authentic creative expression, but not for deceptive purposes. **We do not allow the use of accounts to engage in platform manipulation.** This includes the use of automation to register or operate accounts in bulk, distribute high-volume commercial content, artificially increase engagement signals, and circumvent enforcement of our guidelines.

If any of your accounts have been banned, or restricted from using a feature, you must not set up a new account or use a different existing account to get around the ban or restriction.

If we determine you have engaged in any of these deceptive account behaviors, we will [ban the account](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?lang=en&cgversion=2024H1update), and may ban any alternative accounts being used or new accounts that are created.

More information

**Covert influence operations** (CIO) are coordinated, inauthentic behaviors where networks of accounts work together to mislead people or our systems and try to strategically influence public discussion. This may include attempting to undermine the results of an election, influencing parts of an armed conflict, or shaping public discussion of social issues. Learn more about [covert influence operations](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/countering-influence-operations/?lang=en).

* **Covert influence operations,** including:

* Registering and operating networks of inauthentic accounts

### Civic and Election Integrity

Elections are important events and are often the subject of intense discussion and analysis. We try to balance enabling these discussions, while also being a place that brings people together and does not cause division. **We do not allow [paid political promotion](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/growing-your-audience/government-politician-and-political-party-accounts), political advertising, or fundraising by politicians and political parties (for themselves or others).** Our [political advertising policy](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/tiktok-ads-policy-politics-religion-and-culture/?lang=en) includes both traditional paid advertisements and creators receiving compensation to support or oppose a candidate for office.

We want to enable the informed exchange of civic ideas in a way that fosters productive dialogue. **We do not allow misinformation or content about civic and electoral processes that may result in voter interference, disrupt the peaceful transfer of power, or lead to off-platform violence.**

Content may be ineligible for the FYF if it contains misinformation that can hinder the ability of a voter to make an informed decision. To be cautious, unverified claims about an election and content temporarily under review by fact-checkers may also be ineligible for the FYF.

To help you manage your TikTok experience, we may apply warning labels to content that has been assessed by our fact-checking partners and cannot be verified as accurate. Learn more about our [election integrity](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/protecting-elections/?lang=en) work, and [Government, Politician and Political Party accounts](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/growing-your-audience/government-politician-and-political-party-accounts).

### Edited Media and AI-Generated Content (AIGC)

We welcome the creativity that new artificial intelligence (AI) and other digital technologies may unlock. However, AI and other digital editing technologies can make it difficult to tell the difference between fact and fiction, which may mislead individuals or harm society. **We require you to label AIGC or edited media that shows realistic-appearing scenes or people.** This can be done using the [AIGC label](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/creating-videos/ai-generated-content), or by adding a clear caption, watermark, or sticker of your own.

Even when appropriately labeled, AIGC or edited media may still be harmful. **We do not allow content that shares or shows fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts.** This includes being bullied, making an endorsement, or being endorsed.

We are committed to protecting people's privacy. **We do not allow content that contains the likeness of young people, or the likeness of adult private figures used without their permission.**

More information

**AI-generated content (AIGC)** is content, including images, video, or audio, that is created or modified by artificial intelligence (AI) technology or machine-learning processes. This content may include images of real people, and may show highly realistic-appearing scenes or use a particular artistic style, such as a painting, cartoons, or anime.

**Significantly edited content** is content that shows people doing something they did not do, saying something they did not say, or altering their appearance in a way that makes them difficult to recognize or identify. This includes applying certain face filters, or an animation of an individual.

**Misleading AIGC or edited media** is audio or visual content that has been edited, including by combining different clips together, to change the composition, sequencing, or timing in a way that alters the meaning of the content and could mislead viewers about the truth of real world events.

**Realistic-appearing scenes or people** is content that uses are scenes, using images, video, or audio, that would lead someone to believe that the person shown is real or the event took place in the real world, such as a scene that is shown in the style or quality of a photograph or video.

**Likeness** is a clear representation of an individual. It includes audio and visual representation, and may show their face, body, or their distinctive appearance, gestures, or mannerisms.

**Public figures** are adults (18 years and older) with a significant public role, such as a government official, politician, business leader, or celebrity. We do not identify people under the age of 18 as public figures.

**Private figures** are all people under the age of 18, and adults (18 years and older) who are not public figures.

REQUIRED DISCLOSURE (using the [AIGC label](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/creating-videos/ai-generated-content) or a clear caption, watermark, or sticker)

* Content that is either completely generated or significantly edited by AI and contains realistic-appearing scenes or people
* A disclosure is not required if it involves edits that do not change the core meaning of the content, such as minor retouching, changing background objects, or using TikTok Effects or filters

NOT ALLOWED

* Realistic-appearing people under the age of 18
* The likeness of adult private figures, if we become aware it was used without their permission
* Misleading AIGC or edited media that falsely shows:

### Fake Engagement

Authentic engagement is central to the integrity of our platform and informs how we recommend content that you may find interesting. **We do not allow the trade or marketing of services that attempt to artificially increase engagement or deceive TikTok's recommendation system.** If we become aware of accounts or content with inauthentically inflated metrics, we will remove the associated fake followers or likes.

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it seeks to trick or manipulate others to increase gifts, followers, likes, views, or other engagement metrics.

More information

NOT ALLOWED

* Facilitating the trade or marketing of services that artificially increase engagement, such as selling followers or likes
* Providing instructions on how to artificially increase engagement on TikTok

FYF INELIGIBLE

* * *

### Unoriginal Content

The creativity on TikTok is what makes it great, so you should only post your own work. **We do not allow content that violates someone else's intellectual property rights.** If we become aware of content that is a violation, we will remove it. Learn more about our [intellectual property (IP) policies](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/global/copyright-policy/en).

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it involves unoriginal or reproduced content that does not have any new or creative changes.

If you believe you have experienced an IP violation, you can file a [copyright report](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/Copyright) or a [trademark report](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/Trademark).

More information

**Intellectual property** refers to the ownership of something that you created, which includes copyright and trademarks.

**Copyrights** are legal rights related to original works of authorship, including music and videos. Copyrights protect the original expression of an idea (such as the specific way a video or music is expressed or created) but do not protect underlying ideas and facts.

### Spam and Deceptive Behavior

To build a trusted community online, it is important that the behaviors and identities on your accounts are authentic and truthful. **We do not allow account behavior that may spam or mislead our community.** This includes conducting covert influence operations, manipulating engagement signals to amplify the reach of certain content, and operating spam or impersonation accounts. Parody or fan-based accounts are allowed, as long as they are clearly disclosed in the _account_ name (note that this is different than the @username).

You can set up multiple accounts to create different channels for authentic creative expression, but not for deceptive purposes. **We do not allow the use of accounts to engage in platform manipulation.** This includes the use of automation to register or operate accounts in bulk, distribute high-volume commercial content, artificially increase engagement signals, and circumvent enforcement of our guidelines.

If any of your accounts have been banned, or restricted from using a feature, you must not set up a new account or use a different existing account to get around the ban or restriction.

If we determine you have engaged in any of these deceptive account behaviors, we will [ban the account](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?lang=en&cgversion=2024H1update), and may ban any alternative accounts being used or new accounts that are created.

More information

**Covert influence operations** (CIO) are coordinated, inauthentic behaviors where networks of accounts work together to mislead people or our systems and try to strategically influence public discussion. This may include attempting to undermine the results of an election, influencing parts of an armed conflict, or shaping public discussion of social issues. Learn more about [covert influence operations](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/countering-influence-operations/?lang=en).

* **Covert influence operations,** including:

* Registering and operating networks of inauthentic accounts

### Civic and Election Integrity

Elections are important events and are often the subject of intense discussion and analysis. We try to balance enabling these discussions, while also being a place that brings people together and does not cause division. **We do not allow [paid political promotion](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/growing-your-audience/government-politician-and-political-party-accounts), political advertising, or fundraising by politicians and political parties (for themselves or others).** Our [political advertising policy](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/tiktok-ads-policy-politics-religion-and-culture/?lang=en) includes both traditional paid advertisements and creators receiving compensation to support or oppose a candidate for office.

We want to enable the informed exchange of civic ideas in a way that fosters productive dialogue. **We do not allow misinformation or content about civic and electoral processes that may result in voter interference, disrupt the peaceful transfer of power, or lead to off-platform violence.**

Content may be ineligible for the FYF if it contains misinformation that can hinder the ability of a voter to make an informed decision. To be cautious, unverified claims about an election and content temporarily under review by fact-checkers may also be ineligible for the FYF.

To help you manage your TikTok experience, we may apply warning labels to content that has been assessed by our fact-checking partners and cannot be verified as accurate. Learn more about our [election integrity](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/protecting-elections/?lang=en) work, and [Government, Politician and Political Party accounts](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/growing-your-audience/government-politician-and-political-party-accounts).

### Edited Media and AI-Generated Content (AIGC)

We welcome the creativity that new artificial intelligence (AI) and other digital technologies may unlock. However, AI and other digital editing technologies can make it difficult to tell the difference between fact and fiction, which may mislead individuals or harm society. **We require you to label AIGC or edited media that shows realistic-appearing scenes or people.** This can be done using the [AIGC label](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/creating-videos/ai-generated-content), or by adding a clear caption, watermark, or sticker of your own.

Even when appropriately labeled, AIGC or edited media may still be harmful. **We do not allow content that shares or shows fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts.** This includes being bullied, making an endorsement, or being endorsed.

We are committed to protecting people's privacy. **We do not allow content that contains the likeness of young people, or the likeness of adult private figures used without their permission.**

More information

**AI-generated content (AIGC)** is content, including images, video, or audio, that is created or modified by artificial intelligence (AI) technology or machine-learning processes. This content may include images of real people, and may show highly realistic-appearing scenes or use a particular artistic style, such as a painting, cartoons, or anime.

**Significantly edited content** is content that shows people doing something they did not do, saying something they did not say, or altering their appearance in a way that makes them difficult to recognize or identify. This includes applying certain face filters, or an animation of an individual.

**Misleading AIGC or edited media** is audio or visual content that has been edited, including by combining different clips together, to change the composition, sequencing, or timing in a way that alters the meaning of the content and could mislead viewers about the truth of real world events.

**Realistic-appearing scenes or people** is content that uses are scenes, using images, video, or audio, that would lead someone to believe that the person shown is real or the event took place in the real world, such as a scene that is shown in the style or quality of a photograph or video.

**Likeness** is a clear representation of an individual. It includes audio and visual representation, and may show their face, body, or their distinctive appearance, gestures, or mannerisms.

**Public figures** are adults (18 years and older) with a significant public role, such as a government official, politician, business leader, or celebrity. We do not identify people under the age of 18 as public figures.

**Private figures** are all people under the age of 18, and adults (18 years and older) who are not public figures.

REQUIRED DISCLOSURE (using the [AIGC label](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/creating-videos/ai-generated-content) or a clear caption, watermark, or sticker)

* Content that is either completely generated or significantly edited by AI and contains realistic-appearing scenes or people
* A disclosure is not required if it involves edits that do not change the core meaning of the content, such as minor retouching, changing background objects, or using TikTok Effects or filters

NOT ALLOWED

* Realistic-appearing people under the age of 18
* The likeness of adult private figures, if we become aware it was used without their permission
* Misleading AIGC or edited media that falsely shows:

### Fake Engagement

Authentic engagement is central to the integrity of our platform and informs how we recommend content that you may find interesting. **We do not allow the trade or marketing of services that attempt to artificially increase engagement or deceive TikTok's recommendation system.** If we become aware of accounts or content with inauthentically inflated metrics, we will remove the associated fake followers or likes.

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it seeks to trick or manipulate others to increase gifts, followers, likes, views, or other engagement metrics.

### Unoriginal Content

The creativity on TikTok is what makes it great, so you should only post your own work. **We do not allow content that violates someone else's intellectual property rights.** If we become aware of content that is a violation, we will remove it. Learn more about our [intellectual property (IP) policies](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/global/copyright-policy/en).

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it involves unoriginal or reproduced content that does not have any new or creative changes.

If you believe you have experienced an IP violation, you can file a [copyright report](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/Copyright) or a [trademark report](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/Trademark).

More information

**Intellectual property** refers to the ownership of something that you created, which includes copyright and trademarks.

### Spam and Deceptive Behavior

To build a trusted community online, it is important that the behaviors and identities on your accounts are authentic and truthful. **We do not allow account behavior that may spam or mislead our community.** This includes conducting covert influence operations, manipulating engagement signals to amplify the reach of certain content, and operating spam or impersonation accounts. Parody or fan-based accounts are allowed, as long as they are clearly disclosed in the _account_ name (note that this is different than the @username).

You can set up multiple accounts to create different channels for authentic creative expression, but not for deceptive purposes. **We do not allow the use of accounts to engage in platform manipulation.** This includes the use of automation to register or operate accounts in bulk, distribute high-volume commercial content, artificially increase engagement signals, and circumvent enforcement of our guidelines.

If any of your accounts have been banned, or restricted from using a feature, you must not set up a new account or use a different existing account to get around the ban or restriction.

If we determine you have engaged in any of these deceptive account behaviors, we will [ban the account](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?lang=en&cgversion=2024H1update), and may ban any alternative accounts being used or new accounts that are created.

More information

**Covert influence operations** (CIO) are coordinated, inauthentic behaviors where networks of accounts work together to mislead people or our systems and try to strategically influence public discussion. This may include attempting to undermine the results of an election, influencing parts of an armed conflict, or shaping public discussion of social issues. Learn more about [covert influence operations](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/countering-influence-operations/?lang=en).

* **Covert influence operations,** including:

* Registering and operating networks of inauthentic accounts

We want you to feel confident that you can access information that is reliable, discover content that is original, and engage with people who are authentic. This is foundational to building a community of trust and accountability both on and off-platform.

### Misinformation

In a global community, it is natural for people to have different opinions, but we seek to operate on a shared set of facts and reality. **We do not allow misinformation that may cause significant harm to individuals or society, regardless of intent.** We rely on [independent fact-checking partners](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/safety-partners/?lang=en), guidance from public health authorities, and our database of previously fact-checked claims to help assess the accuracy of content.
