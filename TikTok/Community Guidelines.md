Sensitive and Mature Themes
---------------------------

Released April 17, 2024

Effective May 17, 2024

TikTok provides content that ranges from very family friendly to more mature. Given the diversity of our global community, developmental and cultural considerations inform our approach to potentially sensitive and more mature content that may be considered offensive by some. To honor our principle of [respecting local context](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/community-principles?lang=en&cgversion=2024H1update) and not imposing the norms of one country on another, some of the applications of the guidelines in this section differ across regions.

### Sexual Activity and Services

TikTok is a place where you can come to discuss or learn about sexuality, sex, or reproductive health. We are mindful that certain content may not be suitable for young people, may be considered offensive by some, or may create the potential for exploitation. **We do not allow sexual activity or services.** This includes sex, sexual arousal, fetish and kink behavior, and seeking or offering sexual services. However, it does not include reproductive health and sex education content.

More information

**Fetish and kink behavior** includes BDSM (bondage, discipline, domination, submission, sadism, and masochism), and sexual behaviors with non-human objects or with specific body parts (such as a foot fetish).

**Reproductive health** means the physical, mental and social well-being in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and processes.

**Sex education** means a broad variety of topics related to sex, sexuality, sexual health, and relationships.

NOT ALLOWED

* Showing penetrative sex, non-penetrative sex, or oral sex
* Showing physical sexual arousal, including sexual stimulation and physical responses to sexual arousal
* Fetish or kink activity
* Sexual services, including offering or asking for sexual acts (solicitation), sexual chats, imagery, pornography, member exclusive content, and streaming of adult content through a webcam, such as stripping, nude modeling, and masturbation (sexcamming)
* Sexual chats, imagery, or pornography

ALLOWED

* Reproductive health and sex education content, such as the use of birth control and abortion discussed in a medical or scientific context related to procedures, surgeries, or examinations

* * *

### Nudity and Body Exposure

We celebrate all shapes and sizes and want you to feel comfortable in how you present yourself and your body. We understand societies approach body exposure and clothing differently, so we seek to reflect prevailing cultural practices. **We do not allow nudity.** This includes bare genitalia, buttocks, breasts of women and girls, and sheer clothing.

We want to provide young people with an experience that is developmentally suitable. **We** **do not allow semi-nudity or significant body exposure of young people.** Content is ineligible for the FYF if it shows body exposure of a young person that may present a risk of uninvited sexualization.

We also do not want to amplify content that may not be suitable for a wide audience. Content is restricted (18 years and older) and is ineligible for the FYF if it shows semi-nudity of an adult. We allow regional exceptions for body exposure in limited situations, such as cultural practices.

More information

**Nudity** means being unclothed and showing bare intimate body parts that prevailing cultural practices indicate should be fully covered. This includes bare breasts of women and girls, but not of men and boys (including those who are transgender or intersex), or people who are non-binary. We recognize that some individuals do not describe their gender in binary terms, and acknowledge the complexity of applying this policy. When reviewing such content, we look at how someone self-describes using first-party information and indicators, such as captions, hashtags, or bio, and then may also look at how the person presents.

**Intimate body parts** means genitalia, buttocks, and breasts (including nipple and areola).

**Semi-nudity** means being mostly unclothed and close to (but not actually) nude, such as implied nudity or wearing clothes that minimally cover intimate body parts.

**Significant body exposure** means being clothed but having partially uncovered intimate body parts or only wearing intimate clothing, such as underwear.

NOT ALLOWED

* Showing nudity of adults and young people, including photography and digitally created images, such as manga and anime _(learn more about CSAM in [Youth Exploitation](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/safety-civility?lang=en&cgversion=2024H1update#4))_
* Showing semi-nudity or significant body exposure of young people, such as extremely cropped shirts, or only wearing underwear or lingerie

RESTRICTED (18 years and older)

* Showing semi-nudity of adults, such as wearing only nipple covers or underwear that does not cover the majority of the buttocks

FYF INELIGIBLE

ALLOWED

* Showing full nudity of infants during childbirth
* Showing bare breasts of men and boys (including those who are transgender or intersex), infants and toddlers (under the age of 4), and people who are non-binary

* Scientific or medical contexts, such as breast reconstruction after a mastectomy

* Showing body exposure that appears in culturally expected contexts, such as someone wearing a swimsuit at a beach or festival, or an athlete wearing a sports bra

### Sexually Suggestive Content

We welcome you to creatively express yourself, celebrate your culture, or seek to entertain. We are mindful that certain behaviors related to sexual arousal or suggestiveness may be offensive to some people and may put young people at risk of exploitation. **We do not allow content by young people that intends to be sexually suggestive.** This includes intimate kissing, sexualized framing, or sexualized behavior. **We also do not allow sexually explicit language by anyone.** We do allow some artistic content with sexual references, such as song lyrics.

Content is restricted (18 years and older) and ineligible for the FYF if it shows intimate kissing, sexualized framing, or sexualized behavior by adults, or if it shows sex products.

More information

**Intent** is referenced to be clear that other people finding you sexually arousing is not against the rules. However, we also acknowledge that intent can be subjective. To help us understand it, we use objective indicators, including a bio, hashtags, captions (such as "do you like what you see"), or sounds (such as moaning). We also recognize that different regions have varying views on what is considered sexually suggestive, which also informs our assessment.

**Intimate body parts** means genitalia, buttocks, and breasts (including nipple and areola).

**Intimate kissing** means kissing that may indicate sexual arousal or the beginning of a sexual interaction.

**Sexualized framing** means content that intentionally emphasizes clothed intimate body parts through techniques, such as filming, editing, or positioning of the body in front of the camera.

**Sexualized behavior** means behavior that is intended to be sexually arousing, including performances or repetitive body movements emphasizing intimate body parts, and imitating sexual acts.

**Sex product** means an object or device that is designed to be used for sexual pleasure, such as a sex toy.

NOT ALLOWED

* Showing young people engaging in:

* Sexualized behavior, such as repetitive breast or buttocks shaking or pelvic thrusting, striptease, fondling clothed intimate body parts, or licking phallic-shaped objects while making sounds or facial expressions that imply sexual arousal

RESTRICTED (18 years and older)

* Showing adults engaging in intimate kissing, sexualized framing, or sexualized behavior

* * *

### Shocking and Graphic Content

Part of the joy of TikTok is coming across new and unexpected content. But the platform is not a place to intentionally shock, upset, or disgust others. We recognize this type of content may be triggering, cause psychological harm, or lead to extreme discomfort. **We do not allow gory, gruesome, disturbing, or extremely violent content.**

Content is restricted (18 years and older) and ineligible for the FYF if it shows human or animal blood, extreme physical fighting, or graphic footage of events that would otherwise violate our rules but are in the [public interest](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/enforcement?lang=en&cgversion=2024H1update#1) to view. Content is also ineligible for the FYF if it shows fictional graphic violence or potentially distressing or mildly graphic material.

To help you manage your TikTok experience, we apply an "opt-in" screen or warning information to some content, such as human or animal blood, wild animals attacking each other, professional fighting, or potentially distressing or mildly graphic material.

Sensitive and Mature Themes
---------------------------

Released April 17, 2024

Effective May 17, 2024

TikTok provides content that ranges from very family friendly to more mature. Given the diversity of our global community, developmental and cultural considerations inform our approach to potentially sensitive and more mature content that may be considered offensive by some. To honor our principle of [respecting local context](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/community-principles?lang=en&cgversion=2024H1update) and not imposing the norms of one country on another, some of the applications of the guidelines in this section differ across regions.

### Sexual Activity and Services

TikTok is a place where you can come to discuss or learn about sexuality, sex, or reproductive health. We are mindful that certain content may not be suitable for young people, may be considered offensive by some, or may create the potential for exploitation. **We do not allow sexual activity or services.** This includes sex, sexual arousal, fetish and kink behavior, and seeking or offering sexual services. However, it does not include reproductive health and sex education content.

More information

**Fetish and kink behavior** includes BDSM (bondage, discipline, domination, submission, sadism, and masochism), and sexual behaviors with non-human objects or with specific body parts (such as a foot fetish).

**Reproductive health** means the physical, mental and social well-being in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and processes.

**Sex education** means a broad variety of topics related to sex, sexuality, sexual health, and relationships.

NOT ALLOWED

* Showing penetrative sex, non-penetrative sex, or oral sex
* Showing physical sexual arousal, including sexual stimulation and physical responses to sexual arousal
* Fetish or kink activity
* Sexual services, including offering or asking for sexual acts (solicitation), sexual chats, imagery, pornography, member exclusive content, and streaming of adult content through a webcam, such as stripping, nude modeling, and masturbation (sexcamming)

### Nudity and Body Exposure

We celebrate all shapes and sizes and want you to feel comfortable in how you present yourself and your body. We understand societies approach body exposure and clothing differently, so we seek to reflect prevailing cultural practices. **We do not allow nudity.** This includes bare genitalia, buttocks, breasts of women and girls, and sheer clothing.

We want to provide young people with an experience that is developmentally suitable. **We** **do not allow semi-nudity or significant body exposure of young people.** Content is ineligible for the FYF if it shows body exposure of a young person that may present a risk of uninvited sexualization.

We also do not want to amplify content that may not be suitable for a wide audience. Content is restricted (18 years and older) and is ineligible for the FYF if it shows semi-nudity of an adult. We allow regional exceptions for body exposure in limited situations, such as cultural practices.

More information

**Nudity** means being unclothed and showing bare intimate body parts that prevailing cultural practices indicate should be fully covered. This includes bare breasts of women and girls, but not of men and boys (including those who are transgender or intersex), or people who are non-binary. We recognize that some individuals do not describe their gender in binary terms, and acknowledge the complexity of applying this policy. When reviewing such content, we look at how someone self-describes using first-party information and indicators, such as captions, hashtags, or bio, and then may also look at how the person presents.

**Intimate body parts** means genitalia, buttocks, and breasts (including nipple and areola).

**Semi-nudity** means being mostly unclothed and close to (but not actually) nude, such as implied nudity or wearing clothes that minimally cover intimate body parts.

**Significant body exposure** means being clothed but having partially uncovered intimate body parts or only wearing intimate clothing, such as underwear.

NOT ALLOWED

* Showing nudity of adults and young people, including photography and digitally created images, such as manga and anime _(learn more about CSAM in [Youth Exploitation](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/safety-civility?lang=en&cgversion=2024H1update#4))_

### Sexually Suggestive Content

We welcome you to creatively express yourself, celebrate your culture, or seek to entertain. We are mindful that certain behaviors related to sexual arousal or suggestiveness may be offensive to some people and may put young people at risk of exploitation. **We do not allow content by young people that intends to be sexually suggestive.** This includes intimate kissing, sexualized framing, or sexualized behavior. **We also do not allow sexually explicit language by anyone.** We do allow some artistic content with sexual references, such as song lyrics.

Content is restricted (18 years and older) and ineligible for the FYF if it shows intimate kissing, sexualized framing, or sexualized behavior by adults, or if it shows sex products.

More information

**Intent** is referenced to be clear that other people finding you sexually arousing is not against the rules. However, we also acknowledge that intent can be subjective. To help us understand it, we use objective indicators, including a bio, hashtags, captions (such as "do you like what you see"), or sounds (such as moaning). We also recognize that different regions have varying views on what is considered sexually suggestive, which also informs our assessment.

**Intimate body parts** means genitalia, buttocks, and breasts (including nipple and areola).

**Intimate kissing** means kissing that may indicate sexual arousal or the beginning of a sexual interaction.

**Sexualized framing** means content that intentionally emphasizes clothed intimate body parts through techniques, such as filming, editing, or positioning of the body in front of the camera.

**Sexualized behavior** means behavior that is intended to be sexually arousing, including performances or repetitive body movements emphasizing intimate body parts, and imitating sexual acts.

### Shocking and Graphic Content

Part of the joy of TikTok is coming across new and unexpected content. But the platform is not a place to intentionally shock, upset, or disgust others. We recognize this type of content may be triggering, cause psychological harm, or lead to extreme discomfort. **We do not allow gory, gruesome, disturbing, or extremely violent content.**

Content is restricted (18 years and older) and ineligible for the FYF if it shows human or animal blood, extreme physical fighting, or graphic footage of events that would otherwise violate our rules but are in the [public interest](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/enforcement?lang=en&cgversion=2024H1update#1) to view. Content is also ineligible for the FYF if it shows fictional graphic violence or potentially distressing or mildly graphic material.

To help you manage your TikTok experience, we apply an "opt-in" screen or warning information to some content, such as human or animal blood, wild animals attacking each other, professional fighting, or potentially distressing or mildly graphic material.

We recognize this type of content may be triggering, cause psychological harm, or lead to extreme discomfort. **We do not allow gory, gruesome, disturbing, or extremely violent content.**

Content is restricted (18 years and older) and ineligible for the FYF if it shows human or animal blood, extreme physical fighting, or graphic footage of events that would otherwise violate our rules but are in the [public interest](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/enforcement?lang=en&cgversion=2024H1update#1) to view. Content is also ineligible for the FYF if it shows fictional graphic violence or potentially distressing or mildly graphic material.

To help you manage your TikTok experience, we apply an "opt-in" screen or warning information to some content, such as human or animal blood, wild animals attacking each other, professional fighting, or potentially distressing or mildly graphic material.

Sensitive and Mature Themes
---------------------------

Released April 17, 2024

Effective May 17, 2024

TikTok provides content that ranges from very family friendly to more mature. Given the diversity of our global community, developmental and cultural considerations inform our approach to potentially sensitive and more mature content that may be considered offensive by some. To honor our principle of [respecting local context](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/community-principles?lang=en&cgversion=2024H1update) and not imposing the norms of one country on another, some of the applications of the guidelines in this section differ across regions.

### Sexual Activity and Services

TikTok is a place where you can come to discuss or learn about sexuality, sex, or reproductive health. We are mindful that certain content may not be suitable for young people, may be considered offensive by some, or may create the potential for exploitation. **We do not allow sexual activity or services.** This includes sex, sexual arousal, fetish and kink behavior, and seeking or offering sexual services. However, it does not include reproductive health and sex education content.

More information

**Fetish and kink behavior** includes BDSM (bondage, discipline, domination, submission, sadism, and masochism), and sexual behaviors with non-human objects or with specific body parts (such as a foot fetish).

**Reproductive health** means the physical, mental and social well-being in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and processes.

**Sex education** means a broad variety of topics related to sex, sexuality, sexual health, and relationships.

NOT ALLOWED

* Showing penetrative sex, non-penetrative sex, or oral sex
* Showing physical sexual arousal, including sexual stimulation and physical responses to sexual arousal

### Nudity and Body Exposure

We celebrate all shapes and sizes and want you to feel comfortable in how you present yourself and your body. We understand societies approach body exposure and clothing differently, so we seek to reflect prevailing cultural practices. **We do not allow nudity.** This includes bare genitalia, buttocks, breasts of women and girls, and sheer clothing.

We want to provide young people with an experience that is developmentally suitable. **We** **do not allow semi-nudity or significant body exposure of young people.** Content is ineligible for the FYF if it shows body exposure of a young person that may present a risk of uninvited sexualization.

We also do not want to amplify content that may not be suitable for a wide audience. Content is restricted (18 years and older) and is ineligible for the FYF if it shows semi-nudity of an adult. We allow regional exceptions for body exposure in limited situations, such as cultural practices.

More information

**Nudity** means being unclothed and showing bare intimate body parts that prevailing cultural practices indicate should be fully covered. This includes bare breasts of women and girls, but not of men and boys (including those who are transgender or intersex), or people who are non-binary. We recognize that some individuals do not describe their gender in binary terms, and acknowledge the complexity of applying this policy. When reviewing such content, we look at how someone self-describes using first-party information and indicators, such as captions, hashtags, or bio, and then may also look at how the person presents.

**Intimate body parts** means genitalia, buttocks, and breasts (including nipple and areola).

**Semi-nudity** means being mostly unclothed and close to (but not actually) nude, such as implied nudity or wearing clothes that minimally cover intimate body parts.

**Significant body exposure** means being clothed but having partially uncovered intimate body parts or only wearing intimate clothing, such as underwear.

NOT ALLOWED

### Sexually Suggestive Content

We welcome you to creatively express yourself, celebrate your culture, or seek to entertain. We are mindful that certain behaviors related to sexual arousal or suggestiveness may be offensive to some people and may put young people at risk of exploitation. **We do not allow content by young people that intends to be sexually suggestive.** This includes intimate kissing, sexualized framing, or sexualized behavior. **We also do not allow sexually explicit language by anyone.** We do allow some artistic content with sexual references, such as song lyrics.

Content is restricted (18 years and older) and ineligible for the FYF if it shows intimate kissing, sexualized framing, or sexualized behavior by adults, or if it shows sex products.

More information

**Intent** is referenced to be clear that other people finding you sexually arousing is not against the rules. However, we also acknowledge that intent can be subjective. To help us understand it, we use objective indicators, including a bio, hashtags, captions (such as "do you like what you see"), or sounds (such as moaning). We also recognize that different regions have varying views on what is considered sexually suggestive, which also informs our assessment.

**Intimate body parts** means genitalia, buttocks, and breasts (including nipple and areola).

**Intimate kissing** means kissing that may indicate sexual arousal or the beginning of a sexual interaction.

**Sexualized framing** means content that intentionally emphasizes clothed intimate body parts through techniques, such as filming, editing, or positioning of the body in front of the camera.

**Sexualized behavior** means behavior that is intended to be sexually arousing, including performances or repetitive body movements emphasizing intimate body parts, and imitating sexual acts.

### Shocking and Graphic Content

Part of the joy of TikTok is coming across new and unexpected content. But the platform is not a place to intentionally shock, upset, or disgust others.

Content is also ineligible for the FYF if it shows fictional graphic violence or potentially distressing or mildly graphic material.

To help you manage your TikTok experience, we apply an "opt-in" screen or warning information to some content, such as human or animal blood, wild animals attacking each other, professional fighting, or potentially distressing or mildly graphic material.

Sensitive and Mature Themes
---------------------------

Released April 17, 2024

Effective May 17, 2024

TikTok provides content that ranges from very family friendly to more mature. Given the diversity of our global community, developmental and cultural considerations inform our approach to potentially sensitive and more mature content that may be considered offensive by some. To honor our principle of [respecting local context](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/community-principles?lang=en&cgversion=2024H1update) and not imposing the norms of one country on another, some of the applications of the guidelines in this section differ across regions.

### Sexual Activity and Services

TikTok is a place where you can come to discuss or learn about sexuality, sex, or reproductive health. We are mindful that certain content may not be suitable for young people, may be considered offensive by some, or may create the potential for exploitation. **We do not allow sexual activity or services.** This includes sex, sexual arousal, fetish and kink behavior, and seeking or offering sexual services. However, it does not include reproductive health and sex education content.

More information

**Fetish and kink behavior** includes BDSM (bondage, discipline, domination, submission, sadism, and masochism), and sexual behaviors with non-human objects or with specific body parts (such as a foot fetish).

**Reproductive health** means the physical, mental and social well-being in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and processes.

**Sex education** means a broad variety of topics related to sex, sexuality, sexual health, and relationships.

NOT ALLOWED

* Showing penetrative sex, non-penetrative sex, or oral sex
* Showing physical sexual arousal, including sexual stimulation and physical responses to sexual arousal

### Nudity and Body Exposure

We celebrate all shapes and sizes and want you to feel comfortable in how you present yourself and your body. We understand societies approach body exposure and clothing differently, so we seek to reflect prevailing cultural practices. **We do not allow nudity.** This includes bare genitalia, buttocks, breasts of women and girls, and sheer clothing.

We want to provide young people with an experience that is developmentally suitable. **We** **do not allow semi-nudity or significant body exposure of young people.** Content is ineligible for the FYF if it shows body exposure of a young person that may present a risk of uninvited sexualization.

We also do not want to amplify content that may not be suitable for a wide audience. Content is restricted (18 years and older) and is ineligible for the FYF if it shows semi-nudity of an adult. We allow regional exceptions for body exposure in limited situations, such as cultural practices.

More information

**Nudity** means being unclothed and showing bare intimate body parts that prevailing cultural practices indicate should be fully covered. This includes bare breasts of women and girls, but not of men and boys (including those who are transgender or intersex), or people who are non-binary. We recognize that some individuals do not describe their gender in binary terms, and acknowledge the complexity of applying this policy. When reviewing such content, we look at how someone self-describes using first-party information and indicators, such as captions, hashtags, or bio, and then may also look at how the person presents.

**Intimate body parts** means genitalia, buttocks, and breasts (including nipple and areola).

**Semi-nudity** means being mostly unclothed and close to (but not actually) nude, such as implied nudity or wearing clothes that minimally cover intimate body parts.

### Sexually Suggestive Content

We welcome you to creatively express yourself, celebrate your culture, or seek to entertain. We are mindful that certain behaviors related to sexual arousal or suggestiveness may be offensive to some people and may put young people at risk of exploitation. **We do not allow content by young people that intends to be sexually suggestive.** This includes intimate kissing, sexualized framing, or sexualized behavior. **We also do not allow sexually explicit language by anyone.** We do allow some artistic content with sexual references, such as song lyrics.

Content is restricted (18 years and older) and ineligible for the FYF if it shows intimate kissing, sexualized framing, or sexualized behavior by adults, or if it shows sex products.

More information

**Intent** is referenced to be clear that other people finding you sexually arousing is not against the rules. However, we also acknowledge that intent can be subjective. To help us understand it, we use objective indicators, including a bio, hashtags, captions (such as "do you like what you see"), or sounds (such as moaning). We also recognize that different regions have varying views on what is considered sexually suggestive, which also informs our assessment.

**Intimate body parts** means genitalia, buttocks, and breasts (including nipple and areola).

**Intimate kissing** means kissing that may indicate sexual arousal or the beginning of a sexual interaction.

### Sexually Suggestive Content

We welcome you to creatively express yourself, celebrate your culture, or seek to entertain. We are mindful that certain behaviors related to sexual arousal or suggestiveness may be offensive to some people and may put young people at risk of exploitation. **We do not allow content by young people that intends to be sexually suggestive.** This includes intimate kissing, sexualized framing, or sexualized behavior. **We also do not allow sexually explicit language by anyone.** We do allow some artistic content with sexual references, such as song lyrics.

Content is restricted (18 years and older) and ineligible for the FYF if it shows intimate kissing, sexualized framing, or sexualized behavior by adults, or if it shows sex products.

More information

**Intent** is referenced to be clear that other people finding you sexually arousing is not against the rules. However, we also acknowledge that intent can be subjective. To help us understand it, we use objective indicators, including a bio, hashtags, captions (such as "do you like what you see"), or sounds (such as moaning). We also recognize that different regions have varying views on what is considered sexually suggestive, which also informs our assessment.

**Intimate body parts** means genitalia, buttocks, and breasts (including nipple and areola).

**Intimate kissing** means kissing that may indicate sexual arousal or the beginning of a sexual interaction.

**Sexualized framing** means content that intentionally emphasizes clothed intimate body parts through techniques, such as filming, editing, or positioning of the body in front of the camera.

**Sexualized behavior** means behavior that is intended to be sexually arousing, including performances or repetitive body movements emphasizing intimate body parts, and imitating sexual acts.

**Sex product** means an object or device that is designed to be used for sexual pleasure, such as a sex toy.

### Shocking and Graphic Content

Part of the joy of TikTok is coming across new and unexpected content. But the platform is not a place to intentionally shock, upset, or disgust others. We recognize this type of content may be triggering, cause psychological harm, or lead to extreme discomfort. **We do not allow gory, gruesome, disturbing, or extremely violent content.**

Content is restricted (18 years and older) and ineligible for the FYF if it shows human or animal blood, extreme physical fighting, or graphic footage of events that would otherwise violate our rules but are in the [public interest](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/enforcement?lang=en&cgversion=2024H1update#1) to view. Content is also ineligible for the FYF if it shows fictional graphic violence or potentially distressing or mildly graphic material.

To help you manage your TikTok experience, we apply an "opt-in" screen or warning information to some content, such as human or animal blood, wild animals attacking each other, professional fighting, or potentially distressing or mildly graphic material.
