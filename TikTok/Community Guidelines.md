Youth Safety and Well-Being
---------------------------

Released April 17, 2024

Effective May 17, 2024

We are deeply committed to TikTok being a safe and positive experience for people under the age of 18 (we refer to them as "youth" or "young people"). This starts by being old enough to use TikTok. **You must be 13 years and older to have an account.** There are additional age limitations based on local law in some regions.

In the United States, there is a separate [under-13 TikTok experience](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-for-younger-users) that offers additional safeguards, including restricting interactive features, content suitability assessments from [Common Sense Networks](https://www.sensical.tv/common-sense-networks/home), and a dedicated [Privacy Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/childrens-privacy-policy). If you create a new account in the United States with a birthdate that shows you are under the age of 13, you will automatically enter into this experience.

If we learn someone is below the minimum age to have an account on TikTok, we will ban that account. If you believe you were incorrectly banned, you can [appeal](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/underage-appeals-on-tiktok) the decision. Anyone can report accounts that they suspect are under the minimum age, either [in-app](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/report-a-problem/report-a-user) or [online](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/privacy).

We do not allow content that may put young people at risk of psychological, physical, or developmental harm. If we become aware an account holder has a [severe violation](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?lang=en&cgversion=2024H1update#1) or has committed a sexual offense against a young person, we will ban the account, as well as any other accounts belonging to that person. We report incidents of youth sexual abuse and exploitation to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children ([NCMEC](https://www.missingkids.org/HOME)). We also report to relevant law enforcement authorities when there is a specific, credible, and imminent threat to human life or serious physical injury.

To provide young people with an experience that is developmentally suitable and a safe space for self-exploration, we take several steps including:

* Setting minimum age requirements for access to [certain product features](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/account-privacy-settings/privacy-and-safety-settings-for-users-under-age-18), including being 16 years and older to have your content be eligible for the FYF
* Using restrictive [default privacy settings](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/account-privacy-settings/privacy-and-safety-settings-for-users-under-age-18)
* Developing content levels to restrict content that may not be suitable for people under the age of 18, and providing you with content filtering options

You can learn more about TikTok's tools, controls, and educational content on our [Youth Portal](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/youth-portal?lang=en) and in our [Guardian’s Guide](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/guardians-guide/?lang=en).

**Tobacco products** include vaping products, smokeless or combustible tobacco products, synthetic nicotine products, E-cigarettes, and other Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems.

**Regulated substances** include prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, compressed air canisters (whippets), and nitrite poppers.

This starts by being old enough to use TikTok. **You must be 13 years and older to have an account.** There are additional age limitations based on local law in some regions.

In the United States, there is a separate [under-13 TikTok experience](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-for-younger-users) that offers additional safeguards, including restricting interactive features, content suitability assessments from [Common Sense Networks](https://www.sensical.tv/common-sense-networks/home), and a dedicated [Privacy Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/childrens-privacy-policy). If you create a new account in the United States with a birthdate that shows you are under the age of 13, you will automatically enter into this experience.

If we learn someone is below the minimum age to have an account on TikTok, we will ban that account. If you believe you were incorrectly banned, you can [appeal](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/underage-appeals-on-tiktok) the decision. Anyone can report accounts that they suspect are under the minimum age, either [in-app](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/report-a-problem/report-a-user) or [online](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/privacy).

We do not allow content that may put young people at risk of psychological, physical, or developmental harm. If we become aware an account holder has a [severe violation](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?lang=en&cgversion=2024H1update#1) or has committed a sexual offense against a young person, we will ban the account, as well as any other accounts belonging to that person. We report incidents of youth sexual abuse and exploitation to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children ([NCMEC](https://www.missingkids.org/HOME)). We also report to relevant law enforcement authorities when there is a specific, credible, and imminent threat to human life or serious physical injury.

To provide young people with an experience that is developmentally suitable and a safe space for self-exploration, we take several steps including:

* Setting minimum age requirements for access to [certain product features](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/account-privacy-settings/privacy-and-safety-settings-for-users-under-age-18), including being 16 years and older to have your content be eligible for the FYF
* Using restrictive [default privacy settings](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/account-privacy-settings/privacy-and-safety-settings-for-users-under-age-18)
* Developing content levels to restrict content that may not be suitable for people under the age of 18, and providing you with content filtering options

If you create a new account in the United States with a birthdate that shows you are under the age of 13, you will automatically enter into this experience.

If we learn someone is below the minimum age to have an account on TikTok, we will ban that account. If you believe you were incorrectly banned, you can [appeal](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/underage-appeals-on-tiktok) the decision. Anyone can report accounts that they suspect are under the minimum age, either [in-app](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/report-a-problem/report-a-user) or [online](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/privacy).

We do not allow content that may put young people at risk of psychological, physical, or developmental harm. If we become aware an account holder has a [severe violation](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?lang=en&cgversion=2024H1update#1) or has committed a sexual offense against a young person, we will ban the account, as well as any other accounts belonging to that person. We report incidents of youth sexual abuse and exploitation to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children ([NCMEC](https://www.missingkids.org/HOME)). We also report to relevant law enforcement authorities when there is a specific, credible, and imminent threat to human life or serious physical injury.

To provide young people with an experience that is developmentally suitable and a safe space for self-exploration, we take several steps including:

* Setting minimum age requirements for access to [certain product features](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/account-privacy-settings/privacy-and-safety-settings-for-users-under-age-18), including being 16 years and older to have your content be eligible for the FYF
* Using restrictive [default privacy settings](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/account-privacy-settings/privacy-and-safety-settings-for-users-under-age-18)
* Developing content levels to restrict content that may not be suitable for people under the age of 18, and providing you with content filtering options

You can learn more about TikTok's tools, controls, and educational content on our [Youth Portal](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/youth-portal?lang=en) and in our [Guardian’s Guide](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/guardians-guide/?lang=en).
