### Community Guidelines

  

_We're updating our livestream policies. Starting on 23 November, 2022, you'll need to be at least 18 years old to host a livestream. You can find our new policies [here](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines-2022-update)._

Introduction
------------

_Last updated, February 2022_

TikTok's mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. We are building a global community where people can create and share, discover the world around them, and connect with others across the world. We are committed to maintaining a supportive environment for our growing community. Our Community Guidelines establish a set of norms and common code of conduct that provide for a safe and welcoming space for everyone.

At TikTok, we prioritize safety, diversity, inclusion, and authenticity. We encourage creators to celebrate what makes them unique and viewers to engage with what inspires them; we believe that a safe environment helps everyone do so openly.  We prize the global nature of our community and strive to take into account the breadth of cultural norms where we operate. We also aim to cultivate an environment for genuine interactions by encouraging authentic content on TikTok.

Our Community Guidelines apply to everyone and everything on TikTok. We proactively enforce them using a mix of technology and human moderation and aim to do so before people report potentially violative content to us. We also encourage our community members to use the [tools we provide on TikTok](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/report-a-problem) to report any content or account they believe violates our Community Guidelines.

We will remove any content – including video, audio, livestream, images, comments, links, or other text – that violates our Community Guidelines. Individuals are notified of our decisions and can appeal them if they believe no violation has occurred. We will temporarily or permanently ban accounts and/or users that are involved in severe or repeated on-platform violations; we may also consider actions on other platforms and offline behavior in these decisions. Circumstances that involve any instance of a threat of real-world harm to human life that is specific, credible, and imminent may be reported to law enforcement authorities. The full TikTok experience is for people 13 and older, and we actively remove accounts of people we suspect are under this age. (_In the US, we accommodate people under 13 in TikTok for Younger Users, a limited app experience designed specifically for this audience with additional safeguards and privacy protections._)

Our algorithms are designed with trust and safety in mind. For some content, we may reduce discoverability, including by redirecting search results, or making videos ineligible for recommendation in the For You feed. More information can be found below in the Ineligible for the For You feed section.

At the same time, we recognize that some content that would normally be removed per our Community Guidelines may be in the public interest. Therefore, we may allow exceptions under certain limited circumstances, such as educational, documentary, scientific, artistic, or satirical content, content in fictional or professional settings, counterspeech, or content that otherwise enables individual expression on topics of social importance. To minimize the potentially negative impact of graphic content, we may first include safety measures such as an “opt-in” screen or warning.

In consultation with relevant stakeholders, we update our Community Guidelines from time to time to evolve alongside new behaviors and risks, as part of our commitment to keeping TikTok a safe place for creativity and joy.

  

Minor safety
------------

We are deeply committed to protecting the safety of minors on our platform. TikTok defines a minor as any person under the age of 18. We prohibit activities that perpetuate the abuse, harm, endangerment, or exploitation of minors on TikTok. Any content, including animation or digitally created or manipulated media, that depicts abuse, exploitation, or endangerment of minors is a violation on our platform and will be removed when detected. We report child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and supporting evidence  to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) and to any additional relevant legal authorities.

Our users must meet the minimum age requirements to use TikTok, as stipulated in our [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-use). When an underage account is identified, we remove it. Given our platform is designed with the safety of minors in mind, some of our features are age restricted. Account holders who are under the age of 16 cannot use direct messaging or host a livestream and their content is not eligible to appear in the For You feed (the age thresholds may be higher in some regions). Account holders who are under the age of 18 cannot send or receive gifts via our virtual gifting features.

### Sexual exploitation of minors

TikTok will take action on any content or accounts involving CSAM or sexual exploitation of a minor. Sexual exploitation of minors includes any abuse of a position of power or trust for sexual purposes, including profiting financially, socially, sexually, or politically from the exploitation of a minor.

However, we do support members of our community sharing their personal experiences with these issues in a safe way to raise awareness and find community support. We also encourage individuals who are struggling with thoughts of suicide or self-harm, or who know someone is seriously considering suicide, to immediately contact local emergency services or a [suicide prevention](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/resources/suicide-hotline-resources?lang=en) [hotline](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/en/suicide-self-harm/). In the event that our intervention could help a user who may be at risk of harming themselves, TikTok may also alert local emergency services.

We also remove content that depicts attempted suicide or behavior likely to lead to self-inflicted death. We prohibit any form of content that promotes, normalizes, or glorifies suicide, provides instructions for suicide, or posts that portray a suicide as heroic or honorable. Circumstances that involve any instance of a threat of real-world harm to human life that is specific, credible, and imminent may be reported to law enforcement authorities.

Content that encourages or promotes suicide or self-harm hoaxes are also not allowed. This includes alarming warnings that could cause panic and widespread harm. We will remove such warnings, while allowing content that seeks to dispel panic and promote accurate information about such hoaxes.

### Abusive behavior

We remove expressions of abuse, including threats or degrading statements intended to mock, humiliate, embarrass, intimidate, or hurt an individual.

TikTok is a diverse and inclusive community that has no tolerance for discrimination.

We ban accounts and/or users that engage in severe or multiple hate speech violations or that are associated with hate speech off the TikTok platform.

Violent extremism

When there is a threat to public safety or an account is used to promote or glorify off-platform violence, we ban the account. When warranted, we will report threats to relevant legal authorities. To effectively protect our community, we may consider off-platform behavior to identify violent extremist organizations and individuals on our platform. If we find such organizations or individuals, we will ban their accounts.

### Threats and incitement to violence

We consider incitement to violence as advocating for, directing, or encouraging other people to commit violence. We do not allow threats of violence or incitement to violence on our platform that may result in serious physical harm.

Copyright and trademark infringement
------------------------------------

Copyright is a legal right that protects original works of authorship (e.g., music, videos) and original expression of an idea (e.g., the specific way a video or music is expressed or created), although it does not protect underlying ideas or facts. A trademark is a word, symbol, slogan, or design that identifies and distinguishes the source of a product or service. We encourage everyone to create and share original content. Content that infringes someone else's intellectual property rights is prohibited on our platform and will be removed if we become aware of it. The use of copyrighted work under certain circumstances, such as the fair use doctrine or other applicable laws, or the use of a trademark to reference, lawfully comment, criticize, parody, make a fan page, or review a product or service, may not be considered a violation of our policies.

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

* Content that violates or infringes someone else's copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights

  

Platform security
-----------------

A top priority for TikTok is the safety and security of our users, creators, business partners, vendors, and employee data, including their personal information, accounts, profiles, content, and other proprietary information, as well as our product and services. We do not allow access to the TikTok platform -- which includes our website, app, network, and associated infrastructure or networks -- through unauthorized methods, or to obtain sensitive confidential commercial or personal information. Any attempt to undermine or abuse the security, integrity or reliability of our platform, products, or services is expressly prohibited.

**Do not:**

* Attempt to access the TikTok platform in an unauthorized manner, and do not create fake or misleading versions of the TikTok platform
* Create or distribute malicious files, content, or messages that contain viruses, Trojan horses, worms, logic bombs, or other materials that may be harmful to the community or platform

* Leverage TikTok accounts under false or fraudulent pretenses to distribute spam, phishing, or smishing content in an attempt to perpetrate cybercrime or gain unauthorized access to others’ content, accounts, systems, or data

* Click on suspicious links or engage in requests for information about your TikTok account details, passwords, verification qualification, financial, or other personal information

  

Ineligible for the For You feed
-------------------------------

The goal of the For You feed (FYF) is to provide original content that honors our mission of inspiring creativity and bringing joy to our diverse community around the world. Each account holder’s FYF is [based on](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you) [a personalized recommendation system](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you)[.](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you) Our recommendation system is designed with user safety as a primary consideration, meaning that some content may not be eligible for recommendation. While the spontaneity of the FYF is what makes TikTok unique, the FYF is intended for a general audience that includes everyone from our teenage users to great grandparents. We consider the breadth of our audience when we determine what content is eligible for algorithmic promotion on the platform. Provided that it does not violate local laws, the following types of content may be allowed on our platform, searchable, and viewed in Following feeds but not eligible for recommendation.

### Minor safety

Minors’ sense of judgment and identity mature as they develop. To provide teens with additional room for identity exploration and expression in digital spaces, content uploaded by users under the age of 16 is not eligible for recommendation. We strive to encourage healthy development across all ages. The promotion of cosmetic surgery to minors may lead to higher rates of body dissatisfaction. Accordingly, such content -- including before-and-after videos, videos of surgical procedures, and messages discussing elective cosmetic surgery without warning of risks -- are ineligible for the FYF of all users under the age of 18.

### Dangerous stunts and sports

Certain activities can be risky or dangerous when replicated without safety precautions, which could lead to physical harm. Content that includes dangerous stunts, or extreme sports performed by non-professionals, may be ineligible. (We remove content that depicts dangerous acts and challenges performed by non-professionals, which may lead to serious injury or death for the user or the public).

### Overtly sexualized content

We are mindful that not all content may be suitable for all users (particularly our teenage users) and/or may be culturally inappropriate in certain regions. To help maintain a comfortable and age-appropriate experience, content that is overtly sexually suggestive may not be eligible for recommendation. This would include content that depicts implied nudity, sexualizes body parts, or is blatantly erotic or sensual (e.g., strip teases).

### Tobacco and alcohol products

TikTok is deeply committed to protecting the safety of minors on our platform. Content promoting, mentioning, or depicting alcohol products consumed by persons of legal drinking age but done so in a dangerous fashion may not be eligible for recommendation. Content depicting the use of tobacco products by adults or mentioning controlled substances is not eligible for recommendation. Please remember that content which suggests, depicts, imitates, or promotes the possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages, tobacco, or drugs by a minor is prohibited. Content that offers instruction targeting minors on how to buy, sell, or trade alcohol, tobacco, or controlled substances is prohibited per our Community Guidelines as well.

### Violent and graphic content

Our community celebrates creativity, but shock value isn't everyone's preference. Content that can cause discomfort, shock or disgust to viewers may be ineligible for the FYF, including scary effects, jump scares, makeup that realistically replicates gory wounds, or depictions of bodily functions. Most violent and graphic content is not allowed on TikTok; however, in certain situations we may not remove some types of this content such as depictions of graphic deaths, accidents or fighting when real world events are being documented and it is in the public interest. Since this content isn't appropriate for all audiences, it will not be eligible for recommendation and the content will include an “opt-in” screen or warning.

### Spam, inauthentic, or misleading content

We value authenticity and accuracy. We make ineligible for the FYF any content that tricks or manipulates users in order to inauthentically increase followers, likes, views, or other engagement metrics on the platform, including follow-to-follow, like-to-like, and misleading or manipulating users into clicking like or share buttons. Conspiratorial content that counters generally accepted beliefs and casts blame on a group or entity (rather than any living individual) or that includes potentially misleading and harmful content about current, unfolding events where details are still developing, are also ineligible for recommendation.

### Unoriginal, low-quality, and QR code content

Original and entertaining content form the core of the TikTok community. To maintain the positive experience our users expect from the TikTok platform, unoriginal and low-quality content is ineligible for recommendation. We consider content not original if it is imported or uploaded from TikTok, other platforms, or other sources including television, movies, or webcasts, and the user has not added new, creative edits. One indicator that the content is not original is a visible watermark or superimposed logo. Low quality content includes extremely short clips, static images, and exclusively-GIF based videos. Content that includes QR codes is usually ineligible for the FYF because it can lead users to harmful websites or apps, though we make exceptions in certain circumstances where that risk is low (e.g., e-commerce).
