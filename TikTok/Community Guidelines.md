Community Guidelines
====================

Overview
--------

On September 13, 2025, we are updating our Community Guidelines so you can continue to create, discover, and share safely on TikTok. Check out the new Community Guidelines [here](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/?cgversion=2025H2update).

  

Released April 17, 2024

Effective May 17, 2024

TikTok is a source of entertainment and enrichment where you can discover, create, and connect with others across the world. Our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy.

We have Community Guidelines to create a welcoming, safe, and entertaining experience. The guidelines apply to everyone and everything on our platform. They include **rules** for what is allowed on TikTok, as well as **standards** for what is eligible for the For You feed (FYF). To address new risks and harms, the guidelines are updated on an ongoing basis.

To help you read through the guidelines, we organize them by topic area, and highlight each rule in bold. Under each section you can click **_More information_** for definitions, examples, and clarifications to common questions. The examples do not cover everything (we are telling you this now so that you do not have to repeatedly read the phrase "including, but not limited to"). If you are ever in doubt about what to share, please remember to be kind and treat others the way that you would want to be treated.

Thank you for helping to keep TikTok a welcoming space for everyone!

**Content Moderation**

Keeping our platform safe, trustworthy, and vibrant requires balancing creative expression and preventing harm. We use a combination of safety approaches to strike the right balance:

Remove content that we do not allow

Everyone who joins TikTok has the ability to freely share content on the platform. However, we remove content--whether posted publicly or privately--when we find that it violates our rules.

Restrict content that is not suitable for youth

We allow a range of content on our platform, but also recognize that not all of it may be suitable for younger audiences. We restrict content that may not be suitable so that it is only viewed by adults (18 years and older). A summary of restricted content categories can be found [here](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/youth-safety/?cgversion=2024H1update&lang=en).

Make ineligible for the FYF content that does not meet our recommendation standards

The FYF is an opportunity to discover new content and reach new audiences, but it is not guaranteed that all content will be recommended. Content that does not meet our standards will be ineligible for the FYF. A summary of these standards can be found [here](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/fyf-standards/?cgversion=2024H1update&lang=en).

Empower our community with information, tools, and resources

We want to make sure you have the right information to help you manage your experience on TikTok. We may add labels, "opt-in" screens, or warnings to provide more context. Our [safety toolkit](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/community-controls/?lang=en) can help you to filter out content with specific hashtags or comments that you are not comfortable seeing, and we also offer [account controls](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy) and in-app features with [safety resources](https://www.tiktok.com/safety?lang=en).

Community Principles
--------------------

On September 13, 2025, we are updating our Community Guidelines so you can continue to create, discover, and share safely on TikTok. Check out the new Community Guidelines [here](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/?cgversion=2025H2update).

  

Released April 17, 2024

Effective May 17, 2024

TikTok has eight guiding community principles that are grounded in safety and our commitment to respecting [human rights](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/upholding-human-rights/?lang=en). Our principles shape our day-to-day work and guide how we approach difficult enforcement decisions. They are centered on these themes:

* Balancing harm prevention and expression
* Embracing human dignity
* Ensuring our actions are fair

We recognize that sometimes these principles will be in tension with each other, and we carefully consider when we weigh one over another. These considerations are informed by international legal frameworks and industry best practices, including the [UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/publications/guidingprinciplesbusinesshr_en.pdf), the [International Bill of Human Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/en/what-are-human-rights/international-bill-human-rights), the [Convention on the Rights of Children](https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx), and the [Santa Clara Principles](https://santaclaraprinciples.org/). We also seek input from our community, safety and public health experts, and our [Advisory Councils](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/advisory-councils/?lang=en).

1. **Prevent harm:** Our primary focus is keeping TikTok safe and a place for joy. We consider the many ways that content or behavior may impact our diverse community. This includes individual physical, psychological, financial, and privacy harms, as well as societal harms. To strike the right balance with free expression, we restrict content only when necessary and in a way that seeks to minimize the impact on speech.
2. **Enable free expression:** The creativity unlocked by expression is what powers our vibrant community. We honor this principle by providing the opportunity to share freely on our platform while also proactively addressing behavior that can inhibit speech of others. However, free expression is not an absolute right – it is always considered in proportion to its potential harm, and does not extend to having your content recommended in the For You feed.
3. **Foster civility:** Civility creates respect between people and helps communities thrive. The way we engage with each other online can sometimes threaten positive interactions with others, so being civil on TikTok is critical to fulfilling our mission. This means acknowledging everyone’s inherent dignity and conducting ourselves as if we were face-to-face. To ensure space for expression, we do allow more latitude for social critique of [public figures](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/safety-civility?lang=en&cgversion=2024H1update#7).
4. **Respect local context:** TikTok brings together over a billion people across 150+ countries in one shared digital space. We work with regional experts and local communities to help ensure that our global approach considers the way harms are experienced across regions, and that we allow for regional applications of our guidelines, while maintaining a baseline of internationally recognized human rights.
5. **Champion inclusion:** We want people from around the world to feel welcome on our platform. We value and celebrate different cultures, identities, appearances, viewpoints, interests, and experiences. We know some communities historically have been afforded fewer opportunities for engagement, so we are committed to the principle of equality and mitigating harms that disproportionately affect marginalized groups.
6. **Protect individual privacy**: We are committed to protecting and respecting the privacy of our community and of individuals who are shown or discussed in content on the platform. We seek to ensure that content shared on the platform does not expose anyone’s personal information or invade their intimate privacy.
7. **Provide transparency and consistency**: We want everyone to know what our rules and standards are and how we apply them. We seek to provide clear notice of our policies and practices, to apply them consistently and equitably, and to share our enforcement efforts in our [Transparency Center](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency?lang=en). We will be clear throughout the guidelines when we need to prioritize another principle over consistency, such as local context or inclusion.
8. **Be fair and just:** Moderating millions of pieces of content each day is a complex effort, and developing a trusted process to do so is foundational. We are committed to being impartial and evidence-based, producing fair outcomes, giving notice of enforcement actions, and providing an opportunity to appeal.

Youth Safety and Well-Being
---------------------------

On September 13, 2025, we are updating our Community Guidelines so you can continue to create, discover, and share safely on TikTok. Check out the new Community Guidelines [here](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/?cgversion=2025H2update).

  

Released April 17, 2024

Effective May 17, 2024

We are deeply committed to TikTok being a safe and positive experience for people under the age of 18 (we refer to them as "youth" or "young people"). This starts by being old enough to use TikTok. **You must be 13 years and older to have an account.** There are additional age limitations based on local law in some regions.

In the United States, there is a separate [under-13 TikTok experience](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-for-younger-users) that offers additional safeguards, including restricting interactive features, content suitability assessments from [Common Sense Networks](https://www.sensical.tv/common-sense-networks/home), and a dedicated [Privacy Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/childrens-privacy-policy). If you create a new account in the United States with a birthdate that shows you are under the age of 13, you will automatically enter into this experience.

If we learn someone is below the minimum age to have an account on TikTok, we will ban that account. If you believe you were incorrectly banned, you can [appeal](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/underage-appeals-on-tiktok) the decision. Anyone can report accounts that they suspect are under the minimum age, either [in-app](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/report-a-problem/report-a-user) or [online](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/privacy).

We do not allow content that may put young people at risk of psychological, physical, or developmental harm. If we become aware an account holder has a [severe violation](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?lang=en&cgversion=2024H1update#1) or has committed a sexual offense against a young person, we will ban the account, as well as any other accounts belonging to that person. We report incidents of youth sexual abuse and exploitation to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children ([NCMEC](https://www.missingkids.org/HOME)). We also report to relevant law enforcement authorities when there is a specific, credible, and imminent threat to human life or serious physical injury.

To provide young people with an experience that is developmentally suitable and a safe space for self-exploration, we take several steps including:

* Setting minimum age requirements for access to [certain product features](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/account-privacy-settings/privacy-and-safety-settings-for-users-under-age-18), including being 16 years and older to have your content be eligible for the FYF
* Using restrictive [default privacy settings](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/account-privacy-settings/privacy-and-safety-settings-for-users-under-age-18)
* Developing content levels to restrict content that may not be suitable for people under the age of 18, and providing you with content filtering options

You can learn more about TikTok's tools, controls, and educational content on our [Youth Portal](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/youth-portal?lang=en) and in our [Guardian’s Guide](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/guardians-guide/?lang=en).

Released April 17, 2024

Effective May 17, 2024

Physical and psychological safety form the foundation of individual well-being, and civility is key to a thriving community. Being civil does not mean you must always agree, but rather it is about recognizing everyone's inherent dignity and being respectful in action, words, and tone when engaging others.

### Violent and Criminal Behavior

We are committed to bringing people together in a way that does not lead to physical conflict. We recognize that online content related to violence can cause real-world harm. **We do not allow any violent threats, promotion of violence, incitement to violence, or promotion of criminal activities that may harm people, animals, or property.**

If there is a specific, credible, and imminent threat to human life or serious physical injury, we report it to relevant law enforcement authorities.

### Hate Speech and Hateful Behavior

TikTok is enriched by the diversity of our community. Our differences should be embraced, rather than a cause for division. **We do not allow any hate speech, hateful behavior, or promotion of hateful ideologies.** This includes explicit or implicit content that attacks a protected group.

When there are discussions about social issues on TikTok, we want them to be respectful. Content may be ineligible for the FYF when it indirectly demeans protected groups.

Learn more about our work to [counter hate](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/countering-hate/?lang=en), as well as [tools](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/bullying-prevention/?lang=en) that can help limit unwanted interactions, including restricting options for comments, duet, stitch, and messaging.

We want you to share what inspires you, but TikTok is not a place to spread beliefs or propaganda that encourage violence or hate. **We do not allow the presence of violent and hateful organizations or individuals on our platform.** These actors include violent extremists, violent criminal organizations, violent political organizations, hateful organizations, and individuals who cause serial or mass violence. If we become aware that any of these actors may be on our platform, we will conduct a thorough review - including off-platform behavior - which may result in an [account ban](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?lang=en&cgversion=2024H1update).

Often the ideas of these actors are amplified by others. **We do not allow anyone to promote or provide material support to violent or hateful actors.** Content that may appear neutral, such as featuring a quote from a hateful organization or individual, must make clear that there is no intent to promote it.

### Human Trafficking and Smuggling

We are committed to upholding individual human dignity and ensuring TikTok is not used to take advantage of vulnerable people. **We do not allow human trafficking and smuggling.** We understand how important it is for survivors of human trafficking and smuggling to share their stories, and for migrants to be able to document their journeys, so we provide a space to do so.

We report incidents of youth sex trafficking to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children ([NCMEC](https://www.missingkids.org/HOME)). We also report to relevant law enforcement authorities when there is a specific, credible, and imminent threat to human life or serious physical injury.

More information

**Human trafficking** is a form of modern slavery that can occur domestically or internationally and involves the recruitment of victims, coordination of their transport, and their exploitation using force, fraud, coercion, or deception. It can include sex, labor, child, or organ trafficking, forced marriage, forced criminality (such as exploitative begging), domestic servitude, and child soldiers.

We welcome the respectful expression of different viewpoints, and want to ensure that anyone can share their voice without the fear of being degraded or bullied. **We do not allow harassing, degrading, or bullying statements or behavior.** This includes responding to such acts with retaliatory harassment.

We recognize that public figures are in a position of public attention, have ways to counter negative speech, and that some content related to them may be in the [public interest](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/enforcement?lang=en&cgversion=2024H1update) to view. We do allow some negative or critical comments or images about public figures. However, we still remove content that violates other policies (such as violent threats, hate speech, or sexual exploitation), as well as serious forms of harassment (such as doxxing or expressing a desire that someone experience serious physical harm).

If you or someone you know is being bullied, help is available. We offer [support resources](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/bullying-prevention/?lang=en), as well as [tools](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/bullying-prevention?lang=en) that can help limit harmful interactions, including restricting options for comments, duet, stitch, and messaging.

More information

**Doxxing** involves publishing personal information about someone online with a malicious intent. We recognize intent can be subjective, so we use objective indicators to help us understand it, such as captions and hashtags.

**Public figures** are adults (18 years and older) with a significant public role, such as a government official, politician, business leader, or celebrity. We do not identify people under the age of 18 as public figures.

**Private figures** are all people under the age of 18, and adults (18 years and older) who are not public figures.

Sensitive and Mature Themes
---------------------------

On September 13, 2025, we are updating our Community Guidelines so you can continue to create, discover, and share safely on TikTok. Check out the new Community Guidelines [here](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/?cgversion=2025H2update).

  

Released April 17, 2024

Effective May 17, 2024

TikTok provides content that ranges from very family friendly to more mature. Given the diversity of our global community, developmental and cultural considerations inform our approach to potentially sensitive and more mature content that may be considered offensive by some. To honor our principle of [respecting local context](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/community-principles?lang=en&cgversion=2024H1update) and not imposing the norms of one country on another, some of the applications of the guidelines in this section differ across regions.

### Sexual Activity and Services

TikTok is a place where you can come to discuss or learn about sexuality, sex, or reproductive health. We are mindful that certain content may not be suitable for young people, may be considered offensive by some, or may create the potential for exploitation. **We do not allow sexual activity or services.** This includes sex, sexual arousal, fetish and kink behavior, and seeking or offering sexual services. However, it does not include reproductive health and sex education content.

More information

**Fetish and kink behavior** includes BDSM (bondage, discipline, domination, submission, sadism, and masochism), and sexual behaviors with non-human objects or with specific body parts (such as a foot fetish).

* * *

### Nudity and Body Exposure

We celebrate all shapes and sizes and want you to feel comfortable in how you present yourself and your body. We understand societies approach body exposure and clothing differently, so we seek to reflect prevailing cultural practices. **We do not allow nudity.** This includes bare genitalia, buttocks, breasts of women and girls, and sheer clothing.

We want to provide young people with an experience that is developmentally suitable. **We** **do not allow semi-nudity or significant body exposure of young people.** Content is ineligible for the FYF if it shows body exposure of a young person that may present a risk of uninvited sexualization.

We also do not want to amplify content that may not be suitable for a wide audience. Content is restricted (18 years and older) and is ineligible for the FYF if it shows semi-nudity of an adult. We allow regional exceptions for body exposure in limited situations, such as cultural practices.

More information

**Nudity** means being unclothed and showing bare intimate body parts that prevailing cultural practices indicate should be fully covered. This includes bare breasts of women and girls, but not of men and boys (including those who are transgender or intersex), or people who are non-binary. We recognize that some individuals do not describe their gender in binary terms, and acknowledge the complexity of applying this policy. When reviewing such content, we look at how someone self-describes using first-party information and indicators, such as captions, hashtags, or bio, and then may also look at how the person presents.

**Intimate body parts** means genitalia, buttocks, and breasts (including nipple and areola).

**Semi-nudity** means being mostly unclothed and close to (but not actually) nude, such as implied nudity or wearing clothes that minimally cover intimate body parts.

**Significant body exposure** means being clothed but having partially uncovered intimate body parts or only wearing intimate clothing, such as underwear.

NOT ALLOWED

* Showing nudity of adults and young people, including photography and digitally created images, such as manga and anime _(learn more about CSAM in [Youth Exploitation](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/safety-civility?lang=en&cgversion=2024H1update#4))_

* * *

### Sexually Suggestive Content

We welcome you to creatively express yourself, celebrate your culture, or seek to entertain. We are mindful that certain behaviors related to sexual arousal or suggestiveness may be offensive to some people and may put young people at risk of exploitation. **We do not allow content by young people that intends to be sexually suggestive.** This includes intimate kissing, sexualized framing, or sexualized behavior. **We also do not allow sexually explicit language by anyone.** We do allow some artistic content with sexual references, such as song lyrics.

Content is restricted (18 years and older) and ineligible for the FYF if it shows intimate kissing, sexualized framing, or sexualized behavior by adults, or if it shows sex products.

More information

**Intent** is referenced to be clear that other people finding you sexually arousing is not against the rules. However, we also acknowledge that intent can be subjective. To help us understand it, we use objective indicators, including a bio, hashtags, captions (such as "do you like what you see"), or sounds (such as moaning). We also recognize that different regions have varying views on what is considered sexually suggestive, which also informs our assessment.

**Intimate body parts** means genitalia, buttocks, and breasts (including nipple and areola).

**Intimate kissing** means kissing that may indicate sexual arousal or the beginning of a sexual interaction.

**Sexualized framing** means content that intentionally emphasizes clothed intimate body parts through techniques, such as filming, editing, or positioning of the body in front of the camera.

**Sexualized behavior** means behavior that is intended to be sexually arousing, including performances or repetitive body movements emphasizing intimate body parts, and imitating sexual acts.

**Sex product** means an object or device that is designed to be used for sexual pleasure, such as a sex toy.

### Shocking and Graphic Content

Part of the joy of TikTok is coming across new and unexpected content. But the platform is not a place to intentionally shock, upset, or disgust others. We recognize this type of content may be triggering, cause psychological harm, or lead to extreme discomfort. **We do not allow gory, gruesome, disturbing, or extremely violent content.**

Content is restricted (18 years and older) and ineligible for the FYF if it shows human or animal blood, extreme physical fighting, or graphic footage of events that would otherwise violate our rules but are in the [public interest](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/enforcement?lang=en&cgversion=2024H1update#1) to view. Content is also ineligible for the FYF if it shows fictional graphic violence or potentially distressing or mildly graphic material.

### Misinformation

In a global community, it is natural for people to have different opinions, but we seek to operate on a shared set of facts and reality. **We do not allow misinformation that may cause significant harm to individuals or society, regardless of intent.** We rely on [independent fact-checking partners](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/safety-partners/?lang=en), guidance from public health authorities, and our database of previously fact-checked claims to help assess the accuracy of content.

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it contains misinformation that may cause moderate harm, such as certain health content, conspiracy theories, repurposed media, or misrepresented authoritative sources. To be cautious, unverified information about emergencies and content temporarily under review by fact-checkers is also ineligible for the FYF.

To help you manage your TikTok experience, we may apply warning labels to content that has been assessed by our fact-checking partners and cannot be verified as accurate.

### Edited Media and AI-Generated Content (AIGC)

We welcome the creativity that new artificial intelligence (AI) and other digital technologies may unlock. However, AI and other digital editing technologies can make it difficult to tell the difference between fact and fiction, which may mislead individuals or harm society. **We require you to label AIGC or edited media that shows realistic-appearing scenes or people.** This can be done using the [AIGC label](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/creating-videos/ai-generated-content), or by adding a clear caption, watermark, or sticker of your own.

Even when appropriately labeled, AIGC or edited media may still be harmful. **We do not allow content that shares or shows fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts.** This includes being bullied, making an endorsement, or being endorsed.

We are committed to protecting people's privacy. **We do not allow content that contains the likeness of young people, or the likeness of adult private figures used without their permission.**

More information

**AI-generated content (AIGC)** is content, including images, video, or audio, that is created or modified by artificial intelligence (AI) technology or machine-learning processes. This content may include images of real people, and may show highly realistic-appearing scenes or use a particular artistic style, such as a painting, cartoons, or anime.

**Significantly edited content** is content that shows people doing something they did not do, saying something they did not say, or altering their appearance in a way that makes them difficult to recognize or identify. This includes applying certain face filters, or an animation of an individual.

**Misleading AIGC or edited media** is audio or visual content that has been edited, including by combining different clips together, to change the composition, sequencing, or timing in a way that alters the meaning of the content and could mislead viewers about the truth of real world events.

**Realistic-appearing scenes or people** is content that uses are scenes, using images, video, or audio, that would lead someone to believe that the person shown is real or the event took place in the real world, such as a scene that is shown in the style or quality of a photograph or video.

**Likeness** is a clear representation of an individual. It includes audio and visual representation, and may show their face, body, or their distinctive appearance, gestures, or mannerisms.

**Public figures** are adults (18 years and older) with a significant public role, such as a government official, politician, business leader, or celebrity. We do not identify people under the age of 18 as public figures.

Learn more about our [intellectual property (IP) policies](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/global/copyright-policy/en).

**Trademarks** are words, symbols, slogans, designs, or a combination of these that identifies the source of a product or service and distinguishes it from other products or services.

### Spam and Deceptive Behavior

To build a trusted community online, it is important that the behaviors and identities on your accounts are authentic and truthful. **We do not allow account behavior that may spam or mislead our community.** This includes conducting covert influence operations, manipulating engagement signals to amplify the reach of certain content, and operating spam or impersonation accounts. Parody or fan-based accounts are allowed, as long as they are clearly disclosed in the _account_ name (note that this is different than the @username).

You can set up multiple accounts to create different channels for authentic creative expression, but not for deceptive purposes. **We do not allow the use of accounts to engage in platform manipulation.** This includes the use of automation to register or operate accounts in bulk, distribute high-volume commercial content, artificially increase engagement signals, and circumvent enforcement of our guidelines.

If any of your accounts have been banned, or restricted from using a feature, you must not set up a new account or use a different existing account to get around the ban or restriction.

If we determine you have engaged in any of these deceptive account behaviors, we will [ban the account](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?lang=en&cgversion=2024H1update), and may ban any alternative accounts being used or new accounts that are created.

More information

**Covert influence operations** (CIO) are coordinated, inauthentic behaviors where networks of accounts work together to mislead people or our systems and try to strategically influence public discussion. This may include attempting to undermine the results of an election, influencing parts of an armed conflict, or shaping public discussion of social issues. Learn more about [covert influence operations](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/countering-influence-operations/?lang=en).

* **Covert influence operations,** including:

* Bypass restrictions placed on an account, including using the alternative account to access features that have been restricted on another account, such as a temporary LIVE suspension

We know that protecting your privacy rights and personal information, and keeping our platform secure, are critical to maintaining your trust and ensuring your safety.

### Personal Information

Content shared online may be seen by anyone, and has a wide reach. We are committed to making sure that any personal information shared intentionally or accidentally on TikTok does not lead to harm. **We do not allow content that includes personal information that may pose a risk of stalking, violence, phishing, fraud, identity theft, or financial exploitation.** This includes content that someone has posted themselves or that they consented to being shared by others.

For You feed Eligibility Standards
----------------------------------

On September 13, 2025, we are updating our Community Guidelines so you can continue to create, discover, and share safely on TikTok. Check out the new Community Guidelines [here](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/?cgversion=2025H2update).

  

Released April 17, 2024

Effective May 17, 2024

The For You feed (FYF) is a unique TikTok feature that uses a personalized recommendation system to allow you to discover a breadth of content, creators, and topics. In determining what gets recommended, the system takes into account factors including likes, shares, comments, searches, diversity of content, and popular videos. Learn more about the [recommendation system](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/recommendation-system/?lang=en), as well as [tools to help customize](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/more-ways-for-our-community-to-enjoy-what-they-love) recommendations.

Certain types of content may be fine if seen occasionally, but problematic if viewed in clusters. This includes content such as dieting, extreme fitness, sexual suggestiveness, sadness (such as statements of hopelessness, or sharing sad quotes), and overgeneralized mental health information (such as a quiz that claims to diagnose someone). This type of content may be eligible for the FYF but, we will interrupt repetitive content patterns to ensure it is not viewed too often. Learn more about our approach to [safeguarding and diversifying](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/an-update-on-our-work-to-safeguard-and-diversify-recommendations) recommendations.

We maintain content eligibility standards for the FYF that prioritize safety and are informed by the diversity of our community and cultural practices. While the spontaneity of the FYF is what makes TikTok unique, it is intended for a range of audiences that includes everyone from teenagers to great grandparents. **We make ineligible for the FYF, and may also make harder to find in search, certain content that may not be suitable for a broad audience.**

We know that the FYF provides an opportunity to reach a large audience, which is not always suitable for some young people. **We make content created by anyone under 16 years old ineligible for the For You feed (FYF).**

Content that is ineligible for the FYF can still be discovered in other ways, such as through search tools or by following an account. When a video does not get many views, it may be due to a lack of community engagement rather than being ineligible for the FYF. Creators can use the [TikTok analytics tool](https://www.tiktok.com/creators/creator-portal/en-us/tiktok-content-strategy/understanding-your-analytics/) to track the performance of their videos.

Throughout our guidelines, you will see eligibility standards for the FYF. Here is a consolidated "quick guide" of content that is ineligible for the FYF.

Accounts and Features
---------------------

On September 13, 2025, we are updating our Community Guidelines so you can continue to create, discover, and share safely on TikTok. Check out the new Community Guidelines [here](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/?cgversion=2025H2update).

  

Released April 17, 2024

Effective May 17, 2024

### Accounts

**You must be 13 years and older to have an account.** There are additional age limitations based on local law in some regions. In the United States, there is a separate [under 13 TikTok experience](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-for-younger-users), which provides a more limited experience designed with additional safety protections and a dedicated [Privacy Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/childrens-privacy-policy). If we learn someone is below the minimum age to have an account on TikTok, we will ban that account.

Violating our rules can lead to enforcement actions on accounts. **We will ban accounts or account holders if they engage in:**

* **A single severe content violation**
* **Repeated content violations**
* **Circumventing enforcement of our guidelines**
* **The operation of accounts dedicated to activity that violates our rules**

This includes all activity that has a primary purpose that is not allowed on our platform, such as accounts focused on hate speech, the trade or marketing of prohibited goods, spam, or impersonation _(learn more about circumvention and dedicated accounts in [Spam and Deceptive Behavior](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/integrity-authenticity/?lang=en&cgversion=2024H1update#6))_. In the case of [severe violations](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?lang=en&cgversion=2024H1update#1) of our rules or engagement in circumvention behavior, we may also ban any other existing accounts of the account holder on our platform.

We will also ban an account if we become aware that the account holder is a [violent or hateful actor](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/safety-civility?lang=en&cgversion=2024H1update#3) or has committed a sexual offense against a young person. We consider off-platform activity related to violence, hate, and child sexual abuse or exploitation to help make decisions about these account bans. We report accounts to law enforcement authorities if there is a specific, credible, and imminent threat to human life or serious physical injury.

Repeatedly posting content that is allowed on our platform but ineligible for the FYF may lead to the account and its content being ineligible for recommendation, including being ineligible for the FYF and harder to find in search. Learn more about our general approach to [account enforcement](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/content-violations-and-bans).

**News and Government, Politician, and Political Party Accounts**

News entities, governments, politicians, and political party accounts all play important roles in civic processes and civil society. While we treat their content just like any other account and remove violations, we approach account-level enforcement differently to align with our commitment to respecting human rights and [free expression](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/community-principles?lang=en&cgversion=2024H1update). These public interest accounts will be banned for any single severe content violation, such as threatening violence. For repeated content violations that are less severe, they will be temporarily ineligible to appear in the FYF and in the feeds of their followers. In limited circumstances, they may also be temporarily restricted from posting new content.

### TikTok LIVE

[TikTok LIVE](https://support.tiktok.com/en/live-gifts-wallet/tiktok-live) allows you to create content, interact with audiences, and build your community in real-time. To support a safe experience on LIVE, we restrict young people from using this feature. **You must be 18 years and older to go LIVE, and to send gifts to a creator during a LIVE session**.

A violation of our rules will lead to closing an ongoing LIVE session, and may lead to temporary restrictions on using LIVE or [LIVE features](https://livecenter.tiktok.com/rules_and_guidance/live_feature_guidelines?can_feedback=false&has_feedback=false&content_id=4&enter_from=rg_rules_handbook), or an account ban. Accounts must meet [relevant entry criteria](https://livecenter.tiktok.com/rules_and_guidance/live_feature_guidelines?can_feedback=false&has_feedback=false&content_id=4&enter_from=rg_rules_handbook) to be eligible for certain LIVE monetization features.

A LIVE is ineligible for the FYF when it shares content that is ineligible for the FYF, or when the main purpose of the LIVE is redirecting people to go off-platform. A LIVE is restricted (18 years and older) when it shares [content that is not suitable for young people](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/youth-safety?lang=en&cgversion=2024H1update). If a LIVE repeatedly shares content that is ineligible for the FYF, we apply temporary restrictions on the account holder, including restricting the visibility of their LIVE sessions or their use of certain LIVE features.

In a [multi-guest LIVE](https://support.tiktok.com/en/live-gifts-wallet/tiktok-live/tiktok-live-multi-guest), the host account is responsible for content streamed in their LIVE. Hosts must not facilitate a guests' sharing of content that violates our rules or does not meet our FYF standards. If guests stream violative content, it will lead to closing the multi-LIVE session, and may lead to temporary LIVE access restrictions for the host or guests. If guests stream content ineligible for the FYF, it will make the LIVE ineligible for the FYF.

### Search

Using the search tool can be an enriching and helpful way to discover content on the platform. When you perform a search, we seek to provide you with relevant search results. **We restrict searches that use keywords or phrases that violate our rules.** Content that is allowed on the platform but does not meet our recommendation eligibility may not appear as a top search result.

We provide search suggestions that are relevant to you. These search suggestions can be found throughout the platform, including autocomplete in the search tool, content from the You May Like section, and while watching content in the FYF.

* * *

### External Links

Links are often shared in a profile, bio, or content to connect you to additional content or to other sites. While some links may be helpful or informative, others connect to harmful content that would not be allowed on our platform. **We do not allow posting links that direct people to content that violate our rules**. A violation of our rules will lead to a removal of the link, a temporary restriction on re-uploading another link, or an account ban. If a link connects to content that would qualify as a [severe violation](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?lang=en&cgversion=2024H1update#1) of our rules, we may also ban the account.

### Comments and Direct Messages

Comments and direct messages on TikTok allow you to interact with videos or directly with others, and provide an integral interactive experience to the platform. **You must be 16 years and older to use direct messages, and 18 years and older to use advanced messaging features, such as group messages in some regions.**

A violation of our rules will lead to restricted visibility or the removal of comments, or a restriction on sending direct messages, and may lead to an account ban if there is a [severe violation](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?lang=en&cgversion=2024H1update#1).

### Monetization

We offer tools that let creators monetize their content, and that give businesses the ability to operate and expand their enterprise. **You must be 18 years and older to use monetization features.**

Accounts must satisfy the relevant entry criteria to be eligible for our monetization features. Some monetization features, such as LIVE gifting, may have additional standards to use them. A violation of our rules may result in a temporary restriction of monetization features, and repeated violations will lead to a permanent restriction or an account ban. Content that is ineligible in the FYF may be restricted from monetization features.

All commercial content on TikTok must be disclosed and must comply with the relevant monetized feature policy, such as the [Branded Content Policy](https://support.tiktok.com/en/business-and-creator/creator-and-business-accounts/branded-content-policy), [TikTok’s Ads Creative Policy](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=9552), [Industry Entry Policy](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=9550), and [TikTok Shop Policies](https://seller-uk.tiktok.com/university/policy?content_id=10003962&identity=1). If we become aware of marketing content that has not been clearly disclosed, we will apply the [content disclosure setting](https://support.tiktok.com/en/business-and-creator/creator-and-business-accounts/promoting-a-brand-product-or-service). Commercial content includes promoting your own brand, products, or services, or exchanging something of value between creators, a third party and creator (such as Branded Content), a creator and business (such as e-commerce), or a creator and TikTok (such as the Creator fund).

Enforcement
-----------

On September 13, 2025, we are updating our Community Guidelines so you can continue to create, discover, and share safely on TikTok. Check out the new Community Guidelines [here](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/overview?lang={lang}&cgversion=2025H2update).

  

Released April 17, 2024

Effective May 17, 2024

### Public Interest Exceptions

We recognize that some content that would otherwise violate our rules may be in the public interest to view. Public interest refers to topics that inform, inspire, or educate the community and enhance deliberation about matters of broad collective significance. We may allow content to remain on TikTok under one of these public interest exceptions:

* Documentary
* Educational
* Medical and Scientific
* Counterspeech
* Satirical
* Artistic

Our approach to content moderation uses the same criteria, no matter who creates it. The most important factor we consider in looking at public interest exceptions is context, such as whether the content is raising awareness or criticizing harmful behaviors. To help us in our review, we encourage you to clearly show context using features such as captions, voice over, or stickers.

We may add extra safety measures to some content allowed under a public interest exception, such as making it ineligible for the FYF or adding a label, "opt-in" screen, or warning information. We do not provide exceptions for public interest content if it may cause extreme harm, such as showing a suicide or sexual abuse of a young person.

### Detection and Reporting

We aim to remove content or accounts that violate our rules before they are viewed or shared. Content first goes through an automated review process. If content is identified as a potential violation, it will be automatically removed, or flagged for additional review by our moderators. Additional review will occur if content gains popularity or has been reported. To support moderation accuracy, we apply additional quality assurance processes to some accounts that have already gone through additional validation processes, such as verified accounts.

Although we work hard to enforce our guidelines, we cannot guarantee that all content shared complies with our guidelines or [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/row/terms-of-service/en). Suspected violations can be [reported](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/report-a-problem) in-app and on our website. If you discover content or accounts that may violate our rules, please let us know so we can review it and take any appropriate action.

Learn more about our enforcement efforts through our [Transparency Center](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/?lang=en).

### Notice and Appeals

In keeping with our commitment to ensuring [procedural fairness](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/community-principles?lang=en&cgversion=2024H1update), we seek to provide notifications if you have violated our rules. If you have posted content that we do not allow, we will notify you and share the reason for the removal. If your account has been banned because of a violation, you will receive a banner notification when you next open the app, informing you of this account change. If you have posted content that is ineligible for the For You feed (FYF), or is otherwise restricted, this information will appear in the [TikTok analytics tool](https://www.tiktok.com/creators/creator-portal/en/tiktok-content-strategy/understanding-your-analytics/).

If your account was banned, or your content was violated, made ineligible for the FYF, or otherwise restricted, and you believe it was an error, then you can [appeal the decision](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/content-violations-and-bans#4). You can view the [status of your appeal](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/content-violations-and-bans) in the in-app Safety Center, as well as the status of any reports you have filed about other content or accounts.
