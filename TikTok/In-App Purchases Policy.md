_Last updated: July 2025_

  

(This Virtual Items Policy applies to users living in the European Economic Area (EEA), Switzerland and the UK)

**You must be at least 18 years old to buy, use or collect certain Virtual Items, including, but not limited to, Coins and Diamonds.**

This Virtual Items Policy applies to the access and use of Virtual Items (defined below) on the Platform (“**Virtual Items Policy**”). Virtual Items may also be governed by separate applicable product, program, promotion, and/or campaign terms. If this is the case, these additional terms will be made available to you when you use the product or take part in the program, promotion, and/or campaign ("**Virtual Items Terms**") or Rewards Program.

TikTok Information Technologies UK Limited (a company registered in England) and TikTok Technology Limited (a company registered in Ireland) jointly make Virtual Items available via the Platform. However, the TikTok entity that is solely responsible for any payment, financial or tax obligations in relation to Virtual Items is TikTok Information Technologies UK Limited.

Our [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-service) and [Community Guidelines](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines) also apply to, among other things, your access and use of Virtual Items on the Platform. Our [Privacy Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy) describes how we process your personal data.

If there is a conflict between this Virtual Items Policy and the [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-service) or [Community Guidelines](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines), this Virtual Items Policy will apply. If there is a conflict between this Virtual Items Policy and any applicable Virtual Items Terms, the Virtual Items Terms will apply.

Capitalised terms not defined in this Virtual Items Policy have the meanings given to them in our [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-service) or our Rewards Policy.

_In short: This Virtual Items Policy and any applicable Virtual Items Terms set out the rules that apply when you access or use Virtual Items on the Platform. You must also comply with our_ [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-service-eea?lang=en) _and_ [Community Guidelines](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/)_. You should read these documents._

**1\. What are Virtual Items and how can you use them?**

Virtual Items are digital items, representations or services that TikTok may give users access to from time to time for use solely on our Platform, including, for example: Coins, Gifts, Diamonds, and Points (all defined below), and profile frames (each, a "**Virtual Item**").

Virtual Items are used by users to express themselves, as an indicator of their engagement on the Platform, and/or to access or activate certain services on the Platform.

**Virtual Items cannot be exchanged for cash or used as currency.** Virtual Items can only be purchased or received from TikTok. Virtual Items cannot be purchased or received from, sold to, or exchanged with other Platform users, nor can they be used to purchase, access or activate goods and services provided by a third party.

_In short: Virtual Items are digital items, representations or services that TikTok may provide you to access and use on the TikTok Platform. Virtual Items cannot be exchanged for cash or used as currency._

**2\. Coins**

**2.1 What are Coins?**

Coins are digital items that can be used on the Platform to access or activate other Virtual Items or services offered by TikTok (each, a “**Coin**”). Coins can be purchased from TikTok by users of the Platform who are at least 18 years old. The purchase and use of Coins is entirely voluntary.

_In short: You can buy Coins and use them on the Platform to access or activate other Virtual Items or services._

**2.2 How can you use Coins?**

Coins can only be used on the Platform to access or activate certain types of other Virtual Items (e.g., [Gifts](https://support.tiktok.com/en/live-gifts-wallet/gifts/gifts), Heart Mes) or services (e.g., TikTok's [Promote advertising service](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/growing-your-audience/use-promote-to-grow-your-tiktok-audience) or the sending of Star Comments) that may be made available by TikTok from time to time.

The number of Coins needed to access or activate other Virtual Items or services will be displayed before you use those Coins. You should check how many Coins you need for any Virtual Items you want to access or activate before you purchase the Coins. You can track how much you spend on Coins, and how you use them, in the following ways:

* The total number of Coins in your account will be updated each time you purchase Coins or use them to access other Virtual Items or services. You can view your available Coins in several places on the Platform, including when you are about to use them to access or activate Virtual Items or services.
* The Transaction History in your account shows you how much you have spent to buy Coins.
* The Coin History in your account shows a record of the number of Coins you have purchased and how you have used them to access or activate Virtual Items or services on the Platform.

_In short: You can only use Coins on the Platform. They can be used to access or activate other Virtual Items or TikTok services. You can view your previous Coin activity, including the total Coins you have, within your account._

**2.3 How do you buy Coins?**

Coins can be purchased from within the TikTok app (i.e. an in-app purchase) and handled by a third-party app store such as Apple’s App Store, the Google Play Store, or Amazon's Appstore (each, an "**App Store**") or, in countries where it is available, directly through a TikTok website (the "**WebApp**"). Depending on your country, you may also be able to purchase Coins through a gift card, which can be redeemed on the WebApp. TikTok may also allow users additional ways to collect Coins from time to time.

To buy Coins from TikTok or an App Store and use them, you must:

a. be a registered user of the Platform; and

b. be at least 18 years old.

When you buy Coins, the cost per Coin differs depending on how many you buy and where you buy them (in some countries the cost per Coin will be displayed before you buy them).

If you buy Coins through an App Store as an in-app purchase, the applicable store’s terms for in-app purchases apply as well as this Virtual Items Policy. If you have any questions about in-app purchases of Coins through an App Store (including if you wish to cancel any purchase of Coins you have made), you need to contact the relevant App Store.

If you buy Coins through the WebApp, the total price payable for the Coins will be displayed at the point of purchase. Where possible, and where required by applicable laws, we will also display the total price on the page where the Coins are advertised for sale.

If you purchase a gift card to redeem Coins, the relevant gift card terms and conditions will also apply.

All charges and payments for Coins will be made in the currency specified at the point of purchase. When buying Coins, the price displayed will include any taxes or applicable charges. Additional fees may be imposed by your payment provider, for example currency exchange fees or foreign transaction fees.

_In short: You can buy Coins directly from TikTok, via a gift card or through third-party App Stores. The terms and conditions that apply to the purchase will depend on the method used to purchase Coins._

**2.4 Refunds and changing your mind**

**Coins purchased through an App Store**

If you have purchased Coins from within the TikTok app through an App Store, you will have to directly contact the relevant App Store for any refunds or cancellations. Refunds or cancellations of in-app purchases are handled by the App Store, not TikTok, and are subject to the App Store's refund policies.

When you submit a request for a refund, we may freeze the corresponding number of Coins for which you are seeking a refund. If your refund request is successful, we will deduct the relevant number of Coins from your account. If the remaining number of Coins in your account is insufficient for deduction, we reserve the right to deduct the applicable amount from your future Coin purchases.

**Coins purchased directly from TikTok**

You have certain rights to withdraw from online purchases under consumer laws. If you have bought Coins directly from TikTok (for example via the WebApp):

* You have 14 days to withdraw from your purchase of Coins and request a refund, starting from the day after you purchase Coins (the “**Withdrawal Period**”). You don’t have to give us any reason to request a refund.
* You will not be able to request a refund (i) after the Withdrawal Period or (ii) for any Coins you have used during the Withdrawal Period.
* To withdraw from your purchase of Coins, please contact our customer support team [here](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/transaction) and provide us with the transaction ID of the purchase that you wish to withdraw from. Alternatively, you can complete and send us the model withdrawal form [here](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/model-withdrawal-form-eea?lang=en).
* If you withdraw from your purchase, we will provide you with a refund of the payment received from you for the Coins. Refunds will be issued to the original payment method and may take up to 7 business days to appear in your account, depending on the payment method used to make the purchase. TikTok will not charge you any fees in connection with the refund.

_In short: If you buy Coins from an App Store, you will have to contact the App Store about refunds and changing your mind. If you buy Coins directly from TikTok, you have 14 days to change your mind and get a refund, as long as the Coins have not been used._

**3\. Gifts**

Gifts are digital items that can be accessed or activated using Coins and are exclusively available on the Platform (each, a “**Gift**”). Gifting:

* is a way to express your personality and appreciation for the content with a unique or specialised reaction; and
* allows you to interact with the content you enjoy.

When you gift, other Platform users can see your username and the details of the Gift. By gifting, you are not transferring money, Coins, or anything of value to other users on the Platform. The number of Coins required to activate a Gift will depend on the type of Gift.

The type and number of Gifts activated in a LIVE is used by TikTok to determine the popularity of content and a user (which TikTok measures in Diamonds).

Because Gifts are accessed with immediate effect and consumed immediately upon activation, they are **not returnable or refundable in any circumstances**.

_In short: You can use Coins to access and activate Gifts to express yourself and interact with content you enjoy. Gifting does not transfer anything of value to other users._

**4\. Diamonds**

TikTok uses Diamonds to recognise a user's popularity and ranking on the Platform (each, a “**Diamond**”). Users collect Diamonds based on the level of viewer engagement their content receives. The more popular a user is, and the more high-quality contributions they provide on the Platform, the more Diamonds TikTok allocates to them.

A user's popularity (measured in Diamonds and ranking) is one of several factors TikTok takes into account to determine the Rewards it may give a user under the applicable Rewards Program Terms and our Rewards Policy.

Diamonds do not automatically entitle a user to receive Rewards, including a Reward Payment.

If we reasonably believe a user's popularity (and their associated Diamonds and/or ranking) has been influenced by a breach of our [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-service), [Community Guidelines](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines), applicable Rewards Program Terms, this Virtual Items Policy, and/or, if they are a creator, our [LIVE Monetization Guidelines](https://www.tiktok.com/live/creators/en-US/rules_and_guidance/live_monetization_guidelines) or [Creator Code of Conduct](https://www.tiktok.com/creator-academy/en/article/creator-code-of-conduct), TikTok may apply a proportionate reduction to the number of Diamonds collected by that user. Where appropriate, we will let you know if we do this and the reasons for doing so.

_In short: TikTok may allocate Diamonds to you to measure your popularity and the popularity of your content on our Platform. Popularity is a factor TikTok takes into account to determine the Rewards it may offer you._

**5\. Points**

Points are digital items TikTok may allocate to users when they complete Engagement Actions (as defined in the Rewards Policy), or as part of a Referral Program (each, a “**Point**”). In some cases, subject to applicable Virtual Items Terms, Rewards Program Terms, and/or applicable Rewards Program-specific provisions, users may be eligible to redeem Points for a Reward. However, Points do not automatically entitle a user to claim any Reward.

The number of Points required to redeem a Reward, and what Rewards are available for redemption, will depend on the applicable Rewards Program.

_In short: You may be eligible to receive Points by completing certain activities, and in some cases Points may be redeemed for a Reward._

**6\. Your Rights**

We give you permission (called a limited licence) to use Virtual Items only for your personal use on the Platform consistent with the uses as determined by TikTok and this Virtual Items Policy and any applicable Virtual Items Terms. This means you have no right or title in Virtual Items except as expressly stated in this Virtual Items Policy and any applicable Virtual Items Terms. **You cannot buy, sell, assign, transfer or exchange Virtual Items outside of the Platform, or attempt to sell, assign, transfer, give or trade Virtual Items** otherwise than as expressly permitted in this Virtual Items Policy, any applicable Virtual Items Terms, or otherwise by us in applicable Reward Program Terms.

We may terminate or suspend your right to access Virtual Items, or to buy Coins, immediately and without notice if we reasonably believe that you have materially breached our [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-service), [Community Guidelines](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines), this Virtual Items Policy, any applicable Virtual Items Terms, and/or, if you are a creator, our [LIVE Monetization Guidelines](https://www.tiktok.com/live/creators/en-US/rules_and_guidance/live_monetization_guidelines) or [Creator Code of Conduct](https://www.tiktok.com/creator-academy/en/article/creator-code-of-conduct). If you believe that we have made an error in this regard, you can either follow the instructions to appeal on the violation notice (if applicable) or you can get in touch using our feedback form [here](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/feedback?lang=en).

If your account on the Platform is deactivated or terminated before you use your Virtual Items, you will not be entitled to a refund or any additional access to, or value from, such Virtual Items, unless required by applicable law, so we encourage you to use your Virtual Items (where possible) before you cease to have access to your account. However, if your account is deactivated or terminated during the Withdrawal Period for Coins that you have purchased via a Webapp, you may request a refund for any unused Coin, as set out in 'Refunds and changing your mind' in section 2.4 above.

_In short: Your permission to use Virtual Items is subject to TikTok's rules. If you break our rules, TikTok can take action against you, which may include terminating your access to Virtual Items, including Coins you purchased._
