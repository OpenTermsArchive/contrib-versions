TikTok respects the intellectual property rights of others, and we expect you to do the same. TikTok’s [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/en/terms-of-use) and [Community Guidelines](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines) do not allow posting, sharing, or sending any content that violates or infringes someone else’s copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights.

  

**Copyright**
-------------

Copyright is a legal right that protects original works of authorship (e.g., music, videos, etc.). Generally, copyright protects an original expression of an idea (e.g., the specific way a video or music is expressed or created) but does not protect underlying ideas or facts.

### **Copyright Infringement**

We do not allow any content that infringes copyright. The use of copyrighted content of others without proper authorization or legally valid reason may lead to a violation of TikTok's policies. 

At the same time, not all unauthorized uses of copyrighted content constitute an infringement. Exceptions to copyright infringement, such as the fair use doctrine or other applicable laws, allow use of copyrighted work under certain circumstances.

### **Removal of Content; Suspension or Termination of Account**

Any user content that infringes other person’s copyright may be removed. The account may be suspended or terminated for multiple copyright violations in connection with the use of the TikTok site or app, or other violations of the [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/en/terms-of-use) and [Community Guidelines](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines). We reserve the right to refuse any account holder whose account was used for improper activities from opening a new account on TikTok’s site or app, or otherwise hosted by TikTok. 

### **Copyright Infringement Notification**

Contacting the user directly may resolve your complaint more quickly and in a way that is more beneficial to you, the user, and our community. You may also file a [Copyright Infringement Report](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/Copyright). 

All complaints should contain the information requested in our online Copyright Infringement Report form. Failure to include necessary information may limit our ability to investigate your claims and may result in your complaint being denied. 

We may provide the account holder with your contact information, including the email address and the name of the copyright owner, and/or details of the complaint.

Before submitting a notification, please be aware that intentionally submitting a misleading or fraudulent report may lead to liability for damages under section 512(f) of the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) or similar laws as may be applicable in other countries.

### **Copyright Infringement Counter-Notification**

If you receive a copyright infringement notification that you believe to be in error or believe that you are authorised to use the content, you can reach out to the copyright owner directly to request a retraction. 

You may also provide us with a counter-notification via our [Counter Notification Form](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/counternotification). All counter-notification should contain the information requested in the Counter Notification Form. Failure to include necessary information may limit our ability to investigate your claims and may result in your counter-notification being denied. 

The counter-notification process will take time to complete, please be patient. During this time, the copyright claimant may file an action seeking a court order to keep the content down in pursuant to the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) or similar laws in other countries. Please note that we will forward the entire counter-notification to the original reporter, including any contact information you provide, in accordance with our Terms of Services and Privacy Policy. The claimant may use this information to file a lawsuit against you.

If we do not receive notice that the original reporter is seeking a court order to prevent further infringement of the material at issue, we may replace or cease disabling access to the material that was removed if the material does not infringe on third-party copyright. The decision to re-post any material is at TikTok’s sole discretion. 

  

**Trademark**
-------------

A trademark is a word, symbol, slogan, design, or combination of any of the foregoing that identifies the source of a product or service and distinguishes it from other products or services.

### **Trademark Infringement**

Trademark laws prohibit trademark infringement, which is generally the unauthorized use of a trademark or service mark in connection with goods or services in a way that is likely to cause confusion, deception or mistake about the source, origin, sponsorship or affiliation of the associated goods and/or services. 

At the same time, the use of another’s trademark for purposes of accurately referencing, lawfully commenting, criticizing, parodying, or reviewing the trademark owner’s products or services, or for purposes of comparing them to other products or services, where the mark is not used to designate the user’s own goods or services or those of a third party, is generally not considered a violation of our policies. Likewise, it is generally permissible to make a fan page about a brand, even without the brand’s permission, provided that you do not claim to speak for or be associated with the brand or otherwise violate the brand’s intellectual property rights. 

### **Removal of Content; Suspension or Termination of Account**

Any content that violate another’s trademark rights may be taken down. Repeat violations of trademark rights in connection with the use of the TikTok site or app, or other violations of the [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/en/terms-of-use) and [Community Guidelines](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines) may result in the suspension or termination of the user account. We reserve the right to refuse any account holder whose account was used for improper activities from opening a new account on TikTok’s site or app, or otherwise hosted by TikTok. 

### **Trademark Complaint and Notification**

Contacting the user directly may resolve your complaint more quickly and in a way that is more beneficial to you, the user, and our community. You may also file a [Trademark Infringement Report](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/Trademark).

All complaints should contain the information requested in our online Trademark Infringement Report form.  Failure to include necessary information may limit our ability to deal with your claims and may result in your complaint being denied.

Before submitting a notification, please be aware that intentionally submitting a misleading or fraudulent report may lead to liability for damages under laws as may be applicable in some countries.
