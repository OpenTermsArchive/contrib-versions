Information we collect
----------------------

We collect information about you when you provide it to us, when you use our Services, and from other sources, as further described below.

**Information you provide**

We collect information about you when you input it into the Services or otherwise provide it directly to us. This includes the following categories of information:   

_**Account Information and Profile Information:**_ We collect information when you register for an account, create or modify your profile, set preferences, sign up for or make purchases through the Services. For example, you provide contact information (e.g., name or email address) and, in some cases, billing information (e.g., billing address, email address or name), when you register for the Services. You also have options to add a display name, profile photo, job title, and other details to your profile. We also keep track of your preferences when you select settings within the Services.

You may also provide information to us when you integrate or link a third-party service with our Services. For example, if you create an account or log into the Services using your Google credentials, we receive your name and email address as permitted by your Google profile settings in order to authenticate you. The information we receive when you link or integrate our Services with a third-party service depends on the settings, permissions and privacy policy controlled by that third-party service. You should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand what information may be disclosed to us or shared with our Services.

**_Content you provide through our products:_** The Services include the Atlassian products you use, where we collect and store content that you post, send, receive and share. We process this content in the role of a processor or service provider on behalf of our customers; this privacy policy does not apply to that processing (see above for more information).

**_Content you provide through our websites:_** The Services also include websites owned or operated by us. We collect content that you submit to these websites, which include social media or social networking websites operated by us, our support and documentation websites, our Community Forums, and our Marketplace. For example, you provide content to us when you provide feedback, directly to us through our Services or otherwise, or when you participate in any interactive features, surveys, contests, promotions, sweepstakes, activities or events.  

**_Information you provide through our support channels:_** The Services also include customer support, where you may submit inquiries or other information regarding a problem you are experiencing with a Service. Whether you designate yourself as a technical contact, open a support ticket, speak to one of our representatives directly or otherwise engage with our support team or support features, you will be asked to provide contact information, a summary or description of the problem you are experiencing, and any other documentation, screenshots or information that would be helpful in resolving the issue and/or a Support Entitlement Number (SEN).

**_Payment Information:_**  We collect payment and billing information when you register for certain paid Services. For example, we ask you to designate a billing representative, including name and contact information, upon registration. You might also provide payment information, such as payment card details, which we collect via secure payment processing services.

**Information we collect automatically**

We automatically collect information about you when you use our Services, including browsing our websites and taking certain actions within the Services. Information may also be collected about how you interact with and use features in our software products. This includes the following categories of information:         

_**Your use of the Services:**_ We collect information about your use, operation, and interaction with any of our Services, including when you connect third party services to or use those services with ours. This information includes, for example, the features you use, the actions you perform, the links you click on; the type, size and filenames of attachments you upload to the Services; search terms; the number of words in a Jira ticket or @ mentions in a comment; the type of Loom videos you created and the number of views on your videos; and how you interact with others on the Services. We also collect information about the teams and people you work with and how you work with them, like who you collaborate with and communicate with most frequently. Administrators may enable our collection of this information from software products.

_**Device and Connection Information:**_ We collect information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other devices you use to access the Services. This device information includes your connection type and settings when you install, access, update, or use our Services. We also collect information through your device about your operating system, browser type, IP address, URLs of referring/exit pages, device identifiers, and diagnostic and crash data. We use your IP address and/or country preference to approximate your location to provide you with a better Service experience. How much of this information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services. 

_**Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies:**_ Atlassian and our third-party partners, such as our advertising and analytics partners, use cookies and other tracking technologies (e.g., web beacons, device identifiers and pixels) to provide functionality, to recognize you across different Services and devices, or to demonstrate that certain content was viewed or clicked. For more information, please see our [Cookies & Tracking Notice](https://www.atlassian.com/legal/cookies), which includes information on how to control or opt out of these cookies and tracking technologies.

**Information from other sources**

We also receive information about you from other Service users, our related companies, our business and channel partners, and third-party providers, including from social media platforms and public databases. We may combine this information with information we collect through other means described above. This helps us, for example, to update and improve our records, provide and improve our Services, identify new customers, create more personalized advertising, and suggest services that may be of interest to you. This includes information collected from the following sources:

_**Other users of the Services:**_ We receive your email address from other Service users when they provide it in order to invite you to the Services. Similarly, an administrator may provide your contact information when they designate you as the billing or technical contact on your company's account or when they designate you as an administrator. 

_**Atlassian Companies:**_ We receive information about you from other Atlassian corporate affiliates, in accordance with their terms and policies. 

_**Atlassian Partners:**_ We work with a [global network of partners](https://www.atlassian.com/partners) who provide consulting, implementation, training and other services around our products. Some of these partners also help us to market and promote our Services, generate leads for us, and resell our Services. We receive information about you and your activities on and off the Services from these partners, such as billing information, billing and technical contact information, company name, what Atlassian Services you have purchased or may be interested in, evaluation information you have provided, what events you have attended, what country you are in, and information about your interest in and engagement with our Services and online advertisements.

_**Third-Party Providers:**_ We may receive information about you from third-party providers of business and security information and from publicly available sources (e.g., social media platforms), including physical mail addresses, job titles, email addresses, phone numbers, intent data (or user behavior data), IP addresses and social media profiles.

How we use information
----------------------

How we use the information we collect depends on which Services you use, how you use them, and any preferences you have communicated to us. We use information for the following purposes:

_**To provide the Services and personalize your experience:**_ We use information about you to provide the Services to you, including to process transactions, authenticate you when you log in, provide customer support, and operate, maintain, and improve the Services. We may use your email domain to infer your affiliation with a particular organization or industry to personalize the content and experience you receive on our websites. Based on your interactions with different Atlassian products, third-party services you link or install, and advertisements, we will personalize your experience and tailor our communications, recommendations and offers to you.

_**To develop and improve our Services:**_ We are always looking for ways to make our Services smarter, faster, secure, integrated, and useful. We use information and collective learnings (including feedback) about how people use our Services to troubleshoot, to identify trends, usage, activity patterns and areas for integration, to improve our Services and to develop new products, features and technologies that benefit our users and the public. For example, to improve the @mention feature, we automatically analyze recent interactions among users and how often they @mention one another to surface the most relevant connections for users, or we might analyze Marketplace search terms to improve the accuracy and relevance of suggested apps returned when you use the search feature. In some cases, we apply these learnings across our Services to improve and develop similar features, to better integrate the Services you use, or to provide you with insights based on how others use our Services. We also test and analyze certain new features with some users before rolling the feature out to all users.  

_**To communicate with you about the Services:**_ We use your contact information to send transactional communications via email and within the Services, including confirming your purchases, reminding you of subscription expirations, responding to your comments, questions and requests, and providing customer support. We also provide tailored communications based on your activity and interactions with us, and we may contact you regarding product feedback. If an opt out is available, you will find that option within the communication itself or in your account settings.

_**To conduct marketing and promotional activities:**_ We use information about you and how you use the Services for analysis, research and communications relating to marketing (including targeted advertising of products that may interest you), promotional activities, and business development. We may use your contact information and information about how you use the Services to send promotional communications that may be of specific interest to you, including by email and by displaying Atlassian ads on other companies' websites and applications. These communications may be informed by, for example, your interactions (like counting ad impressions), and are aimed at driving engagement and maximizing what you get out of the Services, including information about new features, survey requests, newsletters, and events we think may be of interest to you. We also communicate with you about new Services, product offers, promotions, and contests. You can control whether you receive these communications as described below at “[How to access and control your information](https://www.atlassian.com/legal/privacy-policy#how-to-access-and-control-your-information)” under "Opt-out of communications."

_**To provide customer support:**_ We use your information to resolve technical issues you encounter, to respond to your requests for assistance, to analyze crash information, and to repair and improve the Services, including for development, training, or fine-tuning of machine learning and artificial intelligence models. We may also use generative artificial intelligence in responding to your support related requests. Where you give us express permission to do so, we may disclose information to a third-party expert for the purpose of responding to support-related requests.

_**To maintain Service safety and security:**_ We use information about you and your use of the Services to verify accounts and activity, to detect, prevent, and respond to potential or actual security incidents, and to monitor and protect against other malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, illegal or inappropriate activity, including violations of Service policies. Detection and response may leverage generative artificial intelligence or machine learning tools.

_**To protect our legitimate business interests and legal rights:**_ Where required by law or where we believe it is necessary to protect our legal rights and interests, or the legal rights or interests of others, we use information about you in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, and audit functions, and disclosures in connection with the acquisition, merger or sale of a business.  

_**With your consent:**_ We use information about you where you have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose not listed above. For example, we may publish testimonials or featured customer stories to promote the Services, with your permission.    

_**To aggregate or de-identify data**_: We may aggregate or de-identify your information collected through the Services so it can no longer be re-identified by us or another party. We may use and disclose aggregated or de-identified data for a number of purposes, including to develop and improve our Services and to conduct marketing and promotional activities. To the extent we aggregate any data originally based on personal information, we maintain and use such data in de-identified form and will not attempt to re-identify the data.

How we disclose information
---------------------------

We make collaboration tools, and we want them to work well for you. This means disclosing information through the Services and to certain third parties. We disclose information we collect in the ways discussed below.

**Disclosing to third parties**

We disclose information to third parties that help us operate, provide, improve, integrate, customize, support, and market our Services. All the above categories exclude text messaging originator opt-in data and consent. This information will not be shared with any third parties, excluding aggregators and providers of the text messaging services.

_**Service Providers:**_ We work with third-party service providers to provide website and application development, hosting, maintenance, backup, storage, virtual infrastructure, payment processing, analysis, marketing, and other services for us, which may require them to access or use information about you. If a service provider needs to access information about you to perform services on our behalf, they do so under close instruction from us, including appropriate security and confidentiality procedures designed to protect your information.

_**Atlassian Partners:**_ We work with a [global network of partners](https://www.atlassian.com/partners) who provide consulting, implementation, training and other services around our products. We may disclose your information to these third parties in connection with their services, such as to assist with billing and collections, to provide localized support, and to provide customizations. We may also disclose information to these third parties where you have agreed to that disclosure.

_**Third-Party Services:**_ You, your administrator or other Service users may choose to add new functionality or change the behavior of the Services by installing or connecting third-party services. Doing so may give third-party services access to your account and information about you, like your name and email address. When you intentionally interact with such third-party services, we may disclose certain information to those third parties or receive information from those third parties, consistent with your privacy settings on the third-party service. If you purchase or install a third-party service using Atlassian Marketplace, we will also disclose Order information to the third party in accordance with the [Atlassian Marketplace Terms of Use](https://www.atlassian.com/licensing/marketplace/termsofuse#data-collection-and-sharing). Third-party service policies and procedures are not controlled by us, and this privacy policy does not cover how third-party services use your information. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of third parties before connecting to or using their applications or services to learn more about their privacy and information handling practices. If you object to information about you being disclosed to these third parties, please do not install or connect the third-party service.

_**Links to Third-Party Sites:**_ The Services may include links that direct you to other websites or services whose privacy practices may differ from ours. If you submit information to any of those third-party sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.

_**Third-Party Widgets:**_ Some of our services contain widgets and social media features, such as the Twitter "tweet" button or Facebook "like" button. These widgets and features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on the Services, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Widgets and social media features are either hosted by a third-party or hosted directly on our Services. You should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand how those third-parties may use your information. 

_**With your consent:**_ We may also disclose information about you to third parties when you give us consent to do so. For example, we often display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our public websites. With your consent, we may post your name alongside the testimonial.  

_**Compliance with Enforcement Requests and Applicable Laws; Enforcement of Our Terms and Policies; Enforcement of Our Rights:**_ We may disclose information about you to government authorities, law enforcement, or industry peers if we believe that sharing is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, or legal obligation, (b) enforce the terms of our agreements and our policies, (c) protect the security or integrity of our products and services, (d) protect Atlassian, our customers or the public from harm or illegal activities, or (e) respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing the death or serious bodily injury of any person. For more information on how we respond to government requests, see our [Guidelines for Law Enforcement](https://www.atlassian.com/trust/privacy/guidelines-for-law-enforcement) and our [Transparency Report](https://www.atlassian.com/trust/privacy/transparency-report).

**Disclosing to affiliated companies**

We disclose information we collect to affiliated companies and, in some cases, to prospective affiliates. Affiliated companies are companies owned or operated by us. The protections of this privacy policy apply to the information we disclose in these circumstances.

_**Atlassian companies:**_ We disclose information to other Atlassian corporate affiliates in order to operate, maintain, and improve the Services, and to offer you other Atlassian affiliated services. This includes companies that own or operate the Services.

_**Business Transfers:**_ We may disclose or transfer information we collect under this privacy policy in connection with any merger, sale of company assets, financing, reorganization, dissolution, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on the Services if a transaction takes place, as well as any choices you may have regarding your information.

**Disclosing to other Service users**

When you use the Services, we disclose certain information about you to other Service users.

_**Managed accounts and administrators:**_ If you register or access the Services using an email address with a domain that is owned by your employer or organization, or associate that email address with your existing account, and such organization wishes to establish an account or site, certain information about you, including your name, profile picture, contact info, content and past use of your account may become accessible to that organization’s administrator and other Service users sharing the same domain. If you are an administrator for a particular site or group of users within the Services, we may disclose your contact information to current or past Service users, for the purpose of facilitating Service-related requests.  

_**Community Forums:**_ Our websites offer publicly accessible blogs, forums, issue trackers, and wikis (e.g., [Atlassian Community](https://community.atlassian.com/), [Atlassian Developer Community](http://community.developer.atlassian.com/), [Trello Community](https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Trello/ct-p/trello), and [Trello Inspiration](https://trello.com/inspiration)). You should be aware that any information you provide on these websites - including profile information associated with the account you use to post the information - may be read, collected, and used by any member of the public who accesses these websites.  Your posts and certain profile information may remain even after you terminate your account. We urge you to consider the sensitivity of any information you input into these Services. To request removal of your information from publicly accessible websites operated by us, please contact us as provided below. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to and why.

How we store and secure information
-----------------------------------

We use industry standard technical and organizational measures to secure the information we store. For more information on where and how we store your information, please see the [Atlassian Trust Center.](https://www.atlassian.com/trust)

While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others.

How long we keep information
----------------------------

How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, the purposes for which it was collected, applicable legal or regulatory requirements, and user expectations and preferences. After such time, we will either delete or de-identify your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.  

_**Account information:**_ We retain your account information for as long as your account is active and a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the Services. We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where we retain information to develop and improve our Services, we take steps to de-identify the information.  

_**Information you share on the Services:**_ If your account is deactivated or disabled, some of your information and the content you have provided will remain in order to allow your team members or other users to make full use of the Services. For example, we continue to display messages you sent to the users that received them and continue to display content you provided. 

_**Managed accounts:**_ If the Services are made available to you through an organization (e.g., your employer), we retain your information as long as required by the administrator of your account. For more information, see "Managed accounts and administrators" at the “[How we disclose information](https://www.atlassian.com/legal/privacy-policy#how-we-disclose-information)” section.

_**Marketing information:**_ If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences for a reasonable period of time from the date you last expressed interest in our Services, such as when you last opened an email from us or ceased using your Atlassian account. We retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time from the date such information was created.

How to access and control your information
------------------------------------------

**Your Rights:**

Where applicable under local law, you may have certain rights with respect to your personal information. For more information about region-specific rights for residents of the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and the United States, please refer to the “[Regional disclosures](https://www.atlassian.com/legal/privacy-policy#regional-disclosures)” section.

Depending on which jurisdiction you live in, you may have the right to request information about our processing of your information, to request a copy of your information, to object to our use of your information (including for marketing purposes), to request the deletion or restriction of your information, to request your information in a structured, electronic format, to request to correct or update your information, to request that we transfer your information to a third party, and to request to opt out of certain disclosures of personal information and targeted advertising. 

In the “[Your choices](https://www.atlassian.com/legal/privacy-policy#your-choices)” section, we describe the tools and processes for making different requests associated with these rights. You can exercise some of the choices by logging into the Services and using settings available within the Services or your account. For all other requests, you may contact us as provided in the “[How to contact us](https://www.atlassian.com/legal/privacy-policy#how-to-contact-us)” section.

Your requests and choices may be limited in certain cases: for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we are required or permitted by law to retain. Where you have asked us to disclose data to third parties, for example, by installing third-party apps, you will need to contact those third-party service providers directly to have your information deleted or otherwise restricted. If you have unresolved concerns, you may have the right to complain to a data protection authority in the country where you live, where you work, or where you feel your rights were infringed.

**Your Choices:** 

You have certain choices available to you when it comes to your information. Below is a summary of those choices, how to exercise them and any limitations:

_**Access and update your information:**_ Our Services give you the ability to access and update certain information about you from within the Service. For example, you can access your profile information from your account and update your profile information within your profile settings (see [here](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/update-your-profile-and-visibility-settings/) for instructions on how to do this). You can also make a request to access information that Atlassian holds in relation to your account [here](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/access-your-personal-data/). If you don’t have an Atlassian account, you can make a request to access your information [here](https://www.atlassian.com/trust/privacy/gdpr/request-personal-data).

_**Delete your information, including your account:**_ Our Services give you the ability to delete certain information about you from within the Services. For example, you can remove certain profile information within your profile settings (see [here](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/update-your-profile-and-visibility-settings/) for instructions on how to do this). If you would like to delete your Atlassian account, see [here](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/delete-your-atlassian-account/) for more information. If you don’t have an Atlassian account, you can make a request to delete your information [here](https://www.atlassian.com/trust/privacy/gdpr/request-delete-personal-data). Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes, to complete transactions, or to comply with our legal obligations.   

_**Request that we stop using your information:**_ In some cases, you may ask us to stop accessing, storing, using and otherwise processing your information where you believe we don't have the appropriate rights to do so. For example, if you believe a Services account was created for you without your permission, or you are no longer an active user, you can request that we delete your account as provided in this privacy policy. Where you gave us consent to use your information for a limited purpose, you can contact us to withdraw that consent, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place at the time. If you object to information about you being disclosed to a third-party service, please disable the service.

_**Opt out of communications:**_ You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by using the unsubscribe link within each email, updating your email preferences within your Service account settings menu, or by contacting us as provided below to have your contact information removed from our promotional email list or registration database. Even after you opt out from receiving promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive transactional messages from us regarding our Services. Please note, you will continue to receive generic ads.

_**Opt out of targeted advertising:**_ Where applicable under local law, you may have the right to opt out of targeted advertising by clicking “Manage Preferences” and following the instructions. Where required, we also honor requests to opt out submitted via privacy preference signals recognized under applicable law, such as the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”). For more information on the GPC and how to use a browser or browser extension incorporating the GPC signal, see [Global Privacy Control — Take Control Of Your Privacy](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/). Relevant browser-based cookie controls are described in our [Cookies & Tracking Notice](https://www.atlassian.com/legal/cookies).

You may also be able to opt out of receiving personalized advertisements from other companies who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative or who subscribe to the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. For more information about this practice and to understand your options, please visit: [http://www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/), [http://optout.networkadvertising.org/](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/) and [http://www.youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/).

_**Data portability:**_ Data portability is the ability to obtain some of your information in a format you can move from one service provider to another (for instance, when you transfer your mobile phone number to another carrier). Depending on the context, this applies to some of your information, but not to all of your information. Should you request it, we will provide you with an electronic file of your basic account information and the information you create on the spaces under your sole control, like your personal Bitbucket repository.

Regional disclosures

Depending on where you live, you may have specific privacy rights that apply to you.

**European Economic Area and United Kingdom privacy disclosures**

If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom (UK), we collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable data protection laws. The legal bases depend on the Services you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your information only where:

*   We need it to provide you the Services and personalise your experience, provide customer support and to maintain Service safety and security;
*   It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as to develop and improve our Services, to conduct marketing and promotional activities and to protect our legal rights and interests;
*   You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; or
*   We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.

If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. Where we are using your information because we have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use, though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Services. 

The following chart identifies the applicable legal basis for each processing purpose:

_**International transfers:**_ We collect information globally and may transfer, process, and store your information outside of your country of residence, to wherever we or our third-party service providers operate for the purpose of providing you the Services. Whenever we transfer your information, we take steps to protect it.  

_**International transfers within the Atlassian Companies:**_ To facilitate our global operations, we transfer information globally and allow access to that information from countries in which the Atlassian owned or operated companies have operations for the purposes described in this privacy policy. These countries may not have equivalent privacy and data protection laws to the laws of your country. When we disclose information about you within and among Atlassian corporate affiliates, we make use of the Data Privacy Framework to receive personal data transfers from the European Union/European Economic Area to the U.S. (see the “Data Privacy Framework notice” section below), and the standard contractual data protection clauses (see [here](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2021/914/oj)), which have been approved by the European Commission, to safeguard the transfer of information we collect from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom (the "UK"), and Switzerland. Refer to [this page](https://www.atlassian.com/legal/data-transfer-impact-assessment) for a list of countries to which we regularly transfer personal data.

_**Data Privacy Framework notice:**_ On July 10, 2023, the European Commission’s adequacy decision for the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) entered into force.

Atlassian, Inc. and its U.S. subsidiaries (Atlassian Network Service, Inc., Dogwood Labs, Inc., AgileCraft LLC, Halp, Inc., Loom, Inc., Opsgenie, Inc., and Trello, Inc.) adhere to the Data Privacy Framework Principles regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data that is transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the U.S. 

Atlassian complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Atlassian has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF.  Atlassian has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/). 

In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, Atlassian commits to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF to TRUSTe, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit [Submit a Report - Watchdog](https://feedback-form.trustarc.com/watchdog/request)  for more information or to file a complaint. These dispute resolution services are provided at no cost to you.

The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Atlassian’s compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF.

For complaints regarding EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and Swiss-U.S. DPF compliance not resolved by any of the other DPF mechanisms, you have the possibility, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration. Further information can be found on the official DPF website: [Data Privacy Framework](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/). 

In certain situations, Atlassian may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. 

In the context of onward transfers, Atlassian is accountable for the processing of personal data it receives, under the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and Swiss-U.S. DPF and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Atlassian remains liable under the EU-U.S. DPF Principles, and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles if the Atlassian’s agent processes personal information in a manner inconsistent with the EU-U.S. DPF Principles, and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, unless the Atlassian proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to damage.
