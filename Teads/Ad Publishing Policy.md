### Environment and sustainability

We draw your attention to the fact that some countries have adopted legislation or created independent authorities to ensure self-regulation of the advertising sector with regard to the environment and sustainable development. We list here a few examples to illustrate this and direct you to the appropriate bodies.

**France:**  
In France the self-regulation authority operated by the industry is the Autorité de régulation professionnelle de la publicité ([ARPP](https://www.arpp.org/the-arpp/)). The ARPP can be consulted to validate that a specific Ad complies with [deontological rules](https://www.arpp.org/nous-consulter/regles/regles-de-deontologie/developpement-durable/). This is something that is only mandatory for TV and VoD ads.

In addition, several laws apply to advertising in France and more specifically to environmental claims. See this [list of legal resources](https://www.arpp.org/nous-consulter/regles/regles-de-droit/) from the ARPP.

Some laws are dedicated to specific sectors:

* Law 2020-105 of 10 February 2020, known as the “AGEC” law, expressly prohibited all-encompassing claims such as “biodegradable” or “environmentally friendly”.
* Automotive ads need to showcase a [standardized carbon emissions label](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/download/pdf?id=1Acbcyj7-Ii_D2boWgiQWet-kY10cdxfMgkK7daNs9c=) since december 2021.

Starting from the 1st of Jan 2023, all sectors need to comply with [rules](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jorf/id/JORFTEXT000045570611) regarding carbon offsetting and carbon neutrality claims in their messaging. These rules require to be able to justify these claims. Concretely it means that we can no longer have ads saying a product, a service or even a company is carbon neutral as they wouldn’t be able to justify it. Such neutrality claims should be avoided in the French market (and beyond for ethical reasons).

Additional resources to avoid greenwashing: [anti greenwashing guide](https://communication-responsable.ademe.fr/antigreenwashing) shared by the ADEME.

**UK**  
In the UK the self-regulation body is the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). The ASA applies the Advertising Codes, which are written by the Committees of Advertising Practice (CAP and BCAP), to advertising across all different types of media.

Resources:

* General Information on Climate Change and Environmental Claims – [Link](https://www.asa.org.uk/general/climate-change-and-environmental-claims.html)
* Advertising Guidance – misleading environmental claims and social responsibility – [Guide](https://www.asa.org.uk/static/d819e399-3cf9-44ea-942b82d5ecd6dff3/b142fdf6-ec36-4172-8b3321f3ebb9b53b/CAP-guidance-on-misleading-environmental-claims-and-social-responsibility.pdf)

For pre-publication advice on specific non-broadcast advertisements, consult the CAP Copy Advice team via their [online request form](https://www.asa.org.uk/advice-and-resources/bespoke-copy-advice.html).

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has also developed a [Green Claims Code](https://greenclaims.campaign.gov.uk/) – which sets out 6 key points to check your environmental claims are genuinely green.

**Belgium**  
In Belgium the [Association of Communication Companies](https://www.acc.be/tools-services/advertising-self-regulation-jep) (ACC) is the self-regulatory body. They published a specific [code for environmental](https://www.jep.be/sites/default/files/rule_reccommendation/milieu_fr.pdf) claims.

They also initiated the [Towards Zero Greenwashing](https://commtozero.be/en/guide-zero-greenwashing/) initiative detailing principles to apply and a guide.

The Jury for Ethical Practices in advertising ([JEP](https://www.jep.be/fr/)) can be [consulted](https://www.jep.be/fr/info-sur-la-procedure-davis) before a campaign is launched to proof an ad.

**USA**  
The FTC published in 2012 a [Guides for the Use of Environmental Marketing Claims](https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/federal_register_notices/guides-use-environmental-marketing-claims-green-guides/greenguidesfrn.pdf) (“Green Guides”). These guides are planned to evolve in the short term.
