Therefore, Webs takes no responsibility for any Content located in your Website and Webs has no obligation to monitor such Content or your Website. You are therefore responsible for the removal of any such Content that is in violation of these Terms of Service and ensuring compliance with these Terms of Service.

By visiting or becoming a Member of a Website created using our Services, you agree that the Content and information you provide during the registration process (including your email address) and other interactions with the Website may be accessed by the Website Creator and their authorized representatives and administrators, as well as any Application Developer whose Applications run on that Website. Similarly, by adding or using an Application or a service provided by one of our affiliates or business partners, you agree that the Content and information you or your Website Visitors or Members provide in the interactions with your Website as well as that Application or service may be accessed by the respective Application Developer, affiliate or business partner and their authorized representatives. We require Website Creators, Application Developers, affiliates and business partners to respect your privacy settings and our [Privacy Policy](https://www.webs.com/terms-of-service#privacy), but your agreement with that Website, Application, affiliate or business partner will control how they can use the Content and information shared with them. Be sure to understand the privacy settings, terms and privacy policies of that Website, Application or service prior to your interactions. Note that Webs cannot guarantee that such third parties will comply with their contractual requirements, and Webs does not assume any liability or responsibility for any third party's actions, or for enforcing any agreements such third parties may enter into with your or with us.

As a Website Creator, you and your authorized representatives and administrators will have access to the email address of the Members of your Website, along with certain information, Content and data provided or collected during their registration and use of your Website ("Website Member Data"). Webs may also provide you with access to certain Visitor data that we collect as part of our Services (collectively with Website Member Data and other data you collect, "User Data"). You agree to have a privacy policy or otherwise make it clear to your Visitors and Members what User Data you are going to use and how you will use, display or share that data. You further agree that, as between you and Webs, subject to this Agreement and each User's rights, (i) Webs owns all right, title and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the User Data collected by us, and (ii) you own all right, title and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the User Data collected by you. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order for Webs to run your Website on the Sites, you hereby grant Webs a nonexclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, sub-licensable, fully paid-up, royalty-free right and license to (i) use, reproduce, store, modify, create derivative works of, distribute, publicly perform and display the User Data on or through the Sites and in all current and future media in which the Services may be distributed; (ii) use and disclose the User Data and related metrics in an aggregate or other non-personally identifiable manner (including, for use in targeting advertising in a non-personally identifiable manner through and in connection with the Sites); and (iii) use User Data for other purposes permitted by the Webs Privacy Policy.

##### 5\. Your Obligation to Protect User Data

If you collect or have been provided access to User Data, you hereby agree not to use, display or share User Data in a manner inconsistent with the User's privacy settings, our Terms of Service and Guidelines, and all applicable laws and regulations. You hereby further agree that your use and disclosure of User Data shall be reasonably protective of each User's rights and in no event shall you observe standards of privacy and confidentiality in connection with the use and disclosure of User Data that are less stringent than the standards set forth in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.webs.com/terms-of-service#privacy). You agree to promptly delete all User Data (i) relating to any User who de-authorizes, disconnects or otherwise disassociates from your Website, Application or service, (ii) if we disable your Website, Application or service, or (iii) upon request by us or the User. Webs is not required to keep back-up copies of User Data on the Sites once the Website or User Data is deleted. Webs makes no guarantee that User Data will be safely stored on the Sites. To be safe, you should independently back-up User Data, to the extent permitted herein and applicable laws and regulations. You acknowledge that Webs may terminate the account of any User (including Members of your Website(s) or users of your Application) in accordance with this Agreement.

##### 6\. Proprietary Rights to Content

By displaying or publishing ("posting") any Content on or through the Services, you hereby grant to Webs a limited license to use, modify, publicly perform, publicly display, publish, reproduce, distribute, list information regarding, edit, translate, and make derivative works of such Content, in whole or in part, and in any form, media or technology, whether now known or hereafter developed for use solely in connection with the Services.

Without this license, Webs would be unable to provide the Services. The license you grant to Webs is non-exclusive (meaning you are free to license your Content to anyone else in addition to Webs), fully-paid and royalty-free (meaning that Webs is not required to pay you for the use on the Services of the Content that you post), transferable and sub-licensable (so that Webs is able to use its affiliates and subcontractors such as Internet content delivery networks to provide the Services), and worldwide (because the Internet and the Services are global in reach). Unless you have shared your Content with others, and they have not deleted it, this license will terminate at the time you remove your Content from the Services, but you understand and agree that your Content may continue to appear on the Sites or Websites after you remove it from the Services as portion of your Content may remain on pages cached by third parties, incorporated into RSS feeds, User profiles or other features, or archived on servers. Furthermore, when you publish any Content or information using the "everyone" or "public" settings, it means that everyone, including people off of the Sites, will have access to that information and we may not have control over what they do with it.

When you post any Content on a Website, you provide the Website Creator, other Members of that Website or the public in general with permission to view and use your Content depending on the Website's privacy settings and policies. Be sure to understand that Website's privacy settings and policies prior to posting your Content.

You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Services or otherwise have the right to grant the license set forth in this section, and (ii) the posting of your Content on or through the Services does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, intellectual property rights, contract rights or any other rights of any third party. You agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and any other monies owing any person by reason of any Content posted by you to or through the Services.

If a Website is removed from the Sites, the Content associated with that Website may also be deleted at the discretion of the Website Creator or Webs. We encourage you to be sure you are comfortable with this possibility before contributing your Content to a Website. You should be aware that Webs is not required and may not keep back-up copies of Content (including your Content) on the Sites once the Website or Content is deleted. Additionally, Webs makes no guarantee, either during or after the term of this Agreement, that your Content will be safely stored on the Sites and you should independently back-up your Content.

The Webs Services contain proprietary content that is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws in the United States and around the world (the "Webs Content"). Webs owns and retains all rights in the Webs Content and the Services. Webs hereby grants you a limited, freely revocable, non-sublicensable license to reproduce and display the Webs Content (excluding any software code) solely for your personal use in connection with using the Services. As between you and the Sites, all the intellectual property rights in the Webs technology, which does not include your Content, are owned by Webs or its licensors.

The Webs Services contain Content of Users and other Webs licensors. Except for Content posted by you, you may not copy, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, archive, transmit, distribute, perform, display, decompile, reverse engineer, attempt to access the source code, create derivative works from, rent or sell any Content appearing on or through the Services without permission of the Content owner.

We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions you may have about Webs, but you understand that we may use them without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no obligation to offer them).

You may not use the Services to post, disseminate or communicate any obscene, lewd, excessively violent, harassing, sexually explicit or otherwise objectionable subject matter.

If you become aware of misuse of the Services, please contact us by using this [form](https://www.webs.com/report-abuse).

Without assuming any obligation to do so, Webs may delete any Content or suspend any Website or account associated with it, that in the sole judgment of Webs violates this Agreement or that may be offensive or illegal, or violate the rights, harm, or threaten the safety of any person. Webs assumes no responsibility for monitoring the Services for inappropriate Content or conduct. If, at any time, Webs chooses, in its sole discretion, to monitor the Services, Webs nonetheless assumes no responsibility for the Content, no obligation to modify or remove any inappropriate Content, and no responsibility for the conduct of the User submitting any such Content.

You are solely responsible for the Content that you post on or through any of the Services, and any material or information that you transmit to other Users and for your interactions with other Users. Webs does not endorse and has no control over the Content. Content is not necessarily reviewed by Webs prior to posting and does not necessarily reflect the opinions or policies of Webs.

##### 9\. Anti-SPAM

### What is webspam?

Webspam consists of web pages that are created with the intent of manipulating search engines algorithms for the purpose of unnaturally ranking a website or websites for specific keywords or search terms, often with the aim of monetary gain.

**Webs takes spam and webspam seriously and will not tolerate spam or webspam in any of its forms. The following practices are NOT ALLOWED and are violations of Webs Terms of Service (ToS) agreement:**

**Content Spam:** Webs does not allow the populating of user sites or web pages with popular and monetizable search terms.  
**Link Spam:** Webs does not allow the creation of links to a page solely or primarily in order to increase its link-based score.  
**Automatically/Programmatically Generated Content:** Webs does not allow content that has been generated programmatically. Programmatic content consists of paragraphs of random text that makes no sense to the reader, but which may contain search keywords.  
**Keyword stuffing:** Webs does not allow the promotion of sites that use keyword stuffing, a technique where web pages are loaded with keywords to inflate the site's ranking.  
**Cloaking:** Webs does not allow the promotion of sites that use cloaking, a technique where different content is served to search engines than to users.  
**Sneaky JavaScript redirects:** Webs does not allow the promotion of sites that use sneaky Javascript redirects. Sneaky redirects are designed to deceive search engines or to display different content to human users than to search engines. It's a violation of Webs Terms of Service agreement to use JavaScript, a meta refresh, or other technologies to redirect a user to a different page with the intent to show the user a different page than a search engine crawler sees.  
**Doorway pages:** Webs does not allow the promotion of web pages that are created solely to rank high in search engine results for particular phrases, with the purpose of then sending users to a different page. In many cases, doorway pages are written to rank for a particular phrase and then funnel users to a single destination.  
**Trademark Content:** Webs does not allow the use of others' trademarks in the name, domain, subdomain or in linked headers of your website.  
**Hidden text or links:** Webs does not allow hiding text or links in your content to manipulate search engine rankings. This is considered deceptive and is a violation of Webs Terms of Service agreement.  
**Link Schemes:** Webs does not allow any links intended to manipulate a site's ranking in a search results page. User sites employing this tactic will be considered part of a link scheme and will be suspended. This includes any behavior that manipulates links to your site, or outgoing links from your site. Manipulating these links may affect the quality of search results, and as such is a violation of the Webs Terms of Service agreement.

When you sign up for a Webs account, you agree not to use the account to send spam, distribute viruses, or otherwise abuse the service. All users of Webs products, apps and services are subject to these agreements, which are part of the Webs Terms of Service agreement.

If Webs identifies a user who is violating this agreement, we reserve the right to immediately suspend the user. If the problem persists, we reserve the right to suspend the entire account and deny access to all the Webs products, apps and services. In such cases, we send a notification to the registered secondary email address for the website administrator.

If you identify a Webs user who is violating these agreements, you can report the abuse to Webs through our [Report Abuse](https://www.webs.com/report-abuse) section.

##### 10\. Webs Marks; Templates

Webs trademarks, logos, service marks, images, trade names and other distinctive branding features used in connection with the Services are the trademarks of Webs and may not be used without permission. Other trademarks that may appear on our Services are the property of their respective owners. Webs reserves the right to include within your Website applicable Webs copyright and trademark notices for Webs and links to our Terms of Service, Privacy Policy and other Guidelines. All notices and links will be displayed consistently in such form and placement as determined by Webs. For purposes of this Agreement, all templates offered by Webs are copyrighted material and are considered part of the Sites. Such templates are offered for use to Webs users under a limited license only, and are not offered for sale or unbridled use. Such license limits use of Webs templates to Websites hosted by Webs. Webs templates may not be transferred to or hosted on another web host or Internet Service Provider.

##### 11\. User Support

As a Website Creator, you are responsible for implementing and maintaining all support for your Website(s), including answering questions from your Members and Visitors. If you are a Website Creator and have any question with regards to your account, please visit our [Support Center](https://support.webs.com/) for answers to common questions or visit [this page to contact a member of our support team.](https://www.webs.com/help-and-contact)

##### 12\. Premium Service

Today, our Premium Services include various options for our Website Creators such as removing ads from your site, using your own domain name, removing Webs promotional links or images, and the addition of storage space and bandwidth. Current categories and prices of our Premium Services are described [here](https://www.webs.com/plans). All prices are subject to change from time to time. Webs may choose to temporarily change the fees for the Premium Services for promotional or new services, and such changes are immediately effective when Webs posts the temporary promotional event or new service on the Sites. Any changes to fees for Premium Services that are not temporary or promotional will be effective thirty (30) days after we provide you with notice by posting such changes on the Sites. The changes shall only apply prospectively to the Premium Services you've purchased. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in U.S. Dollars.

##### 13\. Other Paid Services

In addition to Premium Services, as a Website Creator you may purchase other paid services (collectively with Premium Services and Advanced Premium Services, the "Paid Services") which may be provided as a one-time transaction or recurring subscription in connection with an Application or as additional services. Such Paid Services may be provided solely by us or in collaboration with Application Developers, affiliates or business partners. You may be presented with additional terms related to a specific purchase before you confirm such transaction. Those additional terms will also govern that transaction.

Please note that if you enter into a transaction with a third-party, such as by purchasing an item through a Website hosted on the Sites, and have a dispute over the goods or services you purchased we have no liability for such goods or services. Although we may intervene in disputes between Users concerning payments, we have no obligation to do so.

##### 14\. Payments

You are responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with the Paid Services in a timely manner with a valid payment method. You authorize Webs to charge your credit card, charge card, debit card, PayPal, or financial institution account (herein "Payment Method") for all charges to your accounts with Webs. When you provide a Payment Method to us, you confirm that you are permitted to use that Payment Method. You also authorize us to collect and store it, along with other related transaction information. When you make a purchase, you authorize us (and our designated payment processor) to charge the full amount to the Payment Method you designate for the transaction. For Premium Services, we only offer recurring payments; therefore, you agree that Webs may automatically charge the fee to your Payment Method at the beginning of each recurring period. For example, if you choose a Premium Service with a monthly plan, you will be billed every month on the anniversary date of the date you clicked the "Purchase" button. Additionally, we may offer a pre-pay payment option for payment of Premium Services ("Pre-Payment Plan"). If you opt for a Pre-Payment Plan, your Payment Method will be charged the then-current fee for that Premium Service at the commencement of each renewal period. To help insure continuity of services and as a courtesy for members, if your renewal comes up after the date of expiration on your credit card, we will automatically update the date before attempting a renewal.

You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to Webs may be shared by Webs with third parties, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purpose of checking credit, effecting payment to Webs and servicing your account.

If you pay by credit or debit card we may obtain a pre-approval from the issuer of the card for an amount up to the amount of the purchase. We will bill your card at the time of purchase or shortly thereafter. If you cancel a transaction before completion, that pre-approval may result in your funds not otherwise being immediately available. If you pay by debit card and your payment results in an overdraft or other fee from your bank, you alone are responsible for that fee. You agree to pay Webs all charges incurred under your account for any Paid Service in which you or anyone else who uses your account (including children, family and friends) enroll in accordance with this Agreement and any applicable Paid Services terms. If your Payment Method fails or your account is past due, (a) you agree to pay all amounts due on your account upon demand and reimburse us for all reversals, charge-backs, claims, fees, fines, penalties and other liability incurred by us (including costs and related expenses) that were caused by or arising out of payments that you authorized or accepted, (b) Webs may collect fees owed using other collection mechanisms (this includes charging other payment methods on file with us) and (c) Webs reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your Premium Services or your account with Webs, including deletion of your Website from the Sites. Except as may be set forth herein, any fees charged to your account are non-refundable. You agree to submit any disputes regarding any charge to your account in writing to Webs within thirty (30) days of such charge, otherwise such dispute will be waived and such charge will be final and not subject to challenge.

##### 15\. Taxes

You are responsible for paying any governmental taxes imposed on your use of the Sites, including, but not limited to, sales, use, or value added taxes. If requested, you will promptly furnish to Webs the applicable receipts and/or certificates regarding such remittances as soon as reasonably practicable. To the extent that Webs is obligated to collect such taxes, the applicable tax will be added to your billing account.

##### 16\. Money-Back Guarantee

[Premium Services](https://www.webs.com/plans) include a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you are dissatisfied with your service for any reason, you will receive a full refund (minus domain name registration fee and overage charges) if you cancel your paid services within 30 days of the activation of your account. The 30-day money-back guarantee does NOT apply to domain name registration or other Paid Services. Once you purchase your domain name, you are its owner and it cannot be "returned."

##### 17\. Webs Credits; Credit Shop

You may purchase or earn credits on the Sites ("Webs Credits") that you may redeem to receive various goods and services through our online [credit shop](https://members.webs.com/s/credits/) ("Credit Shop"). Even though we may use terms like "purchase," "buy," "sell," and "order" to talk about transactions related to Webs Credits, we don't transfer an ownership interest in those items. Instead, those credits are licensed to you. Therefore, when you purchase or receive credits, you do not own the credits; rather, you receive a limited right to use such credits in connection with certain features and services on the Sites, such as the purchase of additional storage. Please note that purchases of Webs Credits are non-refundable, and you may not transfer or sell your Webs Credits to anyone. We may change the purchase price for Webs Credits at any time as well as the way that you can use or transfer the credits. We also reserve the right to stop issuing Webs Credits. Webs Credits are not redeemable for any sum of money or monetary value from us unless we agree otherwise in writing. If you leave a balance of Webs Credits unused for prolonged period of time, we may redeem those credits by giving you item(s) from the Credit Shop in equal value. If your account is cancelled or disabled, you will lose any accumulated credits.

##### 18\. Advertising on Websites

Unless you subscribe to a [Premium Service](https://www.webs.com/plans) (including domain purchases), we have the right to sell, run and/or serve third-party advertising on your Website. If you are a Website Creator, you may place any advertising on your Website other than Google AdSense. If you pay the Premium Service fees to remove our advertising, however, you may then place Google AdSense advertising on your Website. Webs may establish general policies and guidelines surrounding the running of your own ads ("Advertising Policies"). When adopted, any such Advertising Policies will be linked to, and incorporated by reference into, this Agreement and are subject to change from time to time. YOU AGREE THAT WEBS WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY SORT INCURRED AS THE RESULT OF ANY INTERACTIONS OR DEALINGS WITH ADVERTISERS OR AS THE RESULT OF THE PRESENCE OF SUCH ADVERTISERS ON YOUR WEBSITE. Webs reserves the right to include promotional links on Your Website(s) at no cost to Webs, unless you pay the applicable Premium Service fees to remove promotional links. Removal of promotional links does not include removal of required Webs legal notices and links to Webs Terms of Service, Privacy Policy and Guidelines or any statement indicating that Webs uses Webs ID for authentication upon sign in by your Website Members.

##### 19\. Webs Platform Policies

Webs reserves the right to disable or deactivate Member accounts that are inactive for more than 90 days. In the future, we may limit the number of free Websites a Website Creator can create and may impose different bandwidth, storage or other usage restrictions than currently offered. In addition:

*   You may not use profanity or others' trademarks in the name, domain or subdomain of your Website.
*   In order to run Google AdSense advertisements and/or remove advertisements or promotional content served by us on your Website, you must purchase a [Premium Service](https://www.webs.com/plans).
*   You may not edit or remove the Webs link at the bottom of your Website unless you purchase a Premium Service.
*   You may not do anything to remove, hide, or alter the appearance of advertising served on your Website by Webs.
*   The Webs ID link may not be edited and must be available in the Sign in and Sign up pages of your Website.
*   The Webs Terms of Service may not be edited and must be available in the Sign Up page of your Website.

##### 20\. Copyright Infringement

You may not post, modify, distribute, or reproduce in any way any copyrighted material, trademarks, or other proprietary information belonging to others without obtaining the prior written consent of the owner of such proprietary rights. It is our policy to respond to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 ("DMCA"). In addition, we will promptly terminate without notice the Membership privileges of those determined by us to be repeat infringers. If you are a copyright owner and you believe that any content hosted on the Sites infringes your copyrights, then you may submit a notification pursuant to the DMCA by providing our Copyright Agent with the following information in writing:
