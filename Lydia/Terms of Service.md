2\. Purpose of the Lydia T&Cs for Consumers \*
----------------------------------------------

These T&Cs, and the [Prices](https://lydia-app.com/fr/about/price?tab=price) and [Thresholds](https://lydia-app.com/fr/about/price?tab=limit) Appendices are used to inform the Consumer on the conditions applicable to:

*   Managing the Consumer's account (the "Consumer Account") associated with their payment accounts (the "Payment Account(s)");
*   The execution of payment orders;
*   All the services and products offered by Lydia (the "Service");

Certain related services may be subject to additional agreements that the Consumer will be asked to read and accept later if they want access to them.

By accepting these terms, the Consumer undertakes to use the Lydia Service in accordance with its purposes and under the conditions described in these Terms of Service for Consumers.

3\. Cessation of Lydia T&Cs for Consumers
-----------------------------------------

### At the initiative of the Consumer

**Withdrawal**

The Consumer may make use of their right of withdrawal within 14 (fourteen) calendar days of starting their membership of one of the paid services governed by these T&Cs, in accordance with article L.227-7 of the French Consumer Code, by sending a letter to the address indicated in Article 17 hereof.

The commencement of execution does not deprive the Consumer of the right of withdrawal. The Consumer will be required to pay the price corresponding to the use of the product for the period between the date of commencement of execution of these T&Cs and the date of withdrawal, to the exclusion of any other sum.

The Consumer must withdraw using the form attached to the last page of these T&Cs.

**Termination**

The Consumer is a Lydia member for an indefinite period.

The Consumer can terminate their Lydia membership at any time, and to this end request the closure of their Lydia Consumer Account by paying, if applicable, all sums due. The Consumer may also have the balance on their Payment Accounts transferred to a bank account opened in their name with a credit institution, as defined by article L.511-1 of the Monetary and Finance Code (Bank Account), prior to closing the Consumer Account.

To implement this, the Consumer shall contact Lydia Support by email at the address support@lydia-app.com. An email will be sent to them confirming the termination within 5 working days of receiving the termination request.

**Death of the Consumer**

The death of the Consumer ends their membership of the Lydia Service from the moment it is brought to the attention of Lydia. Transactions carried out from the deceased's Lydia Payment Accounts after the time of death are considered to be unauthorised, except with the agreement of the beneficiaries or the notary in charge of the succession. The Lydia Consumer Account is kept open for the time necessary to settle the succession and Lydia ensures the settlement of the balance with the agreement of the beneficiaries or the notary in charge of the succession.

If in the three years following the death of the Consumer the beneficiaries have not made themselves known or have not asserted their rights, the balance of the Payment Accounts of the deceased Consumer is paid to the Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations (Deposits and Consignments Fund).

### **At the initiative of Lydia**

Lydia may terminate the Consumer's access to the Service without charge by simple email notification after the expiration of a thirty calendar day notice period.

However, Lydia is exempt from respecting the notice period and may close the Lydia Consumer Account in immediately the event of seriously reprehensible behaviour by the Consumer (in particular if the Consumer refuses to provide information or provides false or inaccurate documents, or if they threaten or insult a Lydia employee), or they fail to comply with one of the obligations of these T&Cs for Consumers. In this case, the Consumer may be required to pay adjustment/file processing fees (see [Prices](https://lydia-app.com/fr/about/price) Appendix).

**Effect of termination \***

At the end of the termination and after settlement of the operations in progress, Lydia will close the Consumer Account and transfer the balance of the amount in the Lydia Payment Accounts, minus any costs relating to the Lydia Service, to the Consumer's Bank Account using the details previously provided to Lydia Support or stored in the application.

If the Consumer does not reclaim its funds, their Lydia Payment Account will be considered as inactive and subject to inactivity fees on the terms set here bellow (cf. Inactivity fees).

The closure results in the deactivation of the Lydia Service.

The closing of a Lydia Consumer Account is irrevocable and prevents the Consumer from opening another Lydia Consumer Account (at least for a period of one year or definitively in the event of violation of these T&Cs or legally reprehensible act).

**How Lydia works**

*   Have a United States permanent residence permit or spend a significant number of days in the United States each year (more than 183 days in the last three years including at least 31 days in the current year, subject to compliance with certain conditions).

It is up to the Consumer to provide written communication to Lydia of any change relating to their user circumstances for the Lydia Service (telephone number, address, email, modification of professional activity, etc.). The failure to notify Lydia of any change in circumstance cannot in any case create liability for Lydia for any harmful consequences to the Consumer, such as the blocking of the Consumer Account.

The Consumer can modify some of the personal data given when subscribing to the Service by following the instructions and providing any documents requested. This can be done either via the Lydia Application or Lydia Support, at support@lydia-app.com, or via a non-Lydia partner application that integrates all or part of the Lydia Service ("Partner Application").

The transfer or assignment of a Lydia Consumer Account to a third party is strictly prohibited.

In addition, the Service cannot be used by the Consumer for the purchase of goods or services relating to activities that are illegal or contrary to public order or morality, including in particular activities:

*   Whose nature is directly or indirectly threatening, insulting, defamatory, discriminatory, racist, xenophobic, homophobic or damages the honour or reputation of others;
*   That degrade or damage human dignity;
*   That incite the execution of an offence, a misdemeanour, a crime or an act of terrorism or that praise war crimes or crimes against humanity;

*   The sale of electronic cigarettes and tobacco and related or similar products;
*   Loans between individuals, including tontines;
*   Political associations ;
*   Cultual associations which are not legally incorporated and/or having controversial activities.

If the Consumer wishes to obtain more information, they can contact the support service at the email address support@lydia-app.com.

If the Lydia Service is used to purchase products or services resulting from such activities, the Consumer Account will be closed (see Cessation of Lydia Terms of Service for Consumers). In addition, the Consumer will be liable to a penalty (see [Prices](https://lydia-app.com/fr/about/price) Appendix) for non-compliance with these T&Cs, taken directly from their Lydia Payment Accounts before the closure of the Consumer Account.

Also, Lydia Payment Accounts are not intended to serve as a channel for cash flow between different accounts or payment means. "Round trip" transactions, particularly between a deferred debit account and an immediate debit account, constitute improper use of Lydia. In the event of repeated use of this type of operation, Lydia reserves the right to close the Lydia Consumer Account and/or levy a penalty (see [Prices](https://lydia-app.com/fr/about/price?tab=price) Appendix) for non-compliance with these T&Cs, taken directly from their Lydia Payment Accounts before closing the Consumer Account.

**Maintenance fees**

Consumer Accounts are denominated in euros per default. If Consumers want to denominate their account in another currency, additional fees are applicable. The amount of maintenance fees is detailed in the [Pricing Appendix](https://lydia-app.com/gb/about/price).

7\. How to obtain the Verified User status\*
--------------------------------------------

Consumers who reach certain limits, detailed in the [Limits](https://lydia-app.com/fr/about/price?tab=price) Appendix, must obtain the "Verified User" status before being able to continue using their Lydia Consumer Account.

The "Verified User" status also allows Consumers to access specific services (for example, issuing Internetcards).

The Consumer may therefore request this status at any time from the Application.

To obtain the "Verified User" status, the Consumer is requested to provide the following identity documents from the Consumer's Lydia Application or via the [Cagnotte website](https://cagnotte.me/gb):

*   A colour copy of a valid official identity document with a Machine Redable Zone (MRZ) and issued by a member state of the European Union, Monaco, Andorra or Switzerland (front and back of a national identity card, front and back of a residence permit, detail page of a passport, with a Visa issued by a European Union State Member for non-European Union citizens, or front of a driving licence in new European format);

Note: From 1 January 2014, the validity period of the national identity card has been increased from 10 to 15 years for adults (over 18). This extension of the validity period does not apply to persons who were minors at the time their national identity card was issued (article 10 of Decree No. 2013-1188 of 18 December 2013 relating to the duration of validity and conditions of issue and renewal of the national identity card).

AND

*   Creation of a "selfie video" during which the Consumer is required to orally clarify certain information.  
      
    Note: The "selfie video" must be recorded in an appropriate setting and attire.

 OR

*   Aggregation of a Bank Account opened with a financial institution operating in the European Union or the European Economic Area.

If the Consumer refuses to do a "seflie-video" or aggregate his bank account with the Application, he can opt for two of the following three additional vigilance measures: 

1.  Secure payment, by 3DS, with a bank card in the first and last names of the Consumer and linked to an account opened with a financial institution established in the European Union or the European Economic Area;
2.  Provision of a second colour copy of a valid official identity document issued by a Member State of the European Union and not yet provided;
3.  Provision of a proof of identity document:

*   Student card issued by a university or similar institution established in the European Economic Area,
*   Former version of the driving licence issued by a European Economic Area Member State.

Besides, 

*   If the Consumer is between 14 and 17 years of age or is placed under guardianship, curatorship or judicial protection, a dated and signed certificate from the legal representative, drawn up on plain paper, specifying that the Consumer acts under their supervision and with their agreement, accompanied by a colour copy of a valid official identity document of the legal representative.

The Consumer will also be requested to specify his residential address.

In the context of exceptional events, the Consumer can also obtain the "Verified User" status by a face-to-face verification of their identity with an authorised Lydia Agent. In this case, the Consumer presents their current identity document to the authorised Lydia Agent, who will check its validity. The Lydia Agent will take a copy and confirm the face-to-face meeting by sending an email.

8\. How Lydia works
-------------------

### **Step 1: Opening a Payment Account**

To benefit from the Service, the Consumer accepts the opening of at least one Payment Account when subscribing. Lydia sends the Consumer a message acknowledging receipt of their request and informing them of the opening of a Payment Account, under the conditions described in Article 17 hereof.

A Payment Account is denominated in Euros (€) and records the payment, collection and transfer operations carried out by or for the benefit of the Consumer. All Payment Accounts related to a Consumer Account are denominated in the same currency.

A Consumer can only issue or receive payments in the currency in which their Payment Accounts are denominated. Thus, if the Consumer's Bank Account is in a different currency to their Lydia Payment Accounts, its banking institution might charge conversion fees.

A Payment Account can never be used as a Bank account.

The balance of a Payment Account cannot be in debit.

### Step 2: Adding a payment method to the Consumer Account

Consumers can register a bank card, of which they are the holder, in the  Application in order to use it as a means of payment for payment transactions or to recharge one of their Payment accounts.

Lydia has set up a priority selection mechanism for bank cards issued by the CB group of bank cards. Consumers can override the automatic priority selection by choosing another brand from those displayed as "accepted" by Lydia (see [Lydia Manual> Accepted bank cards)](https://support.lydia-app.com/l/en/article/xjwfni0o3m-we-accept-the-following-bank-cards).

The deposit account agreement governing the bank card must authorise the transfer of funds by card. The Consumer then receives confirmation of the addition of a payment means under the conditions provided for in Article 17 "Method of communication between Lydia and the Consumer" > "Communicating with the Consumer".

The Consumer accepts that the data relating to their card is kept by Lydia's technical service providers in charge of debiting and managing user payment cards (service providers responsible for implementing the secure software and protocols required for registration, transmission and secure processing of card fund transfer orders), for the sole purpose of executing their payment transactions or recharging of their Payment Accounts.

### Step 3: Payment transaction

The Consumer can initiate a payment:

*   Either as part of a face-to-face payment with the Beneficiary, via a QR code or via Bluetooth (if device is compatible);
*   Or as part of a remote payment:

*   With the Lydia Application, by selecting the payment beneficiary from the contacts in their directory (which implies that the Consumer has agreed to link the contact directory to the Lydia application) or by entering their telephone number, email address or IBAN number;
*   With the Lydia Application, by accepting a request for payment issued by another Private or Professional Consumer using the Lydia PRO Service;
*   With a bank card, outside the Lydia Application, by performing a payment transaction through a CB Form offered by a Private or Professional Consumer using the Lydia PRO Service.

The payment means (Lydia balance, bank card or Bank Account) of the paying Consumer is debited immediately and the Beneficiary's Payment Account, if the latter has a Lydia Consumer Account, is credited upon receipt of confirmation from the Lydia technical service provider in charge of debiting the payment method. The transaction cannot be cancelled either by the payer or by Lydia. Only the beneficiary can, by whatever means, return the funds to the payer (see 15. The responsibility of the Consumer > Final payment order).

Unless the Consumer directly enters the IBAN of the Beneficiary, if the beneficiary does not hold a Lydia Consumer Account, they then receive an SMS or an email inviting them to install the Lydia application or to perform a transfer to their Bank Account by entering their IBAN within seven days. After this period, the transaction is cancelled and the payment means used is re-credited.

When consenting to the execution of a payment, the Consumer selects the payment means they wish to use to debit the funds. The operation can only be carried out if the selected payment means is linked to an account with sufficient funds.

An electronic transaction receipt is sent to the Consumer, under the conditions set out in Article 17 "Method of communication between Lydia and the Consumer" > "Communicating with the Consumer".

The Banking Partner may refuse a payment order. The Consumer will be informed of the reason for refusal the day following the refusal at the latest, unless a national or European provision prohibits it.

The Consumer is solely responsible for the payment transactions they issue. Once a transaction has been carried out and confirmed, the selected payment means is debited. Lydia cannot be held responsible in the event of an error made by the Consumer.

### Step 4: Receipt of funds (collection)

The funds are credited to the Beneficiary's Consumer Account instantly if the latter is a professional or is already a Consumer.

Otherwise, the Beneficiary is informed of the transaction by SMS or email and can receive funds within seven days:

*   By downloading the Lydia Application;
*   By making a transfer to the Bank Account of their choice. To do this, the Beneficiary provides their IBAN.

Otherwise, after seven days, the transaction is cancelled and the Consumer Account issuing the payment is re-credited.

### Step 5: Transferring funds to the Bank Account

Consumers can, if they wish, transfer all or part of their Lydia balance to the Bank Account of their choice, within the limits set out by the conditions in the [Pricing](https://lydia-app.com/gb/about/price) [and Limits Appendices](https://lydia-app.com/gb/about/price). To do this, the Consumer is requested to provide the IBAN relating to the Bank Account to which they wish to make a transfer. This can be achieved by:

*   Aggregating their bank to the Application. In this case, they must accept the [Budget](https://lydia-app.com/fr/info/terms-budgea-bank-1.html) [](https://lydia-app.com/fr/info/terms-budgea-bank-1.html) [Insight General Conditions of Use](https://lydia-app.com/fr/info/terms-budgea-bank-1.html) (this functionality is only available in certain countries for Consumers with a local telephone number, for more information please read the [Manu](https://support.lydia-app.com/l/en/article/lcu8v7dbca-which-countries-are-eligible)[al](https://support.lydia-app.com/l/en/article/lcu8v7dbca-which-countries-are-eligible));
*   Directly entering their IBAN in the Application.

If the Consumer Account is blocked, they should refer to the section "How Lydia ensures the security of its Service".

9\. Other services and features offered by the Lydia app

### **Gift card**

Lydia offers the Customer the possibility to buy gift cards from a partner brand.

Before choosing the gift card, the Customer acknowledges and accepts the conditions of validity and use of the gift card specific to each brand. The choice of a gift card is final and may not give rise to an exchange or a refund in any form whatsoever from Lydia or its partners brands.

Lydia sends the Customer their gift card by email within the deadlines indicated. 

The offers are independent of Lydia, the brand publishing the gift card is solely responsible for ensuring its validity under the conditions indicated on it and previously accepted by the Customer.

Lydia does not pass the Customer’s personal data to the brand or to any third party. Only information concerning the use of the gift card and the beneficiary's profile can be used and shared with a third party in order for them to receive the most relevant offers.

The Organiser should go to the site [https://cagnotte.me/](https://cagnotte.me/), choose the name of the Money Pot and then create it. The Organiser must then choose a secure username and password.

The Organiser then receives a link via SMS. This link allows them to consult the transactions made on the Money Pot (see "Monitoring transactions carried out on the Money Pot").

The Organiser can create several Money Pots in parallel (see [Pricing and Limits](https://lydia-app.com/gb/about/price) [Appendi](https://lydia-app.com/gb/about/price)[ces](https://lydia-app.com/gb/about/price)).

##### **Inviting Participants**

The Organiser can provide the url link of their Money Pot by SMS, e-mail or any other means of communication such as social networks.

If the Money Pot has been created from the Application, they can also invite Participants by assigning them rights to the Money Pot (see Other services and features offered by the Lydia app > Shared accounts).

##### **Participating in the Money Pot**

Participants invited to contribute to a Money Pot are free to contribute the amount they want, either by credit card payment or, if they are Lydia Consumers, using the available balance on their Lydia payment account or by making a transfer via the Lydia application. The transfer must be in euros.

The Organiser is informed of a Contribution under the conditions provided by Article 17 ("Method of communication between Lydia and the Consumer" > "Communicating with the Consumer"). The contributions received are automatically accepted by the Organiser, beneficiary of the payment transaction.

A Contribution to the Money Pot cannot be cancelled. Only the Organiser can refund the payer.

##### **Ending the Money Pot**

The Organiser can freely define the period during which the Participants can contribute to the Money Pot. They can end it early at any time, especially when the target amount has been reached before expiration of the Money Pot.

##### **Clearing the Money Pot**

Once the Money Pot has been closed, the Organiser can:

*   Withdraw funds

The Organiser can :

*   transfer the funds to a bank account;
*   transfer the funds to their Lydia account;
*   transfer the funds to the Lydia account of a third party, if the Money Pot has been created from the Application;
*   convert the funds into a gift card (under the condition above).

If necessary, the Consumer can then make payment transactions with the funds transferred to their Lydia Account (see How Lydia works > Step 3: Payment transaction).

If the amount of the funds exceeds the limits indicated in the [Pricing](https://lydia-app.com/gb/about/price) [and](https://lydia-app.com/gb/about/price) [Limits](https://lydia-app.com/gb/about/price) [Appendices](https://lydia-app.com/gb/about/price), the Organiser must obtain a Verified Account in order to be able to withdraw the funds. The procedure to be followed is specified in the [Lydia T&Cs](https://lydia-app.com/gb/about/terms-of-service).

#### How is a Money Pot ended?

##### At the initiative of the Organiser

###### Termination

The Organiser may exercise their right of withdrawal within 14 calendar days of their acceptance of these conditions.

This right of withdrawal can no longer be exercised once a contribution has been made to the Money Pot.

Participants do not have a right of withdrawal.

###### Cancellation

Provided no contribution has been made to the Money Pot, the Organiser may terminate it without charge.

#### Monitoring operations carried out on the Money Pot

Operations related to a Money Pot are accessible in real time from the website [http://cagnotte.me](http://cagnotte.me/) or directly from the Application if the Consumer creates the Money Pot via the Application.

At the end of the Money Pot, the Organiser may ask Lydia Support to obtain a PDF format document summarising all contributions to the Money Pot.

10\. Monitoring operations carried out via the Lydia Consumer Account
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Consumers can monitor transactions relating to their Lydia Consumer Account (debits and credits) directly from the application. On request they can obtain a free transaction report in electronic format from Lydia Support at the email address [support@lydia-app.com](mailto:support@lydia-app.com).

Consumers are encouraged to check the information contained therein in order to assert their rights as soon as possible if necessary (see What to do in the event of unauthorised or incorrectly executed transactions).

**Security**
============

11\. What to do in case of loss or theft of the device linked to the Lydia Consumer Account
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As soon as they become aware of the loss, theft or any fraudulent use of the telephone or tablet on which the Lydia Application is installed, the Consumer should either:

*   If possible, connect to their Lydia Consumer Account from another phone/tablet and block their Consumer Account manually, from the Security section (4th tab > Security > Block my account). The Lydia Account Consumer will be temporarily blocked;
*   Request the blocking of their Consumer Account via Lydia Support, without delay, by sending an email to [support@lydia-app.com](mailto:support@lydia-app.com) or by phone on 01 82 88 11 69 (Monday to Friday from 9am to 7pm).

Lydia cannot be held responsible for the consequences of a blocking request which does not come from the Consumer.

The unblocking of the Lydia Consumer Account will take place after analysis by our services and in consultation with the Consumer.

12. What to do in the event of unauthorised or incorrectly executed transactions \*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Consumer must, without delay, notify Lydia of any unauthorised or incorrectly executed operations that they dispute by filling in the appropriate form, and at the latest within 13 (thirteen) months following the date of debit from their Consumer Account.

The dispute of said operations must be made by email or by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt to the addresses indicated in Article 17 hereof.

Once the legitimacy of the dispute has been established, Lydia will reimburse the Consumer, at the latest, on the working day following receipt of the dispute, except in the event of suspected fraud.

13. How Lydia ensures the security of its Service \*
----------------------------------------------------

### Protection of Consumer funds

The funds of the Consumer are deposited in an account opened with a credit institution in the name and on behalf of the SFPMEI. Thus confined, the funds benefit from the guarantee provided for in [article L312-4-1 of the Monetary and Financial Code](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006072026&idArticle=LEGIARTI000031076000), up to the amount of 100,000 Euros per Consumer (as provided for in [article 5 of the decree of 27 October 2015](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexteArticle.do;jsessionid=71DE0CCC077E89705E5C906515A1C69B.tplgfr21s_1?idArticle=LEGIARTI000031399062&cidTexte=LEGITEXT000031399043&dateTexte=20191018)).

### Identification through strong authentication

#### Accessing a Consumer Account

When subscribing to the Service, Consumers must register their identifiers on the Lydia Application. Consumers must register two identifiers, their email and their mobile phone number, associated with a password. The Consumer must take all the measures necessary to ensure the security of their tablet or mobile phone and their personalised security device. They must keep their personalised security devices absolutely secret and not communicate them to anyone.

To ensure that passwords are secure, they must respect a certain format. The identifiers allow the Consumer to login when the Application is opened for the first time, when the Application is disconnected and each time a connection is made with a new mobile device.

The combination of one of the two identifiers and the password constitutes the personalised security device made available to the Consumer by Lydia, which is specific to the Consumer and placed under their protection.

In certain cases, the use of the personalised security device is coupled with a single-use password, with the aim of performing strong authentication of the Consumer.

#### Performing an operation

When using the Application, the Consumer must register a four-digit personal security code. This code must be entered during recharging, payment and reimbursement operations carried out at the request of the Consumer, as well as when consulting sensitive payment information.

By entering and validating their personalised security device and confirming the transaction, the Consumer gives their definitive consent to the payment order. From this moment, the Consumer can no longer revoke their order. It is also at this moment that Lydia receives the execution order, except in the case of a face to face transfer, where the reception of the order occurs during the code scan by the beneficiary of the transfer (see Lydia user manual).

For more information on personalised security devices, the Consumer should consult the [Lydia Manual.](https://support.lydia-app.com/l/en)

Each time they register or enter their personal identifiers, the Consumer must ensure that their environment is secure.

Communications with the Service are made only through secure channels. Lydia does not, for example, ever request the provision of confidential data via a website. If the Consumer has a doubt about the legitimacy of a request relating to the provision of confidential data, it is recommended they do not provide this data and should contact Lydia support via the email address [support@lydia-app.com.](mailto:support@lydia-app.com)

### The fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism

In application of the provisions of [articles L.561-2 and subsequent of the Monetary and Financial Code](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do;jsessionid=827B477D4937A8D0F94FF1BC938A9EC2.tplgfr34s_1?idSectionTA=LEGISCTA000020196698&cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006072026&dateTexte=20200227) relating to the participation of financial organisations in the fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities, the Partners in their capacity as electronic money or payment service establishments and Lydia as PSP Agent, are bound by certain obligations.

They can carry out all the procedures necessary for the identification of the Consumer and the beneficiary. They can also obtain information from the Consumer about the purpose and origin of the funds received and their destination.

The Consumer undertakes to perform all due diligence to allow Lydia and the Partners to carry out a detailed examination of the operations, to inform them of any exceptional operation in relation to the operations usually recorded in their Consumer Account and to provide them with all document or information required.

The Consumer acknowledges that Lydia and its Partners may be required to set up surveillance systems with the aim of combating money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities.

The Consumer also recognises that Lydia and its Partners may issue reports to the competent authorities, voluntarily or on request.

The Consumer acknowledges that Lydia or its Partners may at any time terminate or postpone the opening of the Lydia Consumer Account, or the execution of an operation in the absence of sufficient information on its object or nature.

In this respect, no prosecution based on article [226-13 of the penal code](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006417945&cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070719&dateTexte=20020101) and no civil liability action can be brought against Lydia or its Partners, their managers or their employees who have in good faith made the declarations mentioned in articles [L.561-15 and subsequent of the Monetary and Financial Code.](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do?idSectionTA=LEGISCTA000033517859&cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006072026&dateTexte=20200227)

### When a Lydia Consumer Account may be blocked

**Passing limits**

As soon as an operation leads to the passing of one of the limits mentioned in the [Limits](https://lydia-app.com/fr/about/price?tab=price) Appendix in relation to the Verified User status and where, if applicable, the Consumer does not provide the information or documents necessary for the verification of their identity, Lydia will be unable to execute the transaction and the Lydia Consumer Account of the Consumer will be temporarily blocked.

The requested operation can be carried out as soon as the Consumer has provided the required documents and evidence and Lydia has verified said documents provided by the Consumer. The latter will then receive an email confirmation of the unblocking of their Consumer Account.

A Consumer can also be blocked if the amount of their transactions, singular or cumulative, exceeds certain ceilings within a given time (see [Pricing and Limits Appendi](https://lydia-app.com/gb/about/price)[ces](https://lydia-app.com/gb/about/price)). Exceeding these limits temporarily prevents operations from being carried out.

**Security measures**

Lydia may also block access to the Service and to the Lydia Consumer Account of the Consumer:

*   In the event of a suspected unauthorised or fraudulent transaction;
*   In the event of a significantly increased or proven risk that the paying Consumer is unable to fulfil their payment obligation;
*   If it turns out that the Consumer is in breach of these T&Cs, for example if they hold several Lydia Accounts.

When Lydia refuses to execute a transaction, the Consumer is immediately informed by email, as soon as possible and, in any event, within three working days of the refusal. Lydia also indicates to the Consumer:

*   The reasons for the refusal, unless prohibited by other community or national legislation;
*   In the event of a material error, the appropriate correction;
*   In case of insufficient funds, the need to recharge the Lydia Consumer Account.

To request the unlocking of their Lydia Consumer Account, the Consumer can contact Lydia Support at the following email address: [support@lydia-app.com](mailto:support@lydia-app.com).

**Rights & duties of the Lydia Consumer**
=========================================

14. The responsibility of the Consumer \*
-----------------------------------------

### Veracity of the personal information

On request, the Consumer undertakes to provide Lydia and its Partners all the information necessary to verify their identity and their transactions. The Consumer certifies the veracity of all the information they provide to Lydia or its Partners.

As a reminder, the use of false documents is punishable under articles [441-1 and subsequent of the Penal Code.](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006418753&cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070719&dateTexte=20020101) Consumers using false documents will be penalised by the closure of their Lydia Consumer Account and will be subject of a declaration to the relevant authorities.

In addition, any Consumer providing false information will be liable for the payment of a penalty (see [Pricing](https://lydia-app.com/gb/about/price) [and](https://lydia-app.com/gb/about/price) [Limits](https://lydia-app.com/gb/about/price) [Appendi](https://lydia-app.com/gb/about/price)[ces](https://lydia-app.com/gb/about/price)).

### Strictly Personal Consumer Account

A Lydia Consumer Account is strictly personal. The Consumer may not assign it, for a fee or free of charge, or lend it to a third party, including a relative, or dispose of it in any other way.

### Duty of vigilance

When the Consumer makes a payment transaction, whether face to face or remotely, they must ensure the identity of the recipient and verify the amount of the transaction.

Likewise, in the case of remote payment, on the Internet for example, the Consumer must be vigilant in ensuring that the payment platform used by the seller is secure.

Lydia and its Partners are not responsible for any loss due to a technical breakdown of the payment system if such is reported to the Consumer by a message on the device or in another visible manner.

### Normal use

The Consumer undertakes not to use their Lydia Payment Accounts for the purchase of services or products prohibited by law. In addition, the Consumer undertakes to make normal use of their Consumer Account and Payment Accounts in order to exclusively perform the operations for which the Application is intended.

### Credit Payment Account

Before each and every payment or withdrawal operation, the Consumer must systematically ensure that the balance of the Payment Account selected to support the operation is sufficient and available to be able to perform the operation and must stay that way until the operation is completed.

The Consumer undertakes to honour any payment order made with their Lydia Payment Accounts. The Consumer assumes sole responsibility for the consequences which may arise from an insufficient or unavailable bank balance.

The existence of a dispute between the Consumer and a third party, notably due to the non-conformity of an item or service sold, may not justify the refusal to honour a payment order.

All actual costs and expenses incurred for enforced recovery by writ of execution for operations are the responsibility of the Consumer.

**Rectification of a negative balance**

Theoretically, the Consumer Account balance cannot become negative (less than 0). However, the Consumer Account balance may become negative following certain events (cf. [Lydia Manual](https://support.lydia-app.com/l/fr/article/cn2pmndd7n-solde-lydia-negatif-paiement-carte-Lydia?vero_id=4814879)). If such a situation occurs, the Consumer should recharge his account. 

The Consumer will immediately be informed of the situation and should recharge his account without delay.

If the Consumer does not recharge his Account within a reasonable delay, the Consumer accepts that Lydia will debit the credit card or payment card connected to the Consumer Account up to the amount required to make the Consumer balance null.

Under the condition provided in the “Communicating with the Consumer” article, the Consumer will be informed of :

*   The amount debited ;
*   The credit or payment card concerned ;
*   The date of the debit.

The Consumer should make sure that the balance of the account connected to the credit or payment card concerned has sufficient funds.

The Consumer should contact Lydia support at support@lydia-app.com, before the scheduled date of debit if they wish to use another mean of payment. 

### Final payment order

Consumers cannot revoke their consent once their payment orders have been received by the beneficiary's service provider.

Consent to carry out a payment transaction is given by Consumers, before or after determining the amount, by:

*    Entering their confidential code on their phone or tablet;
*   Remote communication and/or confirmation of the data;
*   Communication or use of any personalised security data during a payment transaction;
*   Presenting and holding the smartphone or tablet in front of a device identifying the presence of "contactless" technology;
*   The use of a biometric recognition device (e.g. fingerprint sensor on the mobile phone).

When the Consumer provides their banking data as part of a series of payment transactions, they give their consent once for all transactions. The Consumer may however withdraw their consent no later than the working day preceding the execution of a transaction.

In all cases, any Consumer facing bankruptcy cannot revoke their consent to a payment order.

15. The responsibility of Lydia to Consumers \*
-----------------------------------------------

### Correct execution of payment orders

Lydia, in its role as a PSP Agent, is responsible vis-à-vis the Consumer for the proper execution of payment transactions ordered or received via the Service, namely:

*   Payment orders from the Payer's Bank Account to that of the beneficiary;
*   Payment orders between two Lydia accounts;
*   Transactions to or from a Lydia Payment Account.

In the event that Lydia incorrectly executes a transaction, Lydia shall immediately return the amount of the transaction concerned to the Consumer or shall correct the error and, if applicable, restore the Consumer Payment Account to the situation in which it would have been had the transaction not taken place.

In the event that the Consumer incorrectly executes a transaction, Lydia shall endeavour to retrace the transaction and shall report on the result of its search, at the request of the Consumer and without any liability for Lydia provided it has respected its obligation of means.

Apart from the exceptions described below, Lydia does not cover unauthorised operations carried out before the blocking request, excluding the deductible of 50 Euros payable by the Consumer, and with the exception of the cases provided for by [Article L.133-19 of the Monetary and Financial Code.](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000035430527&cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006072026&dateTexte=20180113)

Lydia does not assume any financial loss in the event of gross negligence of the obligations referred to herein or fraudulent acts on the part of the Consumer.

Lydia cannot be held responsible in the event of force majeure (an external, unpredictable and unavoidable event as defined by [article 1218 of the Civil Code](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000032041431&cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070721&dateTexte=20161001)).

### Professional secrecy

Transactions and personal data are covered by professional secrecy to which Lydia and its Partners are bound. However, to meet legal and regulatory obligations, Lydia and its Partners are sometimes required to communicate information to the legally empowered judicial or administrative authorities.

Lydia cannot be held liable for the direct and indirect consequences linked to measures imposed on it by legal or regulatory provisions, in particular the freezing of assets, which it may have to implement in the context of obligations enforced upon it by the public authorities, in particular in the fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism. As such, Lydia cannot be held responsible for any delays in execution that may be caused.

### Continuity of service and malfunctions

Lydia will make its best efforts to ensure the continuity of the Service. However, Lydia cannot be held liable with respect to the Consumer in the event of a malfunction, error or interruption of the Service as long as it has taken all the necessary measures at its disposal to remedy these malfunctions.

Consumers acknowledge that their access to the Service may be occasionally restricted to allow the correction of errors, maintenance or the introduction of new features or new services.

Consumers must ensure that their equipment is compatible with the Lydia Application and that they have installed the updates necessary for the proper functioning of the Service.

Lydia cannot be held responsible for malfunctions in networks over which it has no control.

16\. Lydia's use of Consumer personal information \*
----------------------------------------------------

Lydia attaches great importance to the protection and respect of privacy of its Consumers. For this reason, a [Personal Data Protection Policy](https://support.lydia-app.com/l/en/article/6ogzqxbjos-lydia-personal-data-protection-policy) has been put in place to show:

*   The way in which Lydia, as data controller, collects, uses and shares the personal data given directly by its Consumers and/or collected indirectly by Lydia during the use of the Service by Consumers;
*   The rights of Consumers over their personal data and how to exercise them.

By accepting these T&Cs, the Consumer acknowledges having read and accepts Lydia's [personal data protection policy.](https://support.lydia-app.com/l/en/article/6ogzqxbjos-lydia-personal-data-protection-policy)

In accordance with the legislation relating to the fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism, Lydia is required by the French legislator to keep the below items in transitional archiving (restricted access, transitional stage before deletion) for five years from the closing of the Consumer Accounts of its Consumers, or if no transaction is carried out for twenty-four consecutive months on a Lydia Consumer Account:

*   Documents relating to the identity of regular or occasional Consumers;
*   Documents and information relating to transactions made by Consumers.

For more information, the Consumer can refer to the [Lydia Personal Data Protection Policy](https://support.lydia-app.com/l/en/article/6ogzqxbjos-lydia-personal-data-protection-policy) and to that of its Partners:

*   [SFPMEI](https://www.sfpmei.com/confidentialite);
*   [Treezor](https://www.treezor.com/en/politique-confidentialite);
*   [Budget Insight](https://www.budget-insight.com/security).

17. Method of communication between Lydia and the Consumer \*
-------------------------------------------------------------

### Communicating with the Consumer

When Lydia wishes to pass information to the Consumer, it can use various communication means such as smartphone notifications, notifications in the app, emails or SMS. Consumers can at any time, via the 4th tab in the app, "Preferences", activate or deactivate certain means of communication or the communication of certain information.

### Contacting the Service to obtain information

The Lydia Support service is accessible :

*   By letter addressed to the Support Service at 14 avenue de l’Opéra 75001 Paris France;
*   By email to [support@lydia-app.com](mailto:support@lydia-app.com).

### Contacting the Service for claims

Any complaint relating to these Terms of Service for Consumers is to be made by the Consumer to the Lydia Claims Department at the following address:

*   Post: Service Réclamation, 14 avenue de l’Opéra, 75001 Paris France;
*   Email: [support@lydia-app.com](mailto:supportpro@lydia-app.com).

To help with the rapid processing of claims and with a view to perserve the environment, Lydia prefers to respond to claims by email or telephone rather than on paper.

The Consumer agrees to receive registered letters with electronic acknowledgment of receipt, as defined in article 100 of the Code des postes et des communications électroniques (Post and Electronic Communications Code). This sending will be preceded by an email from the service provider responsible for sending the letter, allowing the Consumer fifteen (15) days to refuse this means of communication.

In the event of a complaint and if no agreement is reached with the Claims Department, or in the absence of a response within fifteen working days, thirty five days if the response is beyond Lydia's control, the Consumer may take the matter to the competent court (see 17. Recourse in the event of litigation > Competent jurisdictions).

18. Intellectual property \*
----------------------------

Lydia grants the Consumer a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable and terminable right to use the Lydia mobile applications, APIs and website for the sole purposes of using the Service. The Consumer acknowledges that the mere use of these mobile applications, APIs and Lydia website does not allow them to claim intellectual property rights of any kind over them.

Lydia retains exclusive ownership of the rights attached to the Lydia mobile applications, APIs and website, as well as all of their content, including the names, brands, domain names, logos or other distinctive signs that it owns. Reproduction of these elements is only permitted for information or reproduction purposes for strictly private use.

19. Recourse in the event of litigation \*
------------------------------------------

Litigation between a User and a third party to Lydia
----------------------------------------------------

Lydia is not party to any dispute, even regarding the Service, between a Consumer or Money Pot User and a third party, Professional, Participant, Money Pot Organiser or even distributor of gift card.

**Burden of proof**

Proof of the operations carried out on the Payment Accounts by the Consumer is the responsibility of Lydia and results from the accounting entries of the latter, unless proven otherwise by any means provided by the Consumer who is responsible for keeping documentary evidence of transactions (statements of account).

**Applicable law**

The law applicable to these Terms of Service is French law. Only the English language version hereof is valid. Lydia and the Consumer agree to use English in their relationships.

**Amicable settlement of disputes**

For any dispute not resolved by making a complaint and relating to the management of a Consumer Account, to the execution, non-execution, interpretation, validity and termination of the application hereof, and before any legal action, Consumers are invited to make their complaint directly to the Mediator of the SFPMEI, by post, to the following address: M. le Médiateur de l'Association des Sociétés Financières 24 avenue de la Grande Armée, 75854 PARIS CEDEX 17 or via the website http://lemediateur.asf-france.com/.

**Competent jurisdictions**

In the absence of an amicable settlement, the competent courts are the French courts.

As a consumer, you will benefit from any mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which you are resident.  Nothing in these terms and conditions, including this agreement, affects your rights as a consumer to rely on such mandatory provisions of local law.

**WITHDRAWAL** **FORM**

In accordance with article [L.121-20-12 of the Consumer Code](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000022441302&cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006069565&dateTexte=20100703), I have a withdrawal period of 14 (fourteen) calendar days from subscription without cost or motive. This withdrawal is only valid if legibly addressed and completely filled out, before the expiry of the time period mentioned above, by post to the following address: 14 avenue de l’Opéra, 75001 Paris, France or to the email address [support@lydia-app.com.](mailto:support@lydia-app.com)
