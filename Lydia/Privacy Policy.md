### Article 4 : Purpose of processing and retention period of personal data

#### 1\. General provisions 

Lydia processes the categories of personal data referred to in Section 3 on a case-by-case basis  to meet different purposes or goals. Each of these categories is associated with a data retention  period after which the data is no longer used, archived and then anonymized and/or deleted. The  purposes that justify the processing of your personal data are the following: 

\- Management of the business relationship, the Lydia account and/or the products and services  subscribed to, in particular for evidential purposes. Your personal data may be kept for a period  of five (5) years from the end of the business relationship or, if applicable, from the end of any legal or collection proceedings and/or the expiration of applicable statutes of limitation.

\- The realization of opinion and satisfaction surveys and statistical studies. Your personal data may be kept for a period of three (3) years from the date of the study.  

\- The fight against fraud (e.g.: establishment of ratings or scores, detection of atypical  transactions). Your personal data may be kept for a maximum period of five (5) years from the  closing of the file of proven fraud or the issuing of an alert in our systems. 

\- Compliance with Lydia's legal and regulatory obligations, including Know Your Customer  obligations, operational risk management (including computer network security, customer  protection, supervision and internal control, transaction security, and security in the use of  international payment networks) financial security obligations (anti-money laundering and antiterrorist financing obligations and obligations relating to sanctions and embargoes), obligations  relating to the determination of your tax status and compliance with related tax regulations, ethics  and anti-corruption; data protection and any other obligations relating to the management and  monitoring of compliance risks. Your personal data will be kept for a period of five (5) years as  from the generating event provided for by the regulations in force (e.g.: as regards activation,  loading and use of electronic money, five years as from the execution of these operations). 

\- Prevention and detection of criminal offences and/or taking legal action (e.g. for the  identification of seriously reprehensible behaviour or acts such as violence against Lydia staff).  Your personal data may be retained for a period of five (5) to twenty (20) years, depending on the  nature of the offence, from the date of its discovery. Where legal proceedings are initiated, the  data will be retained until the end of such proceedings and the expiration of any applicable statute  of limitations. 

\- The management of dormant accounts and data related to the search for the persons  concerned. Your data may be kept for a maximum period of thirty (30) years depending on the  cases provided for by the regulations in force. 

\- The recording of your conversations and communications with Lydia, regardless of the medium  (emails, letters, telephone conversations, etc.). Depending on applicable regulations, your  personal data may be retained for varying periods of time, but not longer than five (5) years from  the time of recording. The recording media or their reproduction will be kept for periods  proportionate to the purpose of the recording in question (from 6 months for staff training  purposes, to 5 years when the telephone recording is likely to be used as evidence). 

\- Accounting processing: accounting data may be kept for a period of ten (10) years in  accordance with the legal provisions in force. 

\- Cookies and other tracers. The life span of cookies is thirteen (13) months maximum.

\- Research or analytical activity for process improvement and model development purposes.  Your data may be used to improve our internal control procedures or to assist in risk and  compliance management. Data is retained for a specified period of time for each of these sub purposes. 

\- Commercial prospecting, the proposal of commercial offers adapted to your situation and your  consumption profile, the realization of promotional offers and games, commercial animations and  advertising campaigns. The data may be kept for a maximum of three (3) years from the end of  the commercial relationship or for prospects, from the last contact. This data may be anonymized  and aggregated in order to establish statistical reports. 

Your data collected and processed in accordance with the above-mentioned purposes may be  kept for an additional period of time if the defense of a right or interest so requires, or in order to  meet the requirements of French or European authorities such as the ACPR or the Autorité des  marchés financiers ("AMF"). In this case, your data will not be used for any other purpose, it will  be kept in intermediate storage and will only be accessible to authorized persons with a need to  know (e.g. legal department, compliance department, audit and inspection bodies). 

#### 2\. Specific provisions for remote identity verification 

In order to verify your identity at a distance and to comply with its legal and regulatory obligations  relating t o identification, verification of identity and knowledge of its customers, Lydia is required  to collect the following data directly from you: 

\- A color video of both sides of your official identity document (national identity card or European  passport or valid residence permit) and, 

\- An authentication video, i.e. a video of your face called a _"_video selfie"_,_ taken in color with the  front camera of your cell phone, of sufficient quality and brightness and without any digital  alteration (presence of filters). 

To do so, you must allow Lydia access to the microphone and the front and back cameras of your  cell phone, then film yourself for a few seconds and say a random phrase orally. The recorded  videos are viewed by one of our specially trained staff members for the purpose of authenticating  you. Once authenticated, the video is no longer accessible by our collaborator: it is automatically  stored in a semi-intermediate archive. 

Nota Bene: A specific technical processing of biometric data (as defined in Article 4.14 of the  GDPR), captured during the video of your face, is performed by Lydia for the purpose of verifying  your identity at a distance. This specific technical processing of facial images makes it possible to  confirm the unique identification of a customer based on his physical, physiological or behavioral  characteristics. It also allows the detection of the "living" character of the customer's face to verify  that it has not been physically or digitally altered. These biometric data are considered sensitive  in the sense of the GDPR. In order to use this processing in accordance with Article 9 of the GDPR, we justify a specific need to identify our customers to allow access to our services, under  the control of the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés (known as _"CNIL")._ 

You are always free to choose whether or not to make an authentication video. You can choose  to perform the alternative identity verification process offered by Lydia, without any additional  constraints, incentives or compensation.

#### 3\. Specific provisions for requests deemed sensitive 

Lydia may ask you to take an authentication video (a video selfie of your face_)_ in order to allow  you to make requests, deemed sensitive, relating to the modification of your security data and or  during the process of recovering access to your Lydia account (e.g., forgetting your password,  changing your phone number, or blocking your account). 

To do so, you must allow Lydia access to the microphone and the front and back cameras of your  cell phone, then film yourself for a few seconds and verbally state your request. The recorded  videos are viewed by one of our specially authorized staff members in order to authenticate you.  Once authenticated, the video is no longer accessible by our employee: it is automatically stored  in a semi-intermediate archive. No biometric processing of these images is performed by Lydia. 

You are always free to choose whether or not to make an authentication video. You can choose  to perform the alternative path for processing sensitive requests, proposed by Lydia, without any  additional constraint, incentive or special consideration. 

#### 4\. Specific provisions for profiling 

Lydia engages in profiling, which is the process of assessing certain aspects of its customers'  economic situation, personal preferences or interests, behavioral analysis, or location and  movements. 

These profiling processes have different purposes, mainly to secure your operations, to fight  against fraud, to personalize the relationship, for commercial prospecting or to better meet our  obligations relating to the management and monitoring of compliance risks. 

In the case of commercial prospecting, the processing consists in analyzing some of your data in  order to establish profiles that correspond to you. These profiles allow us to send you  personalized offers that are better adapted to your needs, expectations or situation. 

For each of these profiling processes, a thorough analysis is performed to determine whether the  processing should be based on your consent, Lydia's legitimate interest, or another legal basis  (performance of a contract, legal obligation). 

If profiling is based on your consent: we ensure that your consent is obtained, after having  informed you in an explicit and transparent manner about the use of your personal data. We also  allow you to withdraw your consent at any time. 

If the profiling is based on Lydia's legitimate interest: we will have conducted a prior analysis to  ensure, for each proposed processing, that your interests and fundamental rights are respected  and that you have a reasonable expectation that your data will be used in this context. We allow  you to object to such processing at any time, in accordance with the conditions set forth in the  regulations and in the manner described in Article 6. 

#### 5\. Specific provisions for fully automated decisions 

In cases where Lydia implements data processing involving fully automated decision-making,  including profiling, and producing legal effects you

We may also use your personal information to process data about you or that significantly affects  you on one of the following legal bases: your consent, the performance of a contract, Lydia's  legitimate interest or a legal obligation. Such processing is carried out in accordance with  applicable regulations and with appropriate safeguards. 

In the event that this profiling has legal consequences for you, you may request the  intervention of a human being, in particular in order to obtain a re-examination of your situation, to  express your own point of view, to obtain an explanation of the decision taken or to challenge the decision. 

#### 6\. Specific provisions for cookies and other tracers 

By cookies or other tracers, we mean tracers deposited and read, for example, when consulting a  website, reading an email, installing or using software or a mobile application, regardless of the  type of terminal used. 

You are informed that during your visits to our sites or when using one of our applications,  cookies and tracers may be installed on your terminal equipment. 

Where necessary, we obtain your consent prior to installing such cookies on your terminal  equipment and also when we access data stored on your equipment. 

For more information, you may review Lydia's Tracking and Cookie Usage Policy at any time. 

#### 7\. Specific provisions for access to your phone book and phone records 

Telephone conversations between you and our customer service departments (customer service,  compliance, anti-fraud, etc.) may be recorded for the purposes of staff training, evaluating or  improving the quality of our products and services, for evidence in the fight against fraud, money  laundering and the financing of terrorism, and for the purposes of verifying your identity in  connection with the exercise of your rights to your personal data. Before any recording, we inform  you and you have the right to object to it. 

Lydia allows you to link your cell phone's contact list to the Lydia application to find out which of  your contacts use our services as you do. To do this, we need to collect the numbers and email  addresses in your address book. We do not further process this data (only a fingerprint and not a  collection of raw data is done). This information is transmitted and stored encrypted, using a one 

way public key. You can disable this feature at any time in the Lydia application.

### Article 8 : Commercial prospecting

#### 1\. Commercial prospecting by email and automatic call machine 

If you are a natural person not acting for professional purposes, we may prospect you by email,  automatic call machine or SMS/MMS when you have given your consent at the time of the  collection of your email address or your personal details, or when you are already a customer  and the prospecting concerns products or services similar to those already subscribed. Each  commercial prospecting email contains a link allowing you to unsubscribe. 

If you are a natural person acting in a professional capacity, your email address may be used to  send you commercial prospecting by email for purposes related to your profession. You may at  any time exercise your right to object to commercial prospecting. 

Generic business addresses assigned to a legal entity (company) are not subject to the principles  of consent, prior information and the right to object. 

Messages and notifications related to the administrative management of a product or service  previously subscribed to (alerts, changes in contractual and pricing documentation, etc.) are not  considered commercial prospecting. 

The settings of the messages and notifications that you may receive from us can be made within  the framework of the subscribed service, it being understood that some of these notifications may  come under regulatory obligations and present an imperative character.

#### 2\. Telephone prospecting 

We may also have to prospect you by telephone. In accordance with Article L.223-2 of the  Consumer Code, you are informed that you can register on a list of opposition to telephone  canvassing Bloctel. However, despite this registration, we may contact you by telephone if there is an ongoing contractual relationship, unless you have previously objected or if you object at the  time of the call.

### Article 9 : Transfers outside the european economic area (5EEA)

The processing of your personal data by Lydia in accordance with the agreed purposes (see  Article 5) may involve transfers to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA), whose  personal data protection laws differ from those of the European Union. 

In particular, your personal data may, to the extent permitted by applicable regulations, be  communicated to official bodies and authorized administrative and judicial authorities of non-EEA  countries, in particular in the context of regulations on the fight against money laundering and the  financing of terrorism, international sanctions and embargoes, the fight against fraud and the  determination of your tax status. 

When personal data is transferred to countries outside the EEA, a precise and demanding legal  framework governs this transfer, in accordance with the applicable European regulations, in  particular by the signing of standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission.  In addition, appropriate security measures are put in place to ensure the protection of personal  data transferred outside the EEA. 

The standard contractual clauses are available on the CNIL website (www.cnil.fr). 

For more information regarding these international transfers of personal data, you may contact  Lydia's Data Protection Officer as described in Section 7 hereof.

### Article 10 : Security

Lydia takes all necessary physical, technical and organizational measures to protect the  confidentiality, integrity and availability of your personal data, including against loss, accidental  destruction, alteration and unauthorized access. 

Lydia also takes great care to maintain a high standard of security and confidentiality of your  personal data by educating our employees and business partners and training our employees on  data protection, by implementing content controls, by implementing tools and practices aimed at  obfuscation, anonymization, encryption and data wiping to ensure the protection of your personal  data from internal and external data leakage risks 

In case of violation of your personal data, presenting a risk for your rights and freedoms, we will  notify the CNIL within the regulatory deadline. In the event that this violation presents a high risk  to your rights and freedoms, we will promptly inform you of the nature of the violation and the steps taken to remedy it. 

### Article 11 : Lydia's status as host

Lydia hosts public communication areas that allow you to participate in discussion forums, instant  messaging systems or post content. These public communication areas are places over which  Lydia has no control and over which only you and other customers have control and can publish.  Therefore, Lydia cannot be considered as a content publisher but exclusively as a host whose  mission is to provide its customers with technical means to directly and permanently store  information intended to be communicated to the public. In this respect, Lydia complies with the  definition o f article 6.I.2 of the law n° 2004-575 of June 21, 2004 for confidence in the digital  economy ("**LCEN**"). 

Paragraph 5 of I of Article 6 of the LCEN states that: 

_"Knowledge of the disputed facts is presumed to have been acquired by the persons designated  in 2 (of article 6 I 2 of the LCEN, i.e. the hosts) when they are notified of the following elements:  the date of the notification; if the notifier is a natural person: his surname, first names, profession,  domicile, nationality, date and place of birth; if the applicant is a legal person: its form, name,  registered office and the body that legally represents it; the name and domicile of the addressee  or, if it is a legal person, its name and registered office; the description of the disputed facts and  their precise location; the reasons for which the content must be removed, including the legal  provisions and justifications of the facts; a copy of the correspondence addressed to the author or  publisher of the litigious information or activities requesting their interruption, removal or  modification, or the justification that the author or publisher could not be contacted. "._ 

Once Lydia has been notified of the allegedly illegal or indelicate nature of a content under the  conditions provided for in paragraph 5 of I of Article 6 of the LCEN indicated above, we will  promptly implement the necessary measures to ensure that the content is no longer accessible.  These measures may range from deletion of the content to temporary or permanent banning of  the content hosting service in view of the seriousness and repetition of the infringements found.  

Lydia also does not carry out general monitoring of content beyond assisting in the repression of, among other things, crimes against humanity, incitement to racial hatred and child pornography, incitement to violence, including incitement to violence against women, and offenses against  human dignity in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 7 of Article 6 of the LCEN.

### Article 12 : Cashback service

**12.1. General provisions**

Lydia collaborates, under mandate, with payment and electronic money institutions and account information service providers approved by the ACPR, all of which are jointly responsible for processing the personal data of Customers, in accordance with Article 26 of the GDPR. 

Thus, Lydia and these institutions jointly define the purposes and means of such processing. Customers' personal data are only shared with these joint controllers for the purpose of performing the contracts established with Lydia.

 The list of these service providers is set out below:

* Powens enables Lydia to provide its bank account aggregation and linked account information services to Customers. Powens Privacy Policy is available [here](https://www.powens.com/privacy-policy/). 
* Tink AB also allows Lydia to provide bank account aggregation services and information on linked accounts of Lydia Customers. Tink AB’s Privacy Policy can be found [here](https://tink.com/legal/privacy-and-security/).
* Treezor is a issuer of Lydia IBANs. Treezor's Privacy Policy can be found [here](https://www.treezor.com/fr/politique-de-confidentialite/). 

Lydia and these entities are bound by mutual disclosure obligations, including with respect to the following events: 

* Any breach of Customer personal data;
* Any use of a new sub-contractor processing Customer personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA) and on behalf of Lydia.

In the course of providing additional optional services, Lydia may also disclose your personal data to partners (such as BitPanda, PayLead and Floa). Please note that PayLead analyses your bank transaction data to provide you with personalised offers based on your transaction history and spending habits.

Lydia may also communicate the personal data of its Customers to one of its suppliers or partners, provided that these data have been anonymised beforehand. This anonymisation consists in removing the following elements: first and last name, email address, telephone number, postal address and any other element that would allow the Customer to be identified or contacted directly.

All personal data of Lydia's Customers are covered by professional secrecy under the conditions of Article L.511-33 of the Monetary and Financial Code.

These partners only have access to data that is strictly necessary for the performance of the contracts established with Lydia.

**12.2. Provisions specific to the cashback service**

To provide the Cashback Service, Lydia and its partner PayLead act as joint processors. 

PAYLEAD is a société par actions simplifiée (simplified joint stock company) whose registered office is located at 9 rue de Condé, 33064 Bordeaux (France), registered with the Registre du Commerce et des Sociétés (RCS) of Bordeaux under number B 821 725 579. 

PayLead and Lydia have jointly determined how the Cashback Service operates and how your personal data is used to provide that service.

PayLead also acts as an independent data controller for the further processing set forth in Section 1.

#### 1\. Purposes of Processing

The purposes for which we use your personal data and the legal basis for doing so are detailed in the table below. The operations carried out on the basis of the performance of the contract are essential for the provision of the Cashback Service.

PayLead also analyzes your bank transaction data to provide you with personalized offers based on your transaction history and spending habits. The eligibility criteria for the offers are defined by the retail partners and Lydia. 

The essence of the Cashback Service is thus to allow you to use your banking data to benefit from personalized and relevant offers from the partner companies.

**Further processing (in accordance with Article 13.3 of the GDPR)**

PayLead uses your personal data for the further processing described below. These further processing operations are carried out by PayLead on its own initiative and under its sole responsibility.

|     |     |     |

| **Security and services performance** | Operation, security and updating of Paylead's technical platforms | Legitimate interests |
| **Monitoring and improvement of servicest** | Creating aggregated and non-nominative statistics for monitoring the use and quality of Paylead services | Legitimate interests |

* The studies conducted by PayLead do not focus on an individual person, but on a set of aggregated and non-nominative data.
* PayLead's studies are based on pseudonymized data.

#### 2\. Personal data processed 

The following personal data are provided to PayLead by Lydia: 

* Name of your bank
* Bank transactions: transaction name, date, place, amount, merchant, truncated PAN number (last 4 digits)
* Unique user ID (token)

PayLead identifies you only through a unique user ID, called a "token", consisting of a series of numbers and letters. This is called pseudonymization.

Through the analysis of your banking data, PayLead also processes your consumption habits (your favorite brands, your favorite stores, the usual geographical areas of your purchases, your average basket), your average salary, your exceptional income or life events that can be deducted from your purchases (such as marriage, birth, etc).

As part of the support process, we process additional personal data of any kind that you may provide to us. Please limit the information shared to what is necessary, including what is required by us to respond to your request.

#### 3\. Retention Periods

Your personal data is used for a specific period of time, strictly limited to the purposes for which it was collected:

* Your bank transaction data is deleted after 2 years (from the transaction date) if it has not generated the payment of a cashback;
* Your transaction data is deleted after 5 years (from the transaction date) if it has generated the payment of a cashback.

When you decide to unsubscribe from the Cashback Service, PayLead will delete all of your personal data, except for data related to the payment of a Cashback, which will be retained for the 5-year period mentioned above.

#### 4\. Communication to third parties

Your personal data is only accessible to PayLead personnel who need to know it in order to perform their duties and provide the Cashback Service.

Certain third parties may have access to your pseudonymized (or anonymized where applicable) personal data:

* PayLead's possible subcontractors and service providers acting for technical and logistical reasons related to the proper performance of the Cashback Service (such as a payment service provider, external security auditors, etc);
* Partner Companies to whom PayLead communicates a record of transactions that have generated a cashback (amount, time stamp, truncated PAN if applicable).

#### 5\. Storage of personal data

Your personal data is hosted and processed by PAYLEAD exclusively in the European Union. However, PayLead reserves the right to use certain service providers outside the European Economic Area (EEA). In this event, PayLead will inform you of such transfers outside the EU and ensure that your personal data is properly protected in accordance with the requirements of the GDPR. Upon request, PayLead will provide you with a copy of the applicable safeguards.

#### 6\. Security Measures

PayLead uses technical and organizational measures that comply with legal and regulatory requirements to keep your personal data secure and confidential, including:

* pseudonymization of data: PayLead does not know your identity directly
* implementation of a policy for managing access rights to our tools and databases
* implementation of a logs policy
* data encryption
* anti-virus
* carrying out intrusion tests
* anonymization of data when possible
* training of PayLead employees in data security and privacy

Under written agreements, PayLead requires its service providers and subcontractors to implement strong security measures to protect the personal data they process on behalf of PayLead.
