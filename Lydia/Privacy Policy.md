#### 4\. INFORMATION LYDIA COLLECTS ABOUT ITS CLIENTS 

Lydia collects:

*   Information submitted directly by Clients to Lydia;
*   Information received indirectly when Clients use Lydia Services.

**4.1 Information Clients submit** 

*   Creating a Lydia account. When a Client creates a Lydia payment account, he/she provides Lydia with his/her mobile telephone number, first name, and surname. He/She may then provide other information such as his/her email addresses, a profile photo, as well setting a password and a secret question and answer in case he/she forgets his/her password.
*   Additional services. To access additional Lydia Services, the Client may provide Lydia with information about his/her payment cards, loyalty cards that he/she wishes to link to the Lydia app, and his/her bank account details. When creating a money pot, the Client may submit a title, a description, and a cover photo for the money pot created.
*   ID verification. To verify his/her identity and comply with regulation, Lydia may request copies of the Client’s official proof of identity, a complementary proof of identity, and a video of authentication).
*   Authentication video. The Client can make requests on his/her Lydia account and personal data in several ways (for example in case of forgotten password). If the request is considered sensitive and with the Client consent, it can be done by means of a video authentication. For this, the Client must give Lydia access to microphone and camera, and film himself / herself for a few seconds to state his/her request. The recorded videos are watched by an authorized Lydia Agent who authenticates the request. Once the request is authenticated, the video is no longer accessible by the Agent: it is kept in semi-intermediate archiving.

**4.2 Information Lydia receives indirectly about the Client whe he/she uses Lydia Services**

*   Additional personal information. When the Client provides Lydia with a proof of identity, Lydia collects information on the date of birth, place of birthand nationality.
*   Geolocalisation information. When the Client uses certain Lydia features, Lydia may receive information on the location, as determined by data like the IP address or the phone’s or computer’s GPS of the Client, in order to provide him/her with a better user experience and to enhance security (e.g. geolocalisation can act as check in the case of fraud). Most mobile phones let the Client control or disable usage of localisation services by apps within the device’s settings.
*   Usage information. Lydia receives information about Clients’ interactions with the Lydia app, such as content consulted, transactions made, or general use of the app (e.g. the date the Client added his/her payment card to the app).
*   Network and device data. Lydia automatically collects network and device data when the Client uses Lydia Services. This information includes his/her IP address, date and time of use of Lydia Services, data on his/her computer or mobile hardware, data linked to usage of his/her device, unique identifiers, crash analytics, or cookies.
*   Bank account details. When the Client links his/her bank account to the Lydia app, by providing the log-in details used for online banking, the IBAN number and payees linked to this account are automatically imported into the Lydia app to facilitate payments from his/her Lydia account to external saved accounts.
*   Contacts with Lydia. The Client can link his/her mobile phone address book to the Lydia app to see which of his/her contacts uses the Lydia app. To make the link between a contact in the Client’s phone list and someone who has just signed up to the app, Lydia collects the mobile numbers and email addresses in the Client’s address book. Lydia does not make any other use of this information. As Lydia only needs an imprint of this data, and not the raw data, this data is transferred and stored using encryption, by a unique public key. The Client can disable this feature in the Settings tab of the app.
*   Communication with the Lydia support team. Lydia keeps a record of communications that the Client may have with Lydia support team, e.g. email conversations, telephone calls, or a summary of telephone discussions.
*   Follow-ups of actions carried out by Lydia staff. Lydia staff may be involved in the management of the Clients’ Lydia account. In this instance, the actions performed are also stored in the form of comments (e.g. a Lydia account might be temporarily blocked in the case of suspected fraud).
*   Information about the bank account aggregation service. In the case where the Client uses the bank account aggregation service allowing him/her to aggregate his/her bank account(s) to the Lydia app, the data relating to this / these aggregated account(s) are collected by Lydia: name of the bank, types of bank account (current account, credit account, savings account), realized transactions and account's balance.

All of Clients’ personal data held by Lydia are protected and kept confidential in accordance with article L.511-33 of the monetary and financial code. Lydia Solutions may share Clients’ personal data with its Principals (SFPMEI ,Budget Insight and Treezor) and with its suppliers and operational service providers with whom Lydia is contractually tied, in order to provide certain services and process transactions, under condition that these third parties guarantee a sufficient level of protection of the data shared in compliance with article 561-7 II b of the monetary and financial code and in respect with the GDPR. These partners and service providers only have access to the data that is strictly necessary for the execution of the contracts established with Lydia Solutions.

Lydia may also share its Clients’ personal data to third party service providers or partners, under condition that these data are anonymised beforehand. Anonymising data means removing the following elements: phone number, address, and any other information that could identify the Client or allow him/her to be contacted directly.

Lydia stores its Clients personal data in the European Union. However, when a Client uses Lydia Services, his/her data may be transferred to another country, which may have less rigorous data protection laws that those in place in the country in which he/she live.

This is notably the case for data Lydia transfers to third party service providers operating outside of the European Union, especially in the United States of America. Lydia may use their services to reply to users’ enquiries, to moderate photographs published on Lydia platforms, to provide online payment tools, to provide commercial or advertising services, or SMS or email services.

In this type of transfer, Lydia ensures that the processing is carried out in accordance with this policy and that it complies with the European Commission standard contractual clauses which guarantee a sufficient level of protection of Clients’ personal privacy and basic rights.

**6.2 To supervisory authorities**

Lydia may disclose information about Clients, including their personal data, to the court, governmental or law enforcement authorities or to authorised third parties, if required or permitted by law, or if such disclosure is reasonably deemed necessary: ​​(i) to comply with its legal obligations, (ii) to comply with legal procedures, and to respond to claims against Lydia, (iii) to respond to verified claims during an alleged or suspected illegal investigation or illegal activity or any other activity that may expose Lydia or its users to legal liability, (iv) to perform or execute its [Terms of Service](https://lydia-app.com/en/about/terms-of-service.html) or (v) to protect the rights, property or personal safety or Lydia, its employees, users or the public.

If necessary, Lydia may inform its Client of these legal requests, except in the following cases: (i) when any notification is prohibited by the court proceedings, by order of the court or in accordance with existing laws, or (ii) if Lydia is of the opinion that informing the Client would be irrelevant, ineffective, could constitute a risk of injury or personal injury to an individual or a group or create or intensify a risk of fraud concerning our assets or those of its users.

#### 7\. COMMERCIAL INTERESTS

In accordance with the relevant laws and with Clients’ consent when required, Lydia may use Clients’ personal data for commercial interest (e.g. to send Clients newsletters, invitations to events or other communication that may be of interest to them, and to display targeted advertising on social media platforms or third-party sites).

The Client can always unsubscribe from Lydia’s email newsletter by setting his/her “Preferences” in the last tab of the Application, by clicking on the unsubscribe link provided in each of Lydia’s communications or by contacting Lydia’s support team by email at: support@lydia-app.com.
