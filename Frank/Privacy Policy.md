-----------------------------------------------------------------

We may collect your information through different means, which are explained below.

The Service requires a user account to work. When you register as a user of the Service, we may collect following information:

For the purpose of providing you the Service, we may collect your information from JOLLA and/or VIRTA and/or KOSKI  databases or Oma Opintopolku-service provided by Finnish National Agency of Education in order to verify your student status.
