Availability

**Service Criteria**

**Measurement and frequency of measurement**

**Service Criteria**

Availability

Availability = Uptime / (Total Time – Excused Downtime) x 100

\[As an example, the month of March with an excused downtime of 3 minutes and an uptime of 44,194 minutes would be calculated as follows:. 44,194 ÷ 44,637 (44,640 total number of up minutes in March minus excused downtime) = .99000 x 100 = 99%. \]

Where:  
  
**Uptime** means the time (measured in minutes) in any month during which the Hosting Platform is available for use by the Subscriber as intended **and responds to single document requests within 250 milliseconds at the 99th percentile for all requests at a request volume of 150 TPS or less. Response times will be measured as time to first byte (TTFB**).  
  
**Total Time** means the time (measured in minutes) in any month.  
  
**Excused Downtime** means the time (measured in minutes) in any month during which the Hosting Platform is not available due to any of the following:

1.  A Force Majeure Event
2.  Failure of the Subscriber's equipment
3.  Act or omission of the Subscriber
4.  Scheduled Maintenance as described below
5.  Region-wide failure at Amazon Web Services ("AWS") (using the AWS service dashboard as indicator)

Availability

  
**Scheduled Maintenance**

Cloudant will schedule maintenance to the Hosting Platform during non-peak usage hours. Any scheduled maintenance that may result in the Hosting Services being unavailable will be notified to Subscriber's technical contact no less than 1 business day before the commencement of the maintenance unless maintenance is being conducted due to an emergency.

**Emergency Maintenance**

Cloudant may temporarily limit or suspend the availability of all or part of the Hosting Platform if it is necessary for reasons of public safety, security, maintenance of the Hosting Services, interoperability of services, data protection, or to perform work that is necessary for operational or technical reasons. If emergency maintenance is required as defined in this Section then Cloudant will notify Subscriber's technical contact immediately upon commencement of the maintenance.

Availability Credits

1.  In order to be eligible to receive a credit, you must submit your claim for an Availability Credit no later than two (2) weeks after the end of the contracted month that is the subject of the claim. You must provide all necessary detailed information about the Event, including but not limited to detailed descriptions of all relevant Events and the Service Level claimed not to have been met. You must also reasonably assist Cloudant with the diagnosis and resolution of the Event to the extent required.
  
3.  Cloudant will then conduct an internal investigation within three (3) business days after receipt of such claim and will measure Availability. For each valid claim, Cloudant will apply the highest applicable Availability Credit based on the achieved Service Level during each contracted month, as shown on the table below. Cloudant will not be liable for multiple Availability Credits for the same Event(s) in the same contracted month.
  
5.  Cloudant will use its reasonable judgment to validate claims based on information available in Cloudant's records, which will prevail in the event of a conflict with data in your records.
  
7.  THE AVAILABILITY CREDITS PROVIDED TO YOU IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS SLA ARE YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM.

In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or that the Disclosing Party waives compliance with the provisions hereof, the Receiving Party shall furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which it is advised by counsel is legally required to be disclosed, and shall use its reasonable efforts to insure that confidential treatment shall be afforded such disclosed portion of the Confidential Information.
