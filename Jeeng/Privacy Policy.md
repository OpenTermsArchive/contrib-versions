We also protect the privacy of our website visitors, followers, vendors, service providers, partners and others who come in contact with Jeeng (these and any others with respect to whom we collect personal data, shall collectively be referred to as “Customers” or “you” or “Data Subjects”).

This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of Personal Data (i.e., any information which can be used to identify you), as well as other information we gather when you access any of our websites, including, but not limited to [www.powerinbox.com](http://www.powerinbox.com/), [www.rs-stripe.com](http://www.rs-stripe.com/), and [www.jeeng.com](https://www.jeeng.com/) (collectively, the “Site”) or interact with our services, including but not limited to AdServer for Email, RevenueStripe, email, web and push notifications and Advertiser Network (collectively, the Site and these services are the “Services”).

This policy provides information to our data subjects regarding the collection of personal data and the manner in which it is used. Please read the following carefully to understand our practices regarding your personal data and how we will process it.

For the purposes of EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and other applicable data protection law, (together, the “Data Protection Law”), Jeeng is the Controller of personal data of its employees, candidates and customers.

### 1\. WHICH INFORMATION WE COLLECT

There are several categories of information and data we collect from our Customers.

One type of Data is non-identifiable and anonymous information (“non-personal data”). We also collect several categories of personal data (“Personal Data”). This includes personally identifiable data provided consciously and voluntarily by you, or by an organization you represent or are associated with or through your use of the Services. This may include personal information, such as email and IP address, view, click and conversion history and other information you choose to provide to Jeeng.

Additionally, we may obtain location data related to the geographic location of your laptop, mobile device or other digital device on which the Services are used.

You do not have any legal obligation to provide any information to Jeeng, however, we require certain information in order to perform contracts or to provide the Services. If you choose not to provide us with certain information, we may not be able to provide you with some or all of the Services.

Jeeng also collects the email addresses of people who communicate with Jeeng via email or via messenger services or other social media platforms or create accounts and login credentials.

By registering for the Services, Jeeng will collect details, including also your name, your company name, your phone number and the personal or company email you provided, your address and other such information. Jeeng uses this information to offer the Services and support, and will share this data across Jeeng group companies and affiliates to optimize the Services.

Payments are collected mainly by our payment gateway service provider. During checkout, you will be asked to provide your payment method, your billing information and other contact information. The billing information (such as credit card details) you enter through our payment gateway service provider is not stored on our servers. Similarly, our vendors are paid through our payment facilitator platform, which collects the relevant billing and tax information required for proper payment and store it securely solely on its own servers.

When you use the Services, Jeeng may collect further information, such as session durations, page impressions, advertisements viewed or clicked on, Internet protocol (IP) addresses, the domain name that served you to access the Services, the geographic location of the computer system that you are using to log-in, and content types and origins. Jeeng may also track further information relating to you, when you activate and access the Services, such as the frequency and the extent of your use of the Services.

Jeeng may automatically collect information through the use of log files and other means. If you register with the Services, information gathered may then be personal data. If you are not a registered user, then we will not knowingly make use of any information, which personally identifies you, except as specifically indicated in this policy, or on the Website. Further information may be collected when we exchange communications with you, for example, when you submit an inquiry, or a request, or if our designated copyright agent contacts you.

Jeeng also collects data relating to employees. This is governed by a specific notice we have made available to our employees.

Jeeng also collects data relating to employment candidates. This includes CVs and the data contained therein, notes on meetings, standardized tests, reports, references, interviewer impressions and such industry standard data, as well as collecting data made publicly available or available to us on social networks. We collect such data based on the intention of the candidate to enter into an employment agreement with Jeeng.

### 9\. SECURITY AND STORAGE OF INFORMATION

We take great care in implementing, enforcing and maintaining the security of the personal data we process. Jeeng implements, enforces and maintains security measures, technologies and policies to prevent the unauthorized or accidental access to or destruction, loss, modification, use or disclosure of personal data. We likewise take steps to monitor compliance of such policies on an ongoing basis. Where we deem it necessary in light of the nature of the data in question and the risks to data subjects, we may encrypt data. Likewise, we take industry standard steps to ensure our websites are safe.

Note however, that no data security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, leaks, viruses and other data security breaches will never occur.

Within Jeeng, we endeavor to limit access to personal data to those of our personnel who: (i) require access in order for Jeeng to fulfil its obligations, including also under this Privacy Policy and its agreements, and (ii) have been appropriately and periodically trained on the requirements applicable to the processing, care and handling of the Personal Data, and (iii) are under confidentiality obligations as may be required under applicable law.

Jeeng shall act in accordance with its policies and with applicable law to promptly notify the relevant authorities and data subjects in the event that any personal data processed by Jeeng is lost, stolen, or where there has been any unauthorized access to it, all in accordance with applicable law and on the instructions of qualified authority. Jeeng shall promptly take reasonable remedial measures.

### 10\. DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS

Data subjects with respect to whose data GDPR applies, have rights under GDPR and local laws, including, in different circumstances, rights to: data portability, access data, rectify data, object to processing, and erase data. It is clarified for the removal of doubt, that where personal data is provided by a customer being the data subject’s employer, such data subject rights will have to be effected through that customer. In addition, data subject rights cannot be exercised in a manner inconsistent with the rights of Jeeng employees and staff, with Jeeng proprietary rights, and third-party rights. As such, job references, reviews, internal notes and assessments, documents and notes including proprietary information or forms of intellectual property, cannot be accessed or erased or rectified. In addition, these rights may not be exercisable where they relate to data that is not in a structured form, for example emails, or where other exemptions apply. If processing occurs based on consent, data subjects have a right to withdraw their consent. In any case, Jeeng will not share your personal identifiable details with any advertisers without your consent.

If, for any reason, a data subject wishes to exercise these rights and modify, delete or retrieve their Personal Data, they may be able to do so by contacting Jeeng (dpo@powerinbox.com). Note that Jeeng has to undertake a process to identify a data subject exercising their rights. Jeeng may keep details of such rights exercised for its own compliance and audit requirements. Please note that Personal Data may be either deleted or retained in an aggregated manner without being linked to any identifiers or Personal Data, depending on technical commercial capability. Such information may continue to be used by Jeeng.

Data subjects in the EU have the right to lodge a complaint, with a data protection supervisory authority in the place of their habitual residence. A list of Supervisory Authorities is available here:  [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members\_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en)
