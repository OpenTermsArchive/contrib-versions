Privacy Notice
--------------

Last modified September 3, 2025

*   General
*   "Personal Information" means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household, such as your name, mailing and email addresses, phone number, and other information that permits us to contact you at a physical location, online, or by electronic communication, including telephone or email.
*   Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meaning given to them in SaaS Agreement and Terms of Service. The SaaS Agreement and the Terms of Service fully detail both Proctorio's and the Institution's obligations in relation to the confidentiality of data.
*   Proctorio limits the Personal Information collected from end-users through their use of Proctorio's Services.
*   Proctorio only collects Personal Information as instructed by your Institution. This is dependent on the Services and settings selected by the relevant Institution-approved representatives.
*   Proctorio pseudoanonymizes specific test-taker Personal Information.
*   Audio, video, and screen recordings and images collected and stored by Proctorio are encrypted and can only be decrypted by Institution-approved representatives. For the avoidance of doubt, Proctorio cannot decrypt the audio, video, screen recordings and images collected and stored by Proctorio.
*   If you voluntarily provide Personal Information through Proctorio's Sites or Services, Proctorio may retain this Information.
*   If you voluntarily provide Personal Information through Proctorio's Sites or Services, Proctorio may retain this Information.

**Proctorio's Institution Services** When an Institution purchases Proctorio's Services, the type of Service and settings selected by the Institution determine what Personal Information an Institution may provide to Proctorio or what Proctorio can collect from the test taker. This is described in more detail below.

**Test-taker audio, video, and screen recordings and images received from Institutions and processed by Proctorio are end-to-end encrypted and can only be decrypted by Institution-approved representatives.**

Proctoring
----------

Only an Institution may request Proctorio to use Automated or Live Proctoring during the administration of an exam.

With either Automated or Live Proctoring, an exam administrator may instruct Proctorio to monitor test takers via a webcam, microphone, browser, and/or desktop in an effort to uphold the integrity of the assessment. This may include a scan of the test taker's surroundings, screen, and computer display. This monitoring will either be automated and/or conducted by a live proctor. The test taker will be notified, before the beginning of an exam, whether Automated or Live Proctoring is being used.

### Video and audio recording

**Only your Institution maintains and controls the decryption keys necessary to decrypt test-taker audio and video recordings and images. As previously stated, Proctorio cannot decrypt the audio, video, and screen recordings and images collected and stored by Proctorio.**

The Institution determines whether audio and/or video is used to monitor and/or record exam sessions and only the exam administrators have access to these audio and/or video recordings. If selected, the entire exam session may be recorded.

The Institution also decides whether to record the test taker's audio during the exam attempt. If selected, the test taker's microphone may be turned on during the session.

Audio, video, and image files are encrypted prior to being transferred to Proctorio's cloud service provider in the location specified by the Institution. The Institution maintains and controls decryption keys, and only the Institution may assign these keys to individuals who the Institution designates as appropriate.

Depending on the Institution's location, these audio and video files are stored on Proctorio's cloud service provider's servers in the US, Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia, South Africa, Singapore, or Abu Dhabi. These files never leave the controlling location of the Institution.

**Record Screen, Record Web Traffic, and Record Room/ Periodic Desk Scan** are additional options that an exam administrator can select for an exam.

**Verify Audio, Video, Desktop and Signature** may also be selected by the exam administrator and the test taker is required to take those actions prior to the start of the exam.

As a result of these Institution-selected monitoring or verification options, Proctorio may collect Personal Information such as a test taker's image and Personal Information that may be shared through the screen, desktop, webcam, web traffic or microphone of the test taker's device.

### Facial and gaze detection

If your Institution elects to use Proctorio's proctoring Services that enable video recording, Proctorio uses facial detection or gaze detection to flag potentially suspicious test activity to help Institution-approved representatives maintain assessment integrity. The Institution may choose to disable facial detection and gaze detection as a secondary setting of the video recording feature if it wishes to opt out of facial detection and gaze detection, but still record the exam session.

**Proctorio does not use what is conventionally known as "biometrics" or "facial recognition" technology.** Facial recognition uniquely identifies specific people by assessing whether the face in one image matches the face in another image. It requires a database of either images of people's faces, or biometric representations of them, and technology that compares new images or biometric representations with entries in that database.

**Instead, Proctorio uses "facial detection" or "gaze detection" technology.** A fundamental difference between these technologies and biometrics or facial recognition technology is that facial or gaze detection technologies do not use geometry or landmarks as identifiers. Additionally, this difference can be illustrated by the questions they answer:

**Facial Recognition:** "Does the face in this picture match the face in this other picture?"

**Facial Detection:** "Is there a face in this picture?"

**Gaze Detection:** "Is the person looking away from the camera or the exam screen?"

**Facial detection can identify that there is a human face present in an image or video recording, but it cannot identify that person - only that there is, indeed, a person in the image or recording.**

**Gaze detection can determine the direction that the individual is looking, but cannot identify who they are or what they are looking at.**

If the exam administrator enables the use of video recording, Proctorio uses facial detection to flag video evidence that may indicate the number of individuals present within the immediate vicinity of the test taker, but Proctorio does not attempt to determine who those individuals are.

If a test taker is not able to pass the face detection process and enter an exam within three attempts, a Proctorio Support Agent initiates a live chat to troubleshoot the issue. The Support Agent can request access to webcam images from the system, provide instructions that ensure clearly-captured images, and override the system if needed to expedite exam entry.

If the exam administrator enables the use of video recording, Proctorio can use gaze detection to flag video evidence that the individual was looking at something other than the device they were using to take the exam. This helps Institution-approved representatives prioritize where to review exam video recordings to determine if the test taker was consulting unauthorized materials or was receiving outside assistance during the exam attempt. However, the Institution may choose to disable facial detection and gaze detection as a secondary setting of the video recording feature if it wishes to opt out of facial detection and gaze detection, but still record the exam session.

### Monitoring during an exam

When exam administrators select Automated or Live Proctoring Services, Proctorio uses technology to automatically collect certain information about a test taker's activities during the exam session for purposes of protecting exam integrity. The flagged behaviors may include facial and gaze detection (described above) to monitor if the test taker leaves the session, tracked head movement to monitor how frequently the test taker looks away, sound detection to monitor if other voices are in the room, question response time, dropped internet connections, and other activities that may indicate irregular testing activities. When using these services, Proctorio's automated technology continually monitors the applications and processes that are running on the device during an exam session and during exam review.

If an Institution has requested reporting, test-taker data may be aggregated, and then individual test-taker data may be compared to the aggregated data to look for patterns or anomalies, such as whether a test taker spent an unusually long time answering a question relative to other users.

Proctorio does not and has not established "normal" profiles or compare test takers against any preserved or aggregated normal.

At the end of an exam session, the Institution-approved representative will have access to a summary report of these flagged activities, as well as the raw data the Service collects from each test-taker's session. The Institution-approved representative then determines if any further action is warranted. Aggregated data is also provided to the Institution-approved representative (e.g. the average length of time users spent on an exam question, the average time spent on the entire assessment and the average date/time that users started the exam session).

Only an Institution determines whether to enable settings, which settings are enabled for flagging of irregular testing behaviors, and the indication levels (green, yellow, red) assigned to certain activities of the test taker during an exam. Following the Institution-approved representative's review, only they can determine what, if any, action to take related to a test taker.

**Proctorio does not make any decisions related to the test taker from flagged activity.**

ID Verification
---------------

Additionally, an Institution may select an option to verify the test taker's identity before they start their exam. The Institution can choose the Live ID Verification or the Automated ID Verification option. In both options, the Personal Information that is collected may include name, government ID number, and date of birth if the test taker chooses to utilize their government-issued ID or the Institution requires the test taker to use the government-issued ID to validate their identity.

This ID image along with other test-taker audio, video, and screen recordings and images are stored with Zero-Knowledge Encryption by Proctorio as described below.

Proctorio uses a third-party sub-processor to conduct identity verification of test takers. When conducting identity verification, and with test takers’ explicit consent, Proctorio provides the sub-processor with test takers’ credit cards, identity documents, and/or biometric data ("Underlying Data") solely to verify identity of test takers. As soon as the subprocessor verifies identity, Proctorio initiates a redaction sequence from the sub-processor who then immediately redacts all Underlying Data. At no time does Proctorio retain or store any Underlying Data.

### Live ID

If this option is selected by the Institution, a photo of the Institution-accepted form of ID will be collected with the webcam and encrypted on Proctorio's servers. The image will be accessible by an Institution-approved representative along with the exam results within the Institution's assessment platform. Additionally, during the pre-checks a Proctorio proctor will request to see the Institution-accepted form of ID and will record this information. A proctor cannot personally store or use this information other than to verify the test taker's identity.

The file is transmitted directly from the test taker to the proctor. After the transmission and the identity is verified, the file is immediately deleted.

### Automated ID

If this option is selected by the Institution, a photo of the Institution-accepted form of ID will be collected with the webcam and encrypted on Proctorio's servers. The image will only be accessible by an Institution-approved representative along with the exam results within the Institution's assessment platform.

### Originality Verification

If an Institution selects Proctorio's Originality Verification tool, the End User may voluntarily submit an assignment that has content or data with Personal Information included.

Lock Down Settings
------------------

If these settings are selected by an Institution and enabled on an assessment that uses Proctorio's Services, these features can be used instead of or alongside the monitoring features described above.

Depending on which features are selected by an Institution, the test taker's device will be locked down so that they cannot access websites, files, or other online or device resources. The test takers will be prevented from downloading materials or entering information that doesn't relate to the exam only during the exam session. This is done to help ensure test integrity.

When operating as a browser extension, Proctorio only has restricted access to a test taker's computer system. This includes no access to any personal documents or files stored on the machine.

**Users have the ability to disable the Proctorio extension immediately after an exam is submitted.**

Although it is not necessary to do so, test takers can uninstall or disable Proctorio immediately after taking an exam, and re-install or enable it only when taking future Proctorio-proctored exams.

Test takers are alerted when Proctorio is recording, through the exam process, by the Proctorio shield icon in the upper-right-hand corner of the browser turns green, and during exam review.

This green icon indicates that the extension is running during the exam.

Lock Down settings include the following, and exam administrators can choose to implement some, all, or none of these during the exam:

#### Read and change data on the websites you visit

This allows Proctorio to run on each and every website required by your exam administrator or Institution without requiring additional permissions.

#### Display notifications

Proctorio may display a pop-up notification while you are in the exam if you navigate away from the exam. This notification states that you are required to return to the exam window.

#### Modify your copy and paste functionality

The Proctorio platform's functionality does not include the ability to read or collect the contents in the test taker's clipboard. Instead, during the exam, Proctorio replaces the clipboard text with Proctorio's own content to prevent exam content distribution.

#### Capture content from your screen

This recording setting only runs during the exam and exam review. This ensures that test takers are remaining within the exam and showing their work with authorized tools and resources.

#### Manage your downloads

Downloads by a test taker will be prevented only during the course of the exam. This ensures that exam content is not shared externally.

#### Identify storage devices

Test-taker storage devices are detected and identified during the exam. **Proctorio does not eject storage devices.**

#### Manage your apps, extensions, and themes

Proctorio does not manage the themes of a test taker's device. But Proctorio does manage extensions and applications that may hinder Proctorio from operating properly.

#### Change your privacy-related settings

Proctorio uses this to temporarily block the test taker's browser "password" fill option during the course of the exam.

Zero-Knowledge Encryption
-------------------------

When processing and securing test-taker Information from an Institution, Proctorio does not mess around. That's why Proctorio utilizes an end to end encryption method called **"Zero-KnowledgeEncryption."**

**"Zero-Knowledge Encryption" means that only Institution-approved representatives at Institutions can decrypt and review the encrypted exam recordings on Proctorio's servers.**

Only the Institution has the "key" that is needed to access Personal Information that they've provided to their test takers or test-taker Personal Information that has been provided to Proctorio. Proctorio utilizes PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 to generate the keys. Then AES-256 GCM encryption is used to encrypt the files and finally Proctorio uses TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 with perfect forward secrecy to transfer any and all data.

Proctorio uses Zero-Knowledge Encryption for any audio, video, and screen recordings and images sent by a test taker. This means only Institution-approved representatives can decrypt, watch, and review the encrypted Information.

Test-taker records
------------------

All test-taker records that are "student" or "educational records" obtained by Proctorio from an Institution are the property of the Institution and are under the control of that Institution. Institutions or the respective test taker owns the data.

Proctorio will follow the instructions provided by the Institution and make every effort to comply with applicable law. In these instances, Proctorio is a processor for the Institution and the Institution is the controller. The Institution's Privacy Notice controls the use of test-taker Information.

**If you are looking for information regarding your test-taker records please reach out to your Institution.**

*   Proctorio doesn't share test-taker data with third parties for any marketing purposes.

As a data processor:
--------------------

Data that enters Proctorio's system has been encrypted using an unshared key stored in an Institution's assessment platform and can only be unlocked by the Institution-approved representative within the assessment platform. Proctorio utilizes the assessment platform to gain information about the user's role. This restricts information from being shared with users who are not labeled as an Institution-approved representative. The entire process is transparent to the end user.

To the extent such functionality is made available in the Services, it is provided by an unaffiliated third party, and like any other third-party service, is subject to their terms of use.

### Third-party service providers

Proctorio uses third-party service providers to help provide Proctorio's Services, such as hosting Proctorio's various blogs, Help Center, and knowledge bases, and to help Institutions understand the use of Proctorio's Services. Since Proctorio uses Zero-Knowledge Encryption for audio, video, screen recordings and images, it is encrypted and not accessible by the third-party service provider.

What about student education records and FERPA?
-----------------------------------------------

Proctorio adheres to the [Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html), as applicable, when it is providing Services to educational Institutions in the United States that are subject to FERPA.

Proctorio works with Institutions to ensure compliance with FERPA and applicable privacy laws. One of the most important ways in which we strive to adhere to FERPA and restrict disclosure is to encrypt test-taker audio, video, and screen recordings and images. As described in this Privacy Notice, [Proctorio uses Zero-Knowledge Encryption](#section-zeroknowledgeencryption) to do this when an Institution has an agreement to utilize Proctorio's Services.

#### What is FERPA?

FERPA is a federal law that affords students (or parents/guardians for students under 18 or not enrolled in a post-secondary Institution) certain rights with respect to their education records.

In the United States, Proctorio has agreements with educational Institutions that are subject to FERPA and Proctorio acts as a third-party service provider of such educational Institutions and must make every effort to comply with FERPA generally as a "School Official." This means Proctorio is providing Proctorio's Services on behalf of the educational Institution and only as authorized by them for legitimate educational purposes.

#### Why is FERPA important?

FERPA protects students from having their information disclosed to third parties without the eligible student (18+) or parent's/guardian's consent, unless there is an applicable exception under FERPA, such as when a third-party service provider is authorized by an educational Institution by a written agreement to provide services as a "School Official."

Proctorio complies with FERPA by only using student Personal Information as a School Official as authorized by an educational Institution in Proctorio's written agreements.

Audio, video, and screen recordings and images collected during the exam attempt, stored by Proctorio, and received from an Institution are encrypted using Zero-Knowledge Encryption. These recordings and images can only be decrypted and reviewed by Institution-approved representatives within the Institution's assessment platform. Proctorio dictates who these authorized users are by utilizing the educational Institution's assessment platform to gain information about the user's role. This restricts information from being shared with users who do not fall under the "School Official" role. The entire process is transparent to the end user. Proctorio securely delivers all content for the Services encrypted and Proctorio's servers make every effort to comply with industry security standards, including SOC 2, ISO 27001, ISO 27018 and PCI-DSS.

For Proctorio's technical support channels, Proctorio's Support Representatives are trained on privacy and security and are instructed not to ask for information beyond what FERPA defines as "Directory Information". This information may include:

*   Student full name
*   Campus email address
*   Institution name

To better ensure FERPA and privacy and security compliance, Proctorio's employees receive periodic privacy and security training. Proctorio has been SOC 2, ISO 27001 and ISO 27018 certified.

#### Canadian User Rights - FIPPA and PIPEDA

Proctorio makes every effort to cooperate with Institutions in compliance with the Canadian Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act ("FIPPA"), Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act ("PIPEDA"), and all federal and provincial laws and regulations, including those related to privacy and anti-spam legislation.

FIPPA provides Canadian citizens with the right to access information under the control of Institutions, while PIPEDA aims to protect the privacy rights of individuals by regulating how organizations handle their personal information and fostering transparency, accountability, and consent in the collection and use of personal data.

This document, the SaaS Agreement, and the Terms of Service all detail Proctorio's and the Institution's obligations in regard to confidentiality, transparency, accountability, and consent in the collection and use of data. FIPPA and PIPEDA compliance are predicated on all Parties' compliance with these provisions.

Further, with regard to PIPEDA's ten "Fair Information Principles" forming the framework for how Personal Information should be collected and disclosed, the Privacy Notice complies with that as well. The goal of the Fair Information Principles is to examine any collection and use of Personal Information, and ensure that it only be used in such a way that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances. Proctorio, throughout this document, complies with that ask by being fully transparent and open with regard to all of its policies, and approaching them in not only a fully reasonable manner, but also in a cautious manner looking toward protecting all Personal Information.

European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland User Rights
-------------------------------------------------------

Legal basis for processing your Information: If you are a Proctorio user or are visiting Proctorio's Site(s) and are located in the European Economic Area ("EEA"), Proctorio's legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Information described above will depend on the Personal Information concerned and the specific context in which Proctorio collects it. When Proctorio is a processor for an Institution, their Privacy Notice controls the processing of your Personal Information. Proctorio encourages you to read your Institution's Privacy Notice for a legal understanding of how, when, and why your Personal Information may be collected and how it is used.

When Proctorio is a data controller: If you are based in the EEA or Switzerland, you acknowledge that Proctorio may transfer your Information (including Personal Information) to Proctorio and Proctorio's facilities in the United States or elsewhere, including those of third parties as described in the "Business transfers" and "Third-party service providers" sections of this Privacy Notice.

Data portability refers to the ability of individuals to easily and securely transfer their data from one organization or platform to another. The purpose of data portability is to empower individuals with greater control and flexibility regarding their Personal Information.

Institutions have the ability to export data stored by Proctorio. Test-takers must contact their Institution and since test-taker records are under the control of that Institution.

**Marketing**: For Institution-approved representatives, you have the right to opt-out of marketing communications Proctorio sends you at any time. You can do this by clicking the "unsubscribe" link in the marketing email Proctorio sent you or by contacting Proctorio using one of [the contact channels provided](#contact-information).

If using the contact details please provide your:

Please note that such marketing opt-out does not impact any transaction or operation notices that Proctorio may need to send you. Note that Proctorio does not market to test takers.

Protecting your Information
---------------------------

*   For test-taker Information that Proctorio processes for an Institution, Proctorio implements Zero-Knowledge Encryption, which means only Institution-approved representatives can decrypt and review encrypted exam recordings.

Security
--------

Proctorio employs procedural and technical security measures that are reasonably designed to help protect Proctorio's test takers' Personal Information from loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction, which includes encryption and other security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to a test taker's Personal Information. The data a test taker transmits as part of their use of the Institution Services ("Storage Data") is encrypted and Proctorio does not have the decryption keys to decrypt or review test-taker Storage Data in its unencrypted form.

Proctorio is committed to maintaining the security and confidentiality of test-taker Information.

Towards this end, Proctorio takes the following actions:

(a) Proctorio limits employee access to test-taker information to only those employees and contractors who need the information to fulfill their job responsibilities;

(b) Proctorio conducts regular employee privacy and data security training and education; and

(c) Proctorio protects your Information with technical, contractual, administrative, and physical security safeguards in order to protect against unauthorized access, release, or use.

Proctorio is SOC 2, ISO 27001, and ISO 27018 certified and conducts regular security audits including penetration testing and vulnerability assessments. Institutions or their designated representatives may review security testing results, subject to confidentiality requirements, or conduct their own security audit of Proctorio's data security and storage practices, subject to mutual agreement. Written requests for inspection and testing can be made to [\[email protected\]](https://proctorio.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

Test-taker audio, video, and screen recordings and images are secured and processed through three layers of encryption:

1.  The Zero-Knowledge Encryption layer is used when information is stored and is secured using AES-GCM.
2.  Transmission into the datacenter is over TLSv1.2 / TLSv1.3 and, if the client supports it, Proctorio uses Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).
3.  Proctorio is SOC 2, ISO 27001, and ISO 27018 certified.

Security systems breach notification

Proctorio investigates and provides notification of data breaches in accordance with our internal Security Incident Policy ­and applicable law.

#### As a data processor

**Proctorio will notify the Institution. The Institution is responsible for notifying its test takers.**

#### As a data controller

If Proctorio learns of a security systems breach, Proctorio may attempt to notify you electronically. Proctorio may post a notice on Proctorio's Sites and/or Services if a security breach occurs. Proctorio may also send an email at the email address provided. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.

Live proctors
-------------

Live proctors are used for Live Proctoring and Live ID Verification Services only when selected by an Institution.

All Proctorio proctors sign a confidentiality agreement restricting them from using and disclosing any of the test taker's Personal Information for any purpose other than providing the testing services.

All Proctorio proctors are full-time Proctorio employees and are required to go through an extensive background check and fingerprinting process. All Proctorio proctors can view, note, and record exam attempts. Proctorio proctors go through a five-week training process with Proctorio's Proctorio Training Specialists and must complete Privacy & Security Training. The proctors are the only employees who have access to the tools required for Live Proctoring and only company-owned and controlled devices can access this information. This is further restricted using IP address restrictions to ensure these devices are being accessed in appropriate locations. Proctorio proctors are then uniquely identified at sign-on by using two-factor authentication and the device is restricted based on the user's group, department, and access level. Device compliance testing is run regularly and devices out of compliance are blocked from accessing any restricted resources until compliance is restored.

Data storage
------------

*   Proctorio stores test-taker Personal Information, including all audio, video, and screen recordings and images, which Proctorio collects during the exam for the minimum amount of time required by the Institution or by applicable law.
*   The length and location of how and where data for operations is stored varies and is dependent on applicable law and the information itself.
*   Whether Proctorio is acting as the data controller or the data processor all Personal Information is encrypted in transmission and at rest.

As a data processor
-------------------

Proctorio retains data as directed by an Institution related to the Services that Proctorio provides to them.

Proctorio retains test-taker De-Identified Data to track usage, allow Proctorio to process billing for Institutions that are Proctorio's customers, and track global usage of Proctorio's Services. "De-Identified Data" (or pseudonymized) includes:

*   A pseudonymous hash of the User ID
*   A pseudonymous hash of the Exam ID
*   A pseudonymous hash of the Course ID (when applicable)
*   Approximate location where the exam was taken
*   Exam attempt number
*   Length of exam
*   Date of exam
*   Anonymous telemetry events

As a data controller 
---------------------

In situations when Proctorio acts as a data controller, the Personal Information provided by an individual is dependent on the Services, Site(s), or third-party applications accessed by the individual.

Retention, location, data deletion, and destruction
---------------------------------------------------

**When Proctorio is the data processor,** Proctorio uses a third-party cloud provider for the storage of encrypted, collected data. Data is stored in data centers requested or chosen by the partnered Institution. Institutions can choose to store the data in a data center that is geographically relevant to their location or in another, potentially further away data center.

Proctorio retains data only as directed by an Institution related to the Services that Proctorio provides to them. Proctorio will store and maintain Institutional data for up to 30 days after the termination of an applicable agreement, unless otherwise specified by the Institution or as required by applicable law.

\*\*Proctorio cannot and does not retain exam attempt recordings or chat transcripts for longer than required by the Institution or applicable law.  
  
When Proctorio is a processor for an Institution, Proctorio will direct the test taker to contact their respective Institution with any requests related to their Personal Information.

**When Proctorio is a data controller,** this data is stored in locations and for time frames dependent on the Services used or Site(s) and/or third-party application(s) accessed by the individual.

Proctorio retains the previously described Information only for as long as needed for Proctorio's legitimate business purposes and as required by applicable laws, investigations, or other security matters.
