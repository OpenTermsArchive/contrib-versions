The Content You submit, post, or display may be viewed by Your Institution’s authorized representatives. You should only provide Content that You are comfortable sharing with others under these Terms.

You may use the Services only if You or Your Institution can form a binding contract with Proctorio and are not barred from receiving services under the laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. If You accept these Terms and use the Services on behalf of an Institution, You represent and warrant that You are authorized to do so. You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations.

The Services that Proctorio provides evolve, and the form and nature of the Services may change without prior notice to You. In addition, Proctorio may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing Services (or any features within the Services) to You and/or may create limits on use at our sole discretion without providing prior notice, unless otherwise agreed.

Access to certain areas of Proctorio’s website is restricted. Proctorio reserves the right to restrict access to areas of its website, or its entire website, at our discretion.

If Proctorio provides You with a username and password, API key and secret, or consumer key and secret to grant You access to restricted areas of its website, Content, or Services, You must ensure that these credentials are kept confidential. Proctorio is not liable for any loss or damage arising from Your failure to comply with the above requirements.

Proctorio may disable Your username and password, API key and secret, or consumer key and secret in Proctorio’s sole discretion without notice or explanation.

### 11\. Ending these Terms.

The Terms will continue to apply until terminated by either You or Proctorio, pursuant to the following provisions, unless You are otherwise subject to certain termination provisions arising from a SaaS Agreement with Proctorio.

You may terminate Your agreement with Proctorio at any time for any reason, without notifying us, by discontinuing Your use of the Services, unless otherwise provided in a SaaS Agreement. If You stop using the Services Your accounts may be deactivated due to prolonged inactivity under Proctorio’s sole discretion.

We may suspend or terminate Your account or cease providing You or Your authorized user with all or part of the Services at any time for any reason, including, but not limited to, if we reasonably believe: (i) You have violated these Terms; (ii) You create risk or possible legal exposure for us; or (iii) it is no longer commercially viable to provide Services to You. We will make reasonable efforts to notify You by the email address associated with Your account or the next time You attempt to access Your account.

In all such cases, the Terms shall terminate, including, without limitation, Your license to use the Services, except that the following sections shall continue to apply: 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 14.

Nothing in this section shall affect Proctorio’s rights to change, limit or stop the provision of the Services without prior notice, as provided above in Section 1.

### 12\. Indemnification.

If You entered into a SaaS Agreement with Proctorio, Proctorio agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold You harmless from and against any and all losses, liabilities, costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) or damages resulting from any third party claim that the Application Service and/or the Application Documentation infringes such third party’s U.S. patents issued as of the Effective Date or infringes or misappropriates, as applicable, such third party’s copyrights or trade secret rights under applicable laws of any jurisdiction, provided You promptly notify Proctorio in writing of the claim, cooperate with Proctorio, and allow Proctorio sole authority to control the defense and settlement of such claim. You agree to permit Proctorio, at Proctorio’s sole discretion, to enable You to continue to use the Application Service or the Application Documentation, or to modify or replace any such infringing material to make it non-infringing. If none of these alternatives is available, You shall, upon Proctorio’s written request, cease use of, and, if applicable, return, materials subject to the infringement claim. This provision shall not apply if the alleged infringement arises from any: (i) modification of the Application IP; (ii) combination, operation, or use of the Application IP with other non-Proctorio provided software, hardware or technology; (iii) use of a superseded or altered release of any of the Application IP, if You failed to use a then-current release of the Application IP we provided to you; (iv) Customer Content; or (v) Third Party Products (any of the foregoing circumstances under clauses (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) a "**Customer Indemnity Responsibility**"). THIS IS PROCTORIO’S ENTIRE OBLIGATION AND LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION CLAIMS, AND PROCTORIO’S LIABILITY UNDER THIS SECTION SHALL NOT EXCEED PROCTORIO’S LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY.

To the extent allowable by law You agree to hold harmless, indemnify, and, at Proctorio’s option, defend Proctorio from and against any losses, liabilities, costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) or damages resulting from: (i) Your or any Authorized End User’s negligence or willful misconduct; (ii) Your or any Authorized End User’s unauthorized use of the Application IP; or (iii) a Customer Indemnity Responsibility, provided that You will not settle any third-party claim against Proctorio without Proctorio’s consent.

### 13\. K-12 Institutions.

We recognize that certain privacy protections apply specifically to minors, and accordingly have implemented additional privacy and security protections in place for minor users. If you are accessing and using the Services as a representative of a K-12 Institution, as a parent of a child attending a K-12 Institution (collectively, "Minor Representative"), or as the minor child who has been given parental permission by a parent, the following terms will also apply to you.

A. Student Users. Minor students agree that they have obtained consent from a parent/legal guardian for their use of the Site and Services in connection with educational uses. By using the Site and Services, if you are a minor, you represent that you have obtained consent from your parent/legal guardian who has read and agrees to this Agreement on your behalf. If you do not obtain such consent, then you are not authorized to use the Site or the Services.

C. Collection of Student Information. We collect only the personal information from students that is needed for the operation and management of the Services, and only where the educational institution has contracted with Proctorio to do so. We first require that the educational institution obtain the consent of parents/legal guardians prior to collecting such information. If you are a minor student, do not send any personal information about yourself other than what is requested upon signing up for the Services. Further information concerning how student information is handled can be found in our [Privacy Policy](https://proctorio.com/privacy).

Each of the subsections below only applies up to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties or the limitation of liability in contracts, and as a result the contents of this section may not apply to You. Nothing in this section is intended to limit any rights You may have which may not be lawfully limited.

#### E. Proctorio Testing Center Membership.

If You entered into a SaaS Agreement with Proctorio, You agree to participate in any testing center program that Proctorio may require. Our current testing center program allows any educational institution’s Authorized End User to travel to any other Proctorio-participating institution and utilize that location’s testing center space (the "**Proctorio Testing Center Program**"). As a result, You must provide Your testing center facilities to an Authorized End User who received access to Proctorio’s services from another educational institution, without charge.

For recurring subscriptions, you will promptly update your account information with any changes (for example, a change in your billing address or credit card expiration date) that may occur.

#### G. Force Majeure.

Except for Payment, if You are prevented or delayed in performing Your obligations by circumstances beyond Your reasonable control, including, war, riot, fires, floods, epidemics, or failure of public utilities or public transportation systems, the failure or delay is not a material breach of the applicable SaaS Agreement, but the obligation will remain in full force and effect, and will be performed as soon as reasonably practicable after the termination of the relevant circumstances causing such delay, but if You are prevented from performing for more than ninety (90) days, the other Party may terminate the SaaS Agreement upon thirty (30) days’ written notice.

You and Proctorio will, at all times, act as independent contractors, and nothing contained in these Terms, or any other agreement, will be construed or implied to create an agency, partnership, or employer and employee relationship.

#### J. Waiver and Severability.

The failure of Proctorio to enforce any right or provision of these Terms, or any other applicable agreement, will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms, or any other applicable agreement, is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.

#### K. Controlling Law and Jurisdiction.

These Terms, any action related thereto, and all other agreements between You and Proctorio, unless otherwise stated, will be governed by Delaware State Law without regard to or application of its conflict of law provisions or Your state or country of residence. All claims, legal proceedings, or litigation arising in connection with the Services will be brought solely in the federal or state courts located in Maricopa County, Arizona, United States, and You consent to the jurisdiction of and venue in such courts and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum.

If You are a federal, state, or local government entity in the United States using the Services in your official capacity and legally unable to accept the controlling law, jurisdiction or venue clauses, then those clauses do not apply to You. For such U.S. federal government entities, these Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the United States of America (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the State of Delaware (excluding choice of law).

#### L. Entire Agreement.

These Terms and our [Privacy Policy](https://proctorio.com/privacy) are the entire and exclusive agreement between Proctorio and You regarding the Services (excluding any services for which You have an additional agreement with Proctorio), and these Terms supersede and replace any prior agreements between Proctorio and You regarding the Services. Other than members of the group of companies of which Proctorio is the parent, no other person or company will be third party beneficiaries to the Terms.

We may revise these Terms from time to time, the most current version will always be at proctorio.com/terms.
