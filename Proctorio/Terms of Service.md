9. Restrictions on Use of Services.


---------------------------------------

Proctorio has the right, but not the obligation, at all times to remove or refuse to distribute any Content on the Services, to suspend or terminate users without liability to You if we reasonably determine that the Content or users materially violated these Terms. Subject to applicable laws and the terms of Proctorio's [Privacy Policy](https://proctorio.com/privacy), we also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe necessary to: (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; (ii) enforce the Terms, including investigation of potential violations hereof; (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues; (iv) respond to user support requests; or (v) protect the rights, property, or safety of Proctorio, its users, its clients, and the public.

While accessing or using the Services You shall not: (i) access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the Services, Proctorio's computer systems, or the technical delivery systems of Proctorio's providers; (ii) probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or network or breach or circumvent any security or authentication measures; (iii) access or search or attempt to access or search the Services by any means (automated or otherwise) other than through Proctorio's currently available published interfaces (and only pursuant to those terms and conditions), unless You have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with Proctorio; (iv) forge any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any written communication, or in any way use the Services to send altered, deceptive, or false source-identifying information; or (v) interfere with, or disrupt (or attempt to do so), the access of any user, host, or network, including, without limitation, sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, mail-bombing the Services, or by scripting the creation of Content in such a manner as to interfere with or create an undue burden on the Services.

Proctorio’s Services are not considered an Automated Decision Tool (“ADT”).

We reserve the right to remove Content alleged to be infringing without prior notice, at Proctorio's sole discretion, and without liability to You. Proctorio will also terminate an Authorized User's account if the user is determined to be a repeat infringer.

**If you suspect Content to infringe upon the proprietary rights of others, please contact Proctorio's designated copyright agent found on dmca.copyright.gov/osp.**

11. Ending these Terms.


---------------------------

The Terms will continue to apply until terminated by either You or Proctorio, pursuant to the following provisions, unless You are otherwise subject to certain termination provisions arising from a SaaS Agreement with Proctorio.

An Authorized User may terminate Authorized User's agreement with Proctorio at any time for any reason, without notifying us, by discontinuing Authorized User's use of the Services, unless otherwise provided in a SaaS Agreement. If Authorized User stops using the Services, Authorized User's accounts may be deactivated due to prolonged inactivity and in Proctorio's sole discretion.

We may suspend or terminate Authorized User's account or cease providing Authorized User with all or part of the Services at any time for any reason, including, but not limited to, if we reasonably believe: (i) Authorized User has violated these Terms; (ii) Authorized User creates risk or possible legal exposure for Proctorio; or (iii) it is no longer commercially viable to provide Services to Authorized User. We will make reasonable efforts to notify Authorized User by the email address associated with Authorized User's account or the next time Authorized User attempts to access Authorized User's account.

In all such cases, the Terms shall terminate, including, without limitation, Authorized User license to use the Services, except that the following sections of these Terms of Service shall continue to apply: Sections 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 14.

Nothing in this section shall affect Proctorio's rights to change, limit or stop the provision of the Services without prior notice, as provided above in Section 1.

12. Indemnification.


------------------------

If You entered into a SaaS Agreement with Proctorio, Proctorio agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold You harmless from and against any and all losses, liabilities, costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees) or damages resulting from (a) any third party claim that the Application Service and/or the Application Documentation infringes such third party's U.S. patents issued as of the Effective Date or infringes or misappropriates, as applicable, such third party's copyrights or trade secret rights under applicable laws of any jurisdiction, provided You promptly notify Proctorio in writing of the claim, cooperate with Proctorio, and allow Proctorio sole authority to control the defense and settlement of such claim; provided however Proctorio shall not admit fault or liability on Your part without Your prior written consent; (b) any claim that Proctorio failed to comply with applicable law, or violated confidentiality obligations in a SaaS Agreement; (c) Proctorio's gross negligence or willful misconduct. In the event of a claim under (a), in addition to Proctorio's indemnification obligations, You agree to permit Proctorio, at Proctorio's sole discretion, to enable You to continue to use the Application Service or the Application Documentation, or to modify or replace any such infringing material to make it non-infringing. If none of these alternatives is available, You shall, upon Proctorio's written request, cease use of, and, if applicable, return, materials subject to the infringement claim. This provision shall not apply if the alleged infringement arises from any: (i) modification of the Application IP; (ii) combination, operation, or use of the Application IP with other non-Proctorio provided software, hardware or technology; (iii) use of a superseded or altered release of any of the Application IP, if You failed to use a then-current release of the Application IP we provided to you; (iv) Customer Content; or (v) Third Party Products (any of the foregoing circumstances under clauses (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv), or (v) an **"Indemnity Exclusion"**). THIS IS PROCTORIO'S ENTIRE OBLIGATION AND LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION CLAIMS, AND PROCTORIO'S LIABILITY UNDER THIS SECTION SHALL NOT EXCEED PROCTORIO'S LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY.

To the extent allowable by law You agree to hold harmless, indemnify, and, at Proctorio's option, defend Proctorio from and against any losses, liabilities, costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees) or damages resulting from: (i) Your or any Authorized User's negligence or willful misconduct; (ii) Your or any Authorized User's unauthorized use of the Application IP; (iii) third-party claims arising from Your alleged violations of law; or (iv) a an Indemnity Exclusion, provided Proctorio promptly notifies You in writing of the claim, cooperates with You, and allows You sole authority to control the defense and settlement of such claim; provided however You will not settle any third-party claim against Proctorio without Proctorio's consent.

13. K-12 Institutions.


--------------------------

We recognize that certain privacy protections apply specifically to minors, and accordingly have implemented additional privacy and security protections in place for minor users. If you are accessing and using the Services as a representative of a K-12 Institution, as a parent of a child attending a K-12 Institution (collectively, "Minor Representative"), or as the minor child who has been given parental permission by a parent, the following terms will also apply to you.

A. **Student Users.** Minor students agree that they have obtained consent from a parent/legal guardian for their use of the Site and Services in connection with educational uses. By using the Site and Services, if you are a minor, you represent that you have obtained consent from your parent/legal guardian who has read and agrees to this Agreement on your behalf. If you do not obtain such consent, then you are not authorized to use the Site or the Services.

B. **Parents and Guardians.** As a parent or guardian, you represent and warrant that you are over the age of majority; that you are entering into this Agreement on your behalf and on the behalf of your minor student, and that you have authority to bind you and your minor students to the terms herein. You acknowledge and agree that minor students cannot use the Site and Services without a parent/legal guardian first accepting this Agreement on their behalf. To the extent your minor student needs to set up an account, you, as the parent or guardian are responsible for doing so, and are responsible for both all information provided in setting up that account, and all actions taken by the minor student using that account.

C. **Collection of Student Information.** Proctorio's Services only collect the personal information from K-12 students that is needed for the operation and management of the Services, and only where the educational institution has contracted with Proctorio to do so. We first require that the educational institution (i) obtain the consent of parents/legal guardians prior to collecting such information or (ii) consent on their behalf. Further information concerning how K-12 student information is handled can be found in Proctorio's [Privacy Policy](https://proctorio.com/privacy).

14. Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability.


-------------------------------------------------

This section limits the liability of Proctorio and its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, related companies, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, partners, and licensors (collectively, the "**Proctorio Entities**") and You. Each of the subsections below only applies up to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties or the limitation of liability in contracts, and as a result the contents of this section may not apply to You. Nothing in this section is intended to limit any rights You may have which may not be lawfully limited.

### A. The Services are Available "AS-IS"

Except as otherwise stated in these Terms or a SaaS Agreement, You access and use the Services and Content at Your own risk. Except as otherwise stated in these Terms or a SaaS Agreement, You understand and agree that Proctorio provides these Services and Content to You on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, and except as otherwise stated in these Terms or a SaaS Agreement, THE PROCTORIO ENTITIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from the Proctorio Entities or through the Services or Content, will create any warranty not expressly made herein.

### B. Links

The Services may contain links to third-party websites or resources. You acknowledge and agree that the Proctorio Entities are not responsible or liable for: (i) the availability or accuracy of such websites or resources; or (ii) the content, products, or services on or available from such websites or resources. Links to such websites or resources do not imply any endorsement by the Proctorio Entities of such websites or resources or the content, products, or services available from such websites or resources. You acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from Your use of any such websites or resources.

### C. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AND THE PROCTORIO ENTITIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM: (i) YOUR ACCESS TO,USE OF, OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES OR CONTENT; (ii) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE, OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; (iii) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICES; OR (iv) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT.

EXCEPT FOR INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS AS STATED IN THESE TERMS, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF AUTHORIZED USERS OR THE PROCTORIO ENTITIES EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00) OR, FOR AN INSTITUTION THE AMOUNT INSTITUTION PAID TO PROCTORIO IN THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS.

THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SUBSECTION SHALL APPLY TO ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE PROCTORIO ENTITIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

15. General Terms.


----------------------

### A. English Language.

In case of conflict, the English language version of any agreement or notice shall control.

### B. U.S. Government Institution Representatives and Test Takers.

Each of the Application Documentation and the software components constituting the Application Service is a "commercial item" as defined in 48 C.F.R. § 2.101, consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212. Consistent with 48 C.F.R. § 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. §§ 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, all U.S. Government end users acquire the Application Service and the Application Documentation with only those rights set forth therein.

### C. Notices. - U.S.

All notices required under an applicable U.S. SaaS Agreement shall be in writing and sent by certified mail or email; to the address provided on the SaaS Agreement, and to Proctorio, Inc. at:

Proctor.io, Inc.  
7340 E Main St.,  
Suite 203  
Scottsdale, AZ 85257  
Email: [notices@proctorio.com](mailto:notices@proctorio.com)

### C. Notices. - Other

All notices required under an applicable SaaS Agreement shall be in writing and sent by certified mail or email; to the address provided on the SaaS Agreement, and to Proctorio GmbH at:

Proctorio GmbH  
Lindleystraße 8A  
60314 Frankfurt am Main  
Germany

Email: [notices@proctorio.de](mailto:notices@proctorio.de)

### D. Assignment; Delegation.

If You entered into a SaaS Agreement with Proctorio, You may assign Your rights and duties under the SaaS Agreement, with thirty days prior written notice to Proctorio. Proctorio may assign any SaaS Agreement, without consent, in the event of a change of control event. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

### E. Payment; Refunds.

To the extent the Services or any portion thereof is made available for any fee or through a subscription, your access will be granted following payment of the applicable fees to Company. Your account and access to the Services may be suspended in the event of non-payment of applicable fees. You represent and warrant to Company that such payment information is true and that you are authorized to use the payment instrument. If You are using a payment instrument held in the name of a third party, you agree to communicate Proctorio's policy on payments and refunds set forth in this Section 15(E) to such third party. For recurring subscriptions, you will promptly update your account information with any changes (for example, a change in your billing address or credit card expiration date) that may occur.

If your access to the Services is not under an Institution SaaS contract, your payments are due under the a pay as you go, End User-pay model. This means that You are invoiced by the Company based on the then-stated fees associated with such usage. When you create your account, you will have three payment options: (1) put a card on file with the Company, (2) accept monthly invoices, or (3) End User-pay per usage. Option (2) is only available if you complete an addendum document with the Company.

In the event an Institution's payment method stops working for any reason, the Institution's payment method will automatically revert to End User-pay, meaning the End User will become directly financially responsible for their access to the Services. In that circumstance, Institution understands and agrees that it shall be solely and completely responsible for any and all requests from End Users for refunds. Institution further agrees to hold harmless, indemnify, and, at Proctorio's option, defend Proctorio from and against any losses, liabilities, costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees) or damages resulting from any claims from any End User resulting from any failure of Institution's payment method with Proctorio for the Services.

All payments are nonrefundable. In certain circumstances, we may provide a refund to an End User who purchases the Services directly from Proctorio who can demonstrate that they no longer require the Services because they either (1) dropped the program which required use of the Services, or (2) are no longer enrolled in an Institution. Should You believe you are entitled to a refund because either of these circumstances apply to You, please contact our support team within 90 days at [refunds@proctorio.com](mailto:refunds@proctorio.com).

If You see a charge on a card or bank statement for a purchase from Proctorio that You did not make, please first check with your family and friends to see if they made the purchase. Once You've confirmed that the charge was not made by anyone You know, please report the charge to our support team at [refunds@proctorio.com](mailto:refunds@proctorio.com) within 90 days of the transaction.

When You purchase Services, a receipt is automatically sent to your email, and the charge will appear on your credit card statement as "Proctorio."

If You dispute a charge, Proctorio will provide evidence to the payment processor, including a copy of the agreement You accepted before completing the purchase. This agreement includes your signature, which may be either typed or drawn on the screen.

Charge disputes often occur when a cardholder does not recognize a transaction. If the dispute is due to unauthorized use, such as a stolen credit card, the chargeback may be valid. However, disputes initiated to avoid payment will be contested by Proctorio with supporting evidence.

To prevent unnecessary disputes, we encourage You to review your purchase details and contact our support team with any questions before initiating a chargeback.

The amount and the decision to provide a refund will be made by Proctorio in its sole and absolute discretion. If You receive a refund for any reason, Proctorio reserves the right to terminate Your access to the relevant Services.

Proctorio may suspend or cancel payment or refuse a refund request if we find evidence of fraud, abuse, or unlawful or other manipulative behavior.

### F. Advertising.

If You entered into a SaaS Agreement with Proctorio, and gave prior written consent, we may reference and use Your name and trademarks (only in a manner consistent with Your brand requirements and such use subject to Your prior review and approval), and disclose Proctorio's services for business development and marketing efforts, including on our website. Proctorio will not use any Customer Content to advertise or market to students or their parents. Proctorio does not sell or otherwise transfer your data to any third party except as specifically stated in these Terms or Privacy Policy.

### G. Independent Contractors.

You and Proctorio will, at all times, act as independent contractors, and nothing contained in these Terms, or any other agreement, will be construed or implied to create an agency, partnership, or employer and employee relationship.

### H. Waiver and Severability.

The failure of Proctorio or You to enforce any right or provision of these Terms, or any other applicable agreement, will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms, or any other applicable agreement, is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.

### I. Governing Law and Venue. - Other

These Terms, any action related thereto, and all other agreements between You and Proctorio, unless otherwise stated, will be governed by Delaware State Law without regard to or application of its conflict of law provisions or Your state or country of residence. All claims for injunctive relief and the administration of any arbitration proceedings shall be brought and/or conducted solely in Maricopa County, Arizona. You consent to the jurisdiction and venue of any such proceedings and waive any objection as to an inconvenient forum.

### I. Governing Law and Venue.

These Terms, any action related thereto, and all other agreements between You and Proctorio, unless otherwise stated, will be governed exclusively by German law to the exclusion of the UN Sales Convention. All claims for injunctive relief and the administration of any arbitration proceedings shall be brought and/or conducted solely in the place of business of the Company. You consent to the jurisdiction and venue of any such proceedings and waive any objection as to an inconvenient forum.

### J. Dispute Resolution. - U.S.
