Privacy Policy

At Zillow ("Zillow" or "we" or "us" or "our"), we appreciate your use of and contributions to our Web sites (defined to include all properties (mobile, web or otherwise) owned and operated by Zillow) and features (known as the "services"). Zillow respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information.

This is our privacy policy and we will comply with it, as well as applicable U.S. privacy law, when we gather and use information from users of our services. We encourage you to read this privacy policy to understand what we do with the information we collect from you.

Advertising-Supported Business Model

The Zillow Web sites and our extensive set of features are generally funded through advertising dollars.  
This advertising revenue helps keep Zillow free of charge for our user community. It also allows us to explore and build new features.

We strive to make advertisements relevant and useful to you. Therefore, we may serve advertisements to you based on the information we collect from you or in relation to your interaction on our site.

We pledge to be transparent about the information we monitor and collect from you. We keep information private between you and Zillow, except as explained below.

Collection of Information

When you use Zillow's Web sites, we collect a variety of information.

*   **Information you provide.** When using our Web sites and services, you may provide information about yourself, such as name, address, phone number and e-mail. This may occur when you register on Zillow, claim a home, or complete other forms, such as a loan request. We may combine this information with other information we collect from your activity on our Web sites or from other companies. You may also provide information about a third party on a Zillow Web site, for example, if you share a real estate listing with a recipient via email.
    
    In addition, when you order products or services from Zillow Web sites, Zillow may collect your credit/debit card information. Zillow will use this information solely to complete your order and will not share this information with outside parties, except to the extent necessary to complete the order or comply with applicable law.
    
    In the event that a credit report is required to use a Zillow product or service, Zillow may collect your social security number ("SSN"). Zillow restricts access to SSNs to employees, vendors and subcontractors who require SSNs to support certain products and services. Zillow strives to protect SSNs from unlawful disclosure and to keep them confidential by maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with applicable state and federal regulations.
    
*   **Cookies and Web beacons.** Cookies are bits of electronic information that can be transferred to a computer to uniquely identify that computer's browser. When you visit our Web sites and use our services, we may place one or more cookies on your computer. The use of cookies helps us improve the quality of our services to you, by identifying information which is most interesting to you, tracking trends, or storing information you may want to retrieve on a regular basis, such as your favorite homes. At any time, you may adjust settings on your browser to refuse cookies. However, if you choose to disable cookies, many of the free features and services on Zillow will not operate properly. Also, the pages of our service may include Web beacons, which are electronic files to count users who have visited that page or to identify certain cookies on the computer accessing that page. Some pages on our Web sites may use third-party Web beacons from Yahoo! In addition to our use of the data to analyze visitor activity on our Web sites, Yahoo! may use anonymous information about your visit in order to improve its products and services and to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you.
*   **Third-party cookies.** We work with service providers and advertising networks to track and manage cookie information and your activities while you're on Zillow or using our services. You may opt-out of cookie tracking and analysis from any of these ad networks by Opting Out of Collection of Information, which is explained further below.
*   **Usage logs.** When you use the services, your computer communicates a variety of information to computer servers, including the existence of cookies, your Internet Protocol address, and information about your browser program. We also create a record of what information you are requesting, such as the page or subject areas you're visiting.
*   **Calls.** Calls to Zillow or to third parties through Zillow may be recorded or monitored for quality assurance and customer service purposes. If a call is recorded between you and a third party, it will be deemed private information of both you and the third party, and may be released to either of you.

Usage and Disclosure

In general, Zillow uses the information collected from you to communicate with you and operate our features and services. Zillow also uses this information to present you with advertising that we believe will be of interest or useful to you.

Your privacy is important and we are committed to protecting information that identifies you personally, where you have chosen to keep it private. We will only share personal information that you provide outside the public areas of our services in the following circumstances:

*   **Consent.** When you consent or direct Zillow to share the information. For example, if you choose to contact a real estate agent or lender through Zillow, your name and e-mail address will appear to the recipient of the message.
*   **Service providers to Zillow.** When Zillow hires a service provider to help operate the services or our business, Zillow may give access to personal data only as necessary to perform the service for Zillow, and subject to the terms of this privacy policy.
*   **Legal obligation or protection from harm.** When Zillow has a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the personal information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any requirement of law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce or investigate a potential violation of the Terms of Use, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise respond to fraud, security or technical concerns, or (d) protect the rights, property, or safety of Zillow, its users, or the public against harm.
*   **Merger or sale.** If and when Zillow is involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its business, personal information may be transferred along with the business

When you provide public information without identifying yourself, we will protect your personal identity as described above. If your account profile does not identify you personally, Zillow won't reveal your identity to third parties except in accordance with this policy.

When we deliver ads based on data about your use of the services, we keep your identity anonymous. We won't identify you personally to third parties, except in accordance with this privacy policy. Of course, if you choose to respond to an advertised offer with your name and contact information, you will no longer be anonymous to the advertiser.

Some Things are Not Covered

This privacy policy will not apply to the following:

*   **Public posting.** You should keep in mind that the information that you choose to provide in a public area of the services (such as your profile page or the discussion forums) will not be protected by this privacy policy because you have made an active choice to make that information public.
*   **Real estate information.** Zillow strives to provide open and transparent information about real estate markets. As a result, we make available past sales prices for homes, and allow any user to post a question or answer about a given home. Many times, this information is already publicly available. As long as discussion surrounds real estate and not individuals, we intend to keep this information freely available on our Web sites. Where a professional participates in the Zillow community, we may also allow users to comment on the professional, such as the lender ratings in the Zillow Mortgage Marketplace.
*   **Aggregated non-personal information and other information without personal identification.** While we do not share your personal information with third parties unless permitted above, Zillow may share aggregate anonymous information with third-parties. This information does not personally identify individuals, but instead provides a helpful understanding of the groups of people who prefer certain types of information and services.
