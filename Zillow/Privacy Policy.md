You may also have additional choices regarding your personal data depending on your state of residency. Please refer to our “U.S. State Privacy Disclosures” below for information about additional privacy choices that may be available to you. You may take action regarding your personal data in our [Privacy Portal](https://www.privacy.zillowgroup.com/).

**Third-Party Tracking and Interest-Based Advertising** 

We may participate in interest-based advertising and use third party advertising companies to serve you targeted advertisements based on your browsing history. We may permit third party online advertising networks, social media companies, and other third-party services to collect information about your use of our websites, including our mobile apps, over time so that they may play or display ads on our services, on other websites, apps, or services you may use, and on other devices you may use. Typically, though not always, the information used for interest-based advertising is collected through tracking technologies, such as cookies, web beacons or pixels, embedded scripts, mobile SDKs, location-identifying technologies, and similar technology (collectively, “tracking technologies”), which recognize the device you are using and collect information, including clickstream information, browser type, time and date you visited the site, device ID or AdID, geolocation, and other information. We may share a common account identifier (such as an e-mail address or user ID) or hashed data with our third-party advertising partners to help identify you across devices. We and our third-party partners may use this information to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics, and market research.

We, or our third-party partners, may link your various devices so that content you see on one device can result in relevant advertising on another device. We may share a common account identifier (such as a hashed email address or user ID) or work with third-party partners who use tracking technologies or statistical modeling tools to determine if two or more devices are linked to a single user or household. We, and our partners, can use this cross-device linkage to serve interest-based advertising and other personalized content to you across your devices (including to improve your user experience), to perform analytics, and to measure the performance of our advertising campaigns.

**Your Choices**. As noted above, depending on your browser or mobile device, you may be able to set your browser to delete or notify you of cookies and other tracking technology by actively managing the settings on your browser or mobile device. You can also manage cookies by clicking the “Cookie Preference” link at the bottom of our websites. You may be able to limit interest-based advertising through the settings on your mobile device by selecting “limit ad tracking” (iOS) or “opt-out of interest based ads” (Android). Please note that opt-outs are browser specific, so opting out on one browser will not affect a second browser, or device. Moreover, if you buy a new device, use a different browser, or clear all your cookies, you will have to opt out all over again. To learn more about interest-based advertising and how you may be able to opt-out of some of this advertising, you may wish to visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s online resources, at [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices), and/or the DAA’s resources at [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices). You may also be able to opt-out of some – but not all – interest-based ads served by mobile ad networks by visiting [http://youradchoices.com/appchoices](http://youradchoices.com/appchoices) and downloading the mobile AppChoices app. Note that some of these opt-outs may not be effective unless your browser is set to accept cookies. If you delete cookies, change your browser settings, switch browsers or computers, or use another operating system, you may need to opt-out again.

**Retention**

We strive to retain your personal data only for as long as is reasonably necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected and in accordance with applicable laws. The following is considered in determining appropriate retention periods: 

* The length of time you maintain a user account or use our services.
* Obligations with legal, tax, and/or accounting requirements set by a legislature, regulator, or other government authority.
* Support of dispute resolution and claims processes.
* Compliance with litigation holds, contractual obligations, statutes of limitations, regulatory investigations, or other laws requiring us to keep records of your transactions with us.

Once retention of your personal data is no longer necessary for the purposes outlined above, we will either delete or de-identify the personal data. We may retain copies of your personal data in backup archives.  In these cases, your personal data is stored securely and isolated from further processing until deletion or de-identification is possible. Should our systems need to be restored with backups, unnecessary personal data will be deleted at the time of restoration.

**Children’s Personal Data**

Our websites and online services are not directed to, and we do not intend to or knowingly collect or solicit personal data from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not use our websites or online services or otherwise provide us with any personal data either directly or by other means. If a child under the age of 13 has provided personal data to us, we encourage the child’s parent or guardian to contact us as described below to request that we remove the personal data from our systems. If we learn that any personal data we collect has been provided by a child under the age of 13, we will promptly delete that personal data.

**Region-Specific Disclosures**

We may choose or be required by law to provide different or additional disclosures relating to the processing of personal data about residents of certain countries, regions, or states. Please see below for disclosures that may be applicable to you:

* If you are a resident of a state that grants you specific privacy rights, please see below for U.S. state-specific privacy disclosures.

* Zillow allows certain companies to place tracking technologies like cookies and pixels on our sites, which allow those companies to receive information about your activity on Zillow that is associated with your browser or device. The companies may use that data to serve you more relevant ads on our sites or others. 
* Zillow may share your information to third parties in order to help us find similar audiences who may be similarly interested in our services.

Except for this kind of selling or sharing, Zillow doesn’t otherwise sell any of your personal data.

You always have control over whether tracking technologies work on your devices. At any time, you can use our cookie preference tools (see “Cookie Preferences” linked in our websites’ footer) to manage what kinds of cookies and other tracking technologies you’re comfortable with. See our [Privacy Portal](https://www.privacy.zillowgroup.com/) for information about how to access these tools. You can also disable cookies altogether by adjusting the settings on your browser.

You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your Right to Opt-Out. However, we may ask you to provide additional personal data so that we can properly identify you to track compliance with your opt-out request. We will only use personal data provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.

If you are visiting our site with the Global Privacy Control enabled, any cookies that constitute sales or are used for targeted advertising should already be turned off automatically in our cookie preference manager (see “Cookie Preference” link in the footer of our websites). Please note this opt-out tool is website-, device-, and browser-specific, so you will need to change your preferences on each device and browser you use to interact with the specific website you are visiting.

Depending on the evidence provided and your state of residence, we may still need to separately reach out to you to confirm the authorized agent has permission to act on your behalf and to verify your identity in connection with the request.
