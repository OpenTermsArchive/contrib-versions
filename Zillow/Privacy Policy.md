**Effective Date:** January 2023

When you use Zillow Group services to find, buy, rent, or sell your home, get a mortgage, or connect to a real estate pro, we know you’re trusting us with your data. We also know we have a responsibility to respect your privacy, and we work hard to do just that.

We periodically revise this Notice to reflect new and evolving laws that govern privacy. This Privacy Notice is not a contract and does not create any legal rights or obligations. 

**Who We Are**: Zillow Group offers a wide range of offerings that focus on all stages of your home journey: searching, renting, buying, selling, financing, and home improvement.

We carefully evaluate how we use data to make sure that we’re using your information to provide value **for you**. On this page, we aim to explain everything you need to know about your privacy at Zillow. If you have any questions that we haven’t answered here, you can always contact us at [privacy@zillow.com](mailto:privacy@zillow.com).

* Our corporate websites that link to this Privacy Notice;
* Rental tools; 
* Connections (such as connecting you to a lender or agent); and

**What is Personal Data?**

When we use the term “personal data” in this Privacy Notice, we mean information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to an individual or household. It does not include aggregated or de-identified information that is maintained in a form that is not capable of being associated with or reasonably linked to an individual.

**Our Collection and Use of Personal Data**

The personal data we collect, the way we collect it, and how we use it will depend on how you are interacting with us and the type of services you use.

**Information We Collect As You Use Our Services**

_Collection of Personal Data_

This includes things like your home search history, homes you view, purchase activity, what you’ve clicked on and other uses of our websites, and the amount of time you spend looking at different parts of our websites.

Specifically, we and our third party partners may use tracking technologies to automatically collect commercial information, preferences, and internet, network and device information, including: 

* **Information about how you access our services**, such as the website from which you came and the website to which you are going when you leave our websites, how frequently you access the services, when and whether you open emails or click the links contained in emails, whether you access the services from multiple devices and other actions you take on the services.
* **Information about how you use the services**, such as the pages you visit, the links you click, the ads you view and click on, purchase information and your checkout process, your location when you access or interact with our services, and other similar actions.

* **Analytics Data**, such as information about your activity when you visit our sites or use our apps; this can include clicks, mouse movements, forms you fill out, and similar information.

When you use Zillow, we and our partners may use cookies and other tools to gather information about how you view and use our services and content, and to connect your activity with other data we store about you. The use of cookies helps us serve you better by understanding what you’re interested in, tracking trends, measuring the effectiveness of ads, saving your preferences, and storing information you may want to retrieve on a regular basis, such as your favorite homes. We also allow approved partners to collect data from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar tools; these are categorized as “Advertising Cookies,” and you can choose whether to disable them via either our [Privacy Center](https://privacy.zillowgroup.com/cookie) or the “Cookie Preference” link at the bottom of our websites.

This information allows us to improve your customer experience. For example, we may use this information to enhance and personalize your user experience, to monitor and improve our websites and services, and for other internal purposes.  We may also use this information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Sites; (b) provide custom, personalized content, and information; (c) identify and contact you across multiple devices; (d) provide and monitor the effectiveness of our services; (e) perform analytics and detect usage patterns on our services; (f) diagnose or fix technology problems; (g) detect or prevent fraud or other harmful activities; and (h) otherwise to plan for and enhance our services.

**Choices About Your Data**

**Profile Access and Data Sharing**. You may access and update your profile information, such as your user name, address, or billing information, and may change some of your data sharing preferences on your account page. 

**Location and Device Permissions**. You may control location tracking by adjusting your location services options on the “Settings” app on your mobile device.  We may continue to approximate your location based on your IP address when you access the services through a computer or device. If you would like to update your device content access permissions, such as permissions to access your camera, you can do so in the “Settings” app on your mobile device.

**Promotional Messages**. You can stop receiving promotional email communications from us by following the “unsubscribe” instructions provided in such communications.  We make every effort to promptly process all unsubscribe requests. You may still receive service-related communications, including account verification, transactional communications, changes/updates to features of the services, and technical and security notices.

**Third Party Tracking and Interest-Based Advertising**. We participate in interest-based advertising and use third party advertising companies to serve you targeted advertisements based on your browsing history. To learn more about our advertising practices and your choices relating to advertising, please see “[Third-Party Tracking and Interest-Based Advertising](#third-party).”

**Third-Party Tracking and Interest-Based Advertising** 

We may participate in interest-based advertising and use third party advertising companies to serve you targeted advertisements based on your browsing history. We may permit third party online advertising networks, social media companies, and other third-party services to collect information about your use of our websites, including our mobile apps, over time so that they may play or display ads on our services, on other websites, apps, or services you may use, and on other devices you may use. Typically, though not always, the information used for interest-based advertising is collected through tracking technologies, such as cookies, Flash objects, web beacons, embedded scripts, mobile SDKs, location-identifying technologies, and similar technology (collectively, “tracking technologies”), which recognize the device you are using and collect information, including clickstream information, browser type, time and date you visited the site, device ID or AdID, geolocation, and other information. We may share a common account identifier (such as an e-mail address or user ID) or hashed data with our third-party advertising partners to help identify you across devices. We and our third-party partners may use this information to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics, and market research.

We, or our third-party partners, may link your various devices so that content you see on one device can result in relevant advertising on another device. We may share a common account identifier (such as a hashed email address or user ID) or work with third-party partners who use tracking technologies or statistical modeling tools to determine if two or more devices are linked to a single user or household. We, and our partners, can use this cross-device linkage to serve interest-based advertising and other personalized content to you across your devices (including to improve your user experience), to perform analytics, and to measure the performance of our advertising campaigns.

In some of our offerings, including our mobile applications, we provide you with the option of logging in using an account that you may have with a social-media service, such as Apple, Google, or Facebook. For this type of log-in, you will be directed to the appropriate social-media log-in page, where you will enter your username and password (or account credentials) for the social-media service. (Through a social-media log-in, the social media service may know when you have used our offering.) The social media-service will then send us a token, which we will use to authenticate you for access. The social-media service may also share your name and email address with us, although we will not have access to your social-media account credentials. We may keep the token and your name and email address for purposes of identifying you, which enables us to maintain your preferences in our offering across different devices. As an example, by identifying you using this information, we can present to you your previous searches and saved properties in our mobile applications, even if you access the applications from different devices.  Keeping this information also makes it possible for us to pre-populate your name and email in certain interfaces, such as log-in fields or contact forms.      

**Your Choices**

As noted above, depending on your browser or mobile device, you may be able to set your browser to delete or notify you of cookies and other tracking technology by actively managing the settings on your browser or mobile device. You may be able to limit interest-based advertising through the settings on your mobile device by selecting “limit ad tracking” (iOS) or “opt-out of interest based ads” (Android).  Please note that opt-outs are browser specific, so opting out on one browser will not affect a second browser, or device. Moreover, if you buy a new device, use a different browser, or clear all your cookies, you will have to opt out all over again. To learn more about interest-based advertising and how you may be able to opt-out of some of this advertising, you may wish to visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s online resources, at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices, and/or the DAA’s resources at www.aboutads.info/choices. You may also be able to opt-out of some – but not all – interest-based ads served by mobile ad networks by visiting http://youradchoices.com/appchoices and downloading the mobile AppChoices app. Note that some of these opt-outs may not be effective unless your browser is set to accept cookies. If you delete cookies, change your browser settings, switch browsers or computers, or use another operating system, you may need to opt-out again.

**Children’s Personal Data**

Our websites and online services are not directed to, and we do not intend to or knowingly collect or solicit personal data from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not use our websites or online services or otherwise provide us with any personal data either directly or by other means. If a child under the age of 13 has provided personal data to us, we encourage the child’s parent or guardian to contact us as described below to request that we remove the personal data from our systems. If we learn that any personal data we collect has been provided by a child under the age of 13, we will promptly delete that personal data.

**Region-Specific Disclosures**

We may choose or be required by law to provide different or additional disclosures relating to the processing of personal data about residents of certain countries, regions, or states. Please see below for disclosures that may be applicable to you:

* If you are a resident of the State of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, or Virginia in the United States, please see below for additional U.S. state-specific privacy disclosures.

**Third-Party Websites**

Our websites and online services may include links to or redirect you to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications, including social media services where you may connect with us. Third-party websites may also reference or link to our websites and online services. Except where we post, link to, or expressly adopt or refer to this Privacy Notice, this Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, any personal data practices of third-party websites and online services or the practices of other third parties. To learn about the personal data practices of these third parties, please visit their respective privacy notices or policies.

To submit a request to exercise one of the privacy rights identified above, please:

* Navigate to our [**Privacy Center**](https://www.privacy.zillowgroup.com/); or 
* Email us at [privacy@zillow.com](mailto:privacy@zillow.com).

We may need to verify your identity before processing your request. In order to submit a request, you’ll need to log in to your account with us so we can verify your identity. If you can’t log in or don’t have an account, we may not be able to link you to any personal data of yours on our systems, but we’ll do our best. In certain circumstances, we may decline a request to exercise the rights described above, particularly where we are unable to verify your identity or locate your information in our systems. We will use personal data provided in connection with a Rights Request only to review and comply with the request.

_To Exercise Your Right to Opt-Out of Personal Data Sales or Sharing for Targeted Advertising_ 

Unless you have exercised your Right to Opt-Out, we may disclose your personal data to third parties who may use such information for their own purposes in accordance with their own privacy policies.  Under some state laws, disclosing personal data for online advertising like this may be considered a “sale of personal data” or “sharing for targeted advertising.”

Zillow allows certain companies to place tracking technologies like cookies and pixels on our sites, which allow those companies to receive information about your activity on Zillow that is associated with your browser or device. The companies may use that data to serve you more relevant ads on our sites or others. Except for this kind of selling or sharing, Zillow doesn’t otherwise sell any of your personal data.  You always have control over whether these technologies work on your devices. At any time, you can use our cookie preference tools to manage what kinds of cookies and other tracking technologies you’re comfortable with. Check out our Privacy Center for information about how to access these tools. You can also disable cookies altogether by adjusting the settings on your browser. However, if you choose to disable some or all cookies, many parts of our services may no longer work. For more information, see the “[Third-Party Tracking and Interest-Based Advertising](#third-party)” section in the Privacy Notice. 

You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your Right to Opt-Out. However, we may ask you to provide additional personal data so that we can properly identify you to track compliance with your opt-out request. We will only use personal data provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request. If you choose not to provide this data, we may be able to process your request only to the extent we are able to identify you in our data systems.

To exercise the Right to Opt Out of Personal Information Sales or Sharing: Navigate to our [**Privacy Center**](https://privacy.zillowgroup.com/) or email [privacy@zillow.com](mailto:privacy@zillow.com) with sufficient information to identify you and your request. 

**Submitting Authorized Agent Requests**

In certain circumstances, you are permitted by law to use an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf through the designated methods set forth above where we can verify the authorized agent’s authority to act on your behalf. In order to verify the authorized agent’s authority, we generally require evidence of either: (i) a valid power of attorney; or (ii) a signed letter containing your name and contact information, the name and contact information of the authorized agent, and a statement of authorization for the request. Depending on the evidence provided and your state of residence, we may still need to separately reach out to you to confirm the authorized agent has permission to act on your behalf and to verify your identity in connection with the request. 

**Appealing Privacy Rights Decisions**

Depending on your state of residence, you may be able to appeal a decision we have made in connection with your privacy rights request. All appeal requests should be submitted via email to [](mailto:zgprivacy@zillowgroup.com)[privacy@zillow.com](mailto:privacy@zillow.com). 

**Minors**

We do not sell the personal data of consumers we know to be less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the “Right to Opt In”) from either the minor who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a minor less than 13 years of age.

If you are under the age of 18 and you want to remove your name or comments from our website or publicly displayed content, please contact us directly at [privacy@zillow.com](mailto:privacy@zillow.com). We may not be able to modify or delete your information in all circumstances.

If you wish to submit a privacy request on behalf of your minor child in accordance with applicable jurisdictional laws, you must provide sufficient information to allow us to reasonably verify your child is the person about whom we collected personal information and you are authorized to submit the request on your child’s behalf (i.e., you are the child’s legal guardian or authorized representative).

**California-Specific Disclosures**

The following disclosures only apply to residents of the State of California.

_California Categories of Personal Data_

California law requires we provide disclosures to you about what personal data we collect by reference to the enumerated categories of personal data set forth within California law. To address this obligation, we have identified the relevant enumerated California personal data category for the personal data, sources and purposes described in the “[Our Collection and Use of Personal Data](#data-use)” section of our Privacy Notice below:

We collect this data from the following sources: directly from you, from our business partners and affiliates, from your browser or device when you visit our mobile app(s) or use our Services, or from third parties that you permit to share information with us. Please see “[Our Collection and Use of Personal Data](#data-use)” section of our Privacy Notice for more information about the sources of personal data we collect. We disclose all of these categories of personal data for a business purpose to service providers or other third parties at the consumer’s direction, as outlined in the “[Our Disclosure of Personal Data](#data-disclosure)” section of our Privacy Notice.

_Retention of Personal Data_ 

We strive to retain your personal data only for as long as is reasonably necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected. However, if necessary, we may retain your personal data for longer periods of time, until set retention periods and deadlines expire, for instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, tax and/or accounting requirements set by a legislature, regulator, or other government authority.

To determine the appropriate duration of the retention of personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of personal data and if we can attain our objectives by other means, as well as our legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, and other applicable obligations.

Therefore, we retain personal data for as long as you use our services for the purposes explained in our Privacy Notice, including maintaining a user account. When you discontinue the use of our services, we will retain your personal data for as long as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes and defend claims, as well as for any additional purpose based on the choices you have made, such as to receive marketing communications.

Once retention of your personal data is no longer necessary for the purposes outlined above, we will either delete or de-identify the personal data or, if this is not possible (for example, because personal data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from further processing until deletion or deidentification is possible.

_“Shine the Light” Disclosures_

The California “Shine the Light” law gives residents of California the right under certain circumstances to request information from us regarding the manner in which we share certain categories of personal information (as defined in the Shine the Light law) with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To opt out of this type of sharing, please visit our [Privacy Center](https://privacy.zillowgroup.com/) or email us at [privacy@zillow.com](mailto:privacy@zillow.com).
