### Personal information we collect about you

Directly from you

The information we collect about you and how we collect it can vary depending on the products and services that you use and subscribe to, how you have used the products and services, how you have interacted with Vodafone, even if you aren’t a customer, or what we have obtained from a third party.

We will collect your personal information when you, for example:

* sign up to any of our products or services;
    
* use our network or other Vodafone products or services;
    
* contact us through various channels for support or ask for information about products or services;
    
* visit or browse our website; and
    
* if you are a non-Vodafone customer and contact a Vodafone customer or a Vodafone customer care team.
    

From third parties

Information collected not directly from you:

* Information we obtain from other sources, such as credit agencies, fraud-prevention agencies, and from other data providers. This includes demographic data, interest-based data, and internet browsing behaviour.
    

The types of information we may have, where applicable:

1. Contact details: Such as your name, address, phone and/or mobile number and email address;
    
2. Financial details: Such as your credit or debit card information, information about your bank account and other banking information – for example, you’ll have to give us this information when you open an account with us. We’ll collect the data necessary to process a payment whenever you make a purchase;
    
3. Your traffic data: Every time you use your mobile phone, a record is kept. This includes the number you called or sent an SMS or MMS to, the length, date and time of that call, SMS or MMS, the amount of data you are using and your approximate location at the time that the communication takes place (based on the location of the nearest cell that you sent that call or message from). The same is also recorded every time you receive an incoming call or message. This is data we see as part of providing you with connectivity; we don’t, however, keep a record of the content of your calls or messages.
    
4. Information about your device or connectivity: such as IP address, IMEI and MSISDN.
    
5. Your location data: This can be precise where it uses Global Positioning System (GPS) data or by identifying nearby mobile phone masts and Wi-Fi hotspots and you enable location-based services or features. Or less precise where, for example, a location is derived from your IP address or data such as a post code or name of a town or city;
    
6. Your contact with us: Such as a note or recording of a call you make to one of our contact centres, a Live Chat, an email or letter sent, or other records of any contact with us;
    
7. Your account information: Such as your date of birth, gender, dates of payment owed or received, subscriptions you use, account numbers or other information related to your account or included in My Vodafone;
    
8. Credential information: We’ll collect passwords, hints, and similar security information used for authentication and access to accounts and services;
    
9. Your preferences: for products, services and lifestyle activities when you tell us what they are, or we assume what they are, based on how you use the products and services;
    
10. Cookies: See the [Cookie Policy](#cookies) for details on what we collect using cookies, web beacons and other technologies, including advertising data;
    
11. Your browsing history: If you have given your permission, Vodafone collects the categories of website you have browsed on your mobile, device or PC, for example Sports, Music or News. However, we don’t have a history of the sites you browse, as this is limited for a short period of time to enable the connection to be made. We use these interests to send you personalised marketing or show you personalised advertising. You can opt out of advertising and manage how we use cookies through the Cookie Settings which can be accessed via our [Cookies Policy](#cookies) or, in the case of marketing, your [Privacy Settings](#privacysettings).
    
12. Information about how you use our products and services: Such as the level of service that you receive – for example, network or service faults and other events that may affect our network services or other services; or your viewing history if you use our VTV product for example.
    
13. Details of your use of the specific services or products: for example CIOT devices or VTV. You can refer to the specific privacy supplement for each product/service for more information on the data processed.
    

### How we use your personal information and our lawful basis to do so

We will use your personal information for a number of purposes, ranging from enabling us to provide you with the products or services you have requested to ensuring we are keeping these secure from fraud.

We may use Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) to help us provide you with a requested product or service. If we use A.I. we will do so responsibly, and where necessary we will disclose that the content is generated by A.I.

Whenever we use your personal information, we do so based on a specific lawful basis under data protection law listed below:

1. The performance of your contract or to enter into the contract and to take action on your requests for example, so you can make calls and texts, and browse the internet on your phone, we process things like the numbers you dial, how much data you’re using and when you’re doing it so we can provide connectivity. This also enables us to generate your bill, based on your usage. We also may conduct credit checks when you apply for a product or service, which is operated on a bill pay basis to verify your suitability for entry into such a contract.
    
2. Legitimate interests of Vodafone for example, fraud prevention, maintaining the security of our network and services, direct marketing, and improvement of our services. Whenever we rely on this lawful basis to process your data, we assess our legitimate interests to make sure they do not override your rights. Additionally, in some cases you have the right to object to this processing. For more information, go to Your Rights at the end of this section.
    
3. Compliance with a mandatory legal obligation including for example accounting and tax requirements, which are subject to strict internal policies (such as retention periods), procedures.
    
4. Consent where you have provided it by your own free will. Consent may be withdrawn at any time. See Your Rights at the end of this section for more information on how to do this.
    

Please see the table below for more information.

Below you can find an overview of the categories of personal information we process about you, the purposes for which we process that personal information and the lawful basis upon which we rely to conduct that processing.

Third parties that we work with

We are not in the business of selling your data, we only share your data with suppliers who help us to provide services.

When you’ve purchased Vodafone products and services using a third party or partner organisation, we often need to exchange information with them as part of managing that relationship and your account – for example, to be able to identify your order and be able to pay them.

If we have a contract with a service provider or contractor to provide us with services or provide a service on our behalf, they may have access to your personal information. We don’t authorise them to use or disclose your personal information received from us except in connection with providing their services.

We collect and combine information in order to monitor your use of products and services, and that of our other customers, as well as to help us to improve the quality of our products and services. We provide this information to third parties (for example, to content providers and advertisers), but any such third-party reporting shall not include information which may identify an individual customer.

Mergers and Acquisitions

If we reorganised or merged with or divested part of our business to another organisation, we may need to provide your information to that other organisation or their advisers or receive personal information from that other organisation.

Third party devices that you connect your SIM with

You may connect your SIM with a number of third-party devices, either manually with a SIM card or electronically through our One Number product. These may include mobile phone devices or connected devices such as smart speakers or smartwatches. When you connect your SIM with these devices, those third parties may record your SIM details or your interaction with the network and provide that information to Vodafone for purposes of validating your eligibility for the OneNumber product offering. Those third-party device manufacturers will process your personal data in accordance with their requirements and we recommend that you read their privacy notices / policies before choosing to connect your sim to their devices.

Third party products that you buy through your Vodafone account

Where you buy a third-party product or service through your Vodafone account (such as Charge to Bill for mobile), the contract for it is with the party selling that product or service. Vodafone is only charging the amount directly to your bill as part of its arrangements with the seller. As part of this, you’re agreeing that Vodafone may pass certain personal information to the seller to complete your purchase with them.

The seller’s terms and conditions, privacy and cookies policies will apply to how it uses your personal information – please read them carefully.

### To provide you with your service

It is necessary for us to process your personal information to enable us to provide you with your service. By service we mean any services or products that you buy or use such as broadband, mobiles, use of our apps or smart tech products.

### To improve our service

We collect information about your use of our products and services on an aggregated or anonymous basis in order to help us manage and improve the services we offer to everyone.

### Marketing and tailoring our service to you

We process your personal information for marketing and advertising purposes, such as to let you know about new products or services and send you special offers, as well as to help us tailor our service to you.

You can manage your marketing permissions, and your preferences for the data we use to tailor these communications at any time by visiting [Your Privacy Settings](#privacysettings).

### Profiling, Fraud Management and Security

Profiling consists of the use of personal data in an automated form in order to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to an individual. We will process your personal information in this way for credit, fraud, and security purposes.

### To comply with mandatory legal obligation

Under certain circumstances, it is necessary for us to process your personal information in order to comply with the law, for example, when responding to law enforcement requests for data or to comply with tax requirements.

### How we share your personal information

Where applicable, we share information about you with:

* Companies in the Vodafone Group
    
* Partners or agents involved in delivering the products and services you’ve ordered or used;
    
* Companies who are engaged to perform services for, or on behalf of, Vodafone Ireland Limited, or Vodafone Group;
    
* Credit reference, fraud-prevention or business-scoring agencies, or other credit scoring agencies;
    
* Debt collection agencies or other debt-recovery organisations;
    
* Law enforcement agencies, government bodies, regulatory organisations, courts or other public authorities if we have to, or are authorised to by law;
    
* A third party or body where such disclosure is required to satisfy any applicable law, or other legal or regulatory requirement;
    
* Emergency services (if you make an emergency call), including your approximate location;
    
* Third parties for joint promotions with that third party;
    
* Partner organisations we’ve carefully chosen so they can contact you about their products and services (which may or may not include Vodafone products and services). We’ll ask for your consent before sharing this information;
    
* Other third parties when you are signing up to their service and it is used by them for authentication and fraud-prevention purposes;
    
* Third parties that we advertise with, such as Facebook, in order to serve you advertisements online;
    
* Third parties that we use to serve you marketing.
    

### International Data Transfers

We may need to transfer your information to other Vodafone Group companies (for instance our Vodafone Intelligence Solutions centres located in Egypt, Hungary, Romania, Albania and India, who provide customer support) or service providers in countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA).

The EEA consists of countries in the European Union, Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway: they are considered to have equivalent laws when it comes to data protection and privacy.

This kind of data transfer will happen if our servers (i.e. where we store data) or our suppliers and service providers are based outside the EEA, or if you use our services and products while visiting countries outside this area.

If Vodafone sends your information to a country that is not in the EEA, we will make sure that your information is properly protected. We will always ensure to conduct a transfer impact assessment and ensure that there is a proper legal agreement that covers the data transfer. In addition, if the country is not considered to have laws that are equivalent to EU data protection standards or deemed adequate by the European Commission (see [list of adequacy decisions](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en)), then we will implement additional technical security and organisational safeguards such as asking the third party to enter into a legal agreement containing standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission that reflects those standards.

### How long we keep your personal information

We’ll store your information for as long as we must by law. If there’s no legal requirement, we’ll only store it for as long as we need to.

Subject to the above, the following specific retention periods will be followed:

We’ll keep some personal information for a reasonable period after your contract with us has finished in case you decide to use our services again; to allow us to answer any questions you might have after you cease your services, or for our own business and reporting requirements. We, or one of our partners, may contact you about Vodafone services during this time if you haven’t opted out of receiving marketing communications from us.

### Keeping your personal information secure

We have specialised security teams who constantly review and improve our measures to protect your personal information from unauthorised access, accidental loss, disclosure or destruction.

  
Communications over the internet (such as emails) are not secure unless they have been encrypted. Your communications may go through a number of countries before being delivered, as this is the nature of the internet.

  
We cannot accept responsibility for any unauthorised access or loss of personal information that is beyond our control.  
We’ll never ask for your secure personal or account information by an unsolicited means of communication. You’re responsible for keeping your personal and account information secure and not sharing it with others.

  
Our website may provide links to third-party websites. We cannot be responsible for the security and content of such third-party websites. So, make sure you read that company’s privacy and cookies policies before using or putting your personal information on their site.  
The same applies to any third-party websites or content you connect to using our products and services.

  
You may choose to disclose your information in certain ways such as social plug-ins (including those offered by Google, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest) or using third-party services that allow you to post reviews or other information publicly, and a third party could use that information.

  
Social plug-ins and social applications are operated by the social network themselves and are subject to their own terms of use and privacy and cookies policies. You should make sure you’re familiar with these.

### Your rights

Right to correct personal data

You have the right to have information held about you corrected if it is not accurate. If any of the information that we have on file relating to your account needs to be updated, or you think it may be inaccurate, you can log in to My Vodafone to update it ([Login > My account](https://n.vodafone.ie/home/login.html)) or contact our [Customer Services](https://n.vodafone.ie/support.html) team.  

Right to access personal data

You have the right to make a request for a copy of the personal data that Vodafone holds about you. To make this request as an individual or an authorised 3rd party, please fill out the [online form](https://binaries.vodafone.co.uk/tizrehont83j/122j4pENa7QlOO086rERsd/ea767982fdfa0a00b6ce07398a8c95e8/subject-access-request-form.pdf) or post it to the address on the form. Alternatively, you can contact the [Customer Services team](https://n.vodafone.ie/support.html). We will take reasonable steps to confirm your identity before issuing any copy of your personal information.  

Right to data portability

You have the right to be able to take with you data you provided to us in certain circumstances. For example, Vodafone ensures that you can take your data with you by allowing you to download your monthly bills, at the click of a button, in a format of your choice. To do this, log in to [My Vodafone](https://n.vodafone.ie/home/login.html) and go to your billing area. Some specific apps and services allow you to take out the informed stored by the user into Vodafone’s cloud and hosting services, for example Backup+.  

Right to restrict use of your data

If you feel the data we hold on you is inaccurate or believe we shouldn’t be processing your data, please contact our Customer Care team on 1907 to discuss your rights. In certain circumstances, you will have the right to ask us to restrict processing.  

Right to erasure

Vodafone strives to only process and retain your data for as long as we need to. In certain circumstances, you have the right to request that we erase personal data of yours that we hold. If you feel that we are retaining your data longer than we need, it is worth first checking that your contract with Vodafone has been terminated, which you can do by contacting our Customer Care team on 1907. If your contract with Vodafone has been terminated, we may still have lawful grounds to process your personal data (for more information on retention periods, see previous How Long We Keep Your Personal Information For).  

Right to object to processing where we rely on our legitimate interests:

Please contact our Customer Care team on 1907 or email us at [dataprotection.ie@vodafone.com](mailto:dataprotection.ie@vodafone.com).  

Right to withdraw consent

You can withdraw your consent anytime after giving it. Depending on how you provided your consent, you should be able to withdraw your consent in the same way. You can also contact our Customer Care team on 1907 or email us at [dataprotection.ie@vodafone.com](mailto:dataprotection.ie@vodafone.com).  

To opt out of Marketing messages

If you no longer want to receive marketing messages from Vodafone, you can elect to opt out of all marketing communications or only selected methods (email, SMS MMS, phone or post).

There are various ways to opt out:

* Log in to your Privacy Settings to manage your permissions; your [Privacy Settings](#privacysettings) will also provide you with the ability to opt out or into receiving personalised marketing.
    
* Contact our customer services team – see the [contact us page](https://n.vodafone.ie/support.html);
    
* Click the link at the end of a marketing email or text to unsubscribe;
    
* Tell the adviser if you receive a marketing call;
    
* Disable push notification messages, including marketing messages, at any time in our apps by changing the notification settings on your device or by uninstalling the app;
    

Email [dataprotection.ie@vodafone.com](mailto:dataprotection.ie@vodafone.com) for guidance.

Opting out does not mean that you won’t any longer receive service-related messages. You will continue to receive those (unless we have indicated otherwise).

To opt out of receiving marketing communications from other Vodafone Group companies, just contact them directly.

In some cases, you may receive marketing from Vodafone, even if you’re not a customer or never had contact with Vodafone. This is a result of third-party marketing lists which Vodafone may acquire from time to time. If you’ve registered to opt out of such marketing, you shouldn’t receive such communications. If you do, we ask that you let us know immediately.

How to lodge a complaint

If you want to contact us about any of your rights or to complain about how we use your information, contact our [Customer Services](https://n.vodafone.ie/support.html) team or email us at [dataprotection.ie@vodafone.com](mailto:dataprotection.ie@vodafone.com).

### Vodafone products

There are a range of Vodafone apps. This Privacy Statement also applies to those apps, but there will also be an additional Privacy Supplement provided with the app itself with more specific information. In those cases, both will apply.

When you download or use a Vodafone app, information may be accessed from or stored on your device. This will let it operate and function as well as remember you.

To provide you with the service, communicate with you and to work to improve our services, we’ll need to collect information about your device (for example, type, unique identifiers, its operating system, if you’re using 3G or 4G, etc.), app ID and information about your use of the app. Additional information also may be collected to provide you with the requested service.

Each app will set out the preferences it requires to operate, some of which you may be able to opt out of in some cases.

Opting out of certain preferences may, however, affect the functionality of certain services and apps. For example, if you opt out of the location-based feature on your device, you may find that an app doesn’t operate.

It’s important to flag that, where you choose to download or use an app not operated by Vodafone, those apps are subject to their own terms of use and privacy and cookies policies. Make sure you’re familiar with those before downloading or using that app. We can’t be responsible for the security and content of such third-party apps.

### My Vodafone app

MyVodafone application is a self-service app that helps you stay on top of your plan or prepaid account. You can view and pay bills, recharge your prepaid service, check your usage and update your account settings. To provide you with features of MyVodafone, to send you personalized recommendations as well as to help improve our products and services MyVodafone will share certain information from your device with us.

This privacy supplement defines how your information is used by the MyVodafone application. Please read [Vodafone’s full privacy policy](https://n.vodafone.ie/privacy).

What information we collect

When you use the basic features of MyVodafone, for example, check your billing details, view your data plans, view information about how much data a particular app is consuming, or interact with our customer care, information about such interactions is recorded on our servers.

MyVodafone app collects the following information:

App Usage

Information about the performance and use of the MyVodafone app, for example, when and how many times the app has been used, your choices and journeys within the app, app version, last update and application ID.

Information about the quality and use of your connectivity services and apps

Unless you have disabled the collection through the app settings, MyVodafone will regularly send us information about the coverage, connectivity and data usage relating to your connectivity services, information about the applications on your device, your location as well as information about your device, as explained in more detail below.

Coverage, connectivity and data usage

Information about network connectivity and quality for phone calls, internet and data services as experienced by you, as well as statistics about how much your device uses internet services and consumes data, such as:

* the percentage of time your phone is on the network
    
* signal strength
    
* areas of limited or no service
    
* quality of the mobile overage (2G, 3G, 4G)
    
* call duration
    
* how the call ends
    
* regular tests of whether your device can connect to the internet
    
* your upload and download speed
    
* how long it takes to set up a connection to the internet
    
* WiFi connection quality and MAC addresses of the Wi-Fi hot spots your device can see, and how congested they are
    
* hourly data use
    
* how much data your phone uses when its in standby mode
    
* how much data goes over Wi-Fi connections vs. the mobile network
    

Applications

Statistics about applications on your devices, such as:

* which apps are installed on your device
    
* which apps are started each day and for how long each app is used
    
* how much data is consumed by each app, how fast each app receives and transmits data and the type and quality of network used for the connection (for example cellular or WiFi and related signal strength)
    

Device Information

Technical information about your device, such as:

* phone brand and model
    
* operating system
    
* firmware version
    
* hardware capabilities
    
* language and locale
    
* battery state
    
* memory consumption
    
* time since last reboot
    

What we do with this information

We analyse the collected information to diagnose connectivity, coverage or connection quality problems, understand connectivity needs from the usage of mobile data, WiFi and apps, and use such insights to make improvements to our network and services. This may include, for example

* Improving the quality of network through e.g. better understanding about the exact areas with low network performance or areas of high consumption of data which helps us prioritise new site implementation and otherwise improve the network performance;
    
* Helping us deal with performance issues caused by poorly performing devices;
    
* Improving our commercial models and offers based on improved understanding the patterns related to the use of apps and connection quality;
    
* Improving the performance and design of MyVodafone by understanding which features of the app are popular and how those features perform on different types of devices.
    

Providing you with personalized assistance and recommendations

We may use the collected information to help us provide more personalized marketing communications to you. We may, for example

* Recommend a new or a different bundle for you based on the way you use your connectivity services;
    
* Help you manage your data plans by showing you which apps consume more data;
    
* Recommend upgrades to your device or promote accessories.
    

We may combine the collected information with other information we may hold of you.

If you have chosen to provide us with information without being personally identified, all personal identifiers are removed in the app before sending such information to Vodafone and we process the collected information anonymously. We do not intend to use the information to identify you or any other person personally and we have in place appropriate technical and organizational measures to prevent such from happening.

Location data

Unless you have disabled the collection through the app settings, we collect your location data when we measure the items above. For example, we know your rough location from the phone mast and Wi-Fi hot spot your phone is using. When your phone or one of your apps is using GPS location data, we use that to assess location more precisely and sometimes your speed and direction of travel if available with GPS information.

Unless you have chosen otherwise, this information is collected with a personal identifier.

What information we don’t collect

We understand that some of the information we collect may be seen as sensitive. Therefore we have designed the app to reduce the sensitivity of the collected information. For example, we don’t collect information about:

* any content of your communications, such as sms, email or chat content or your browsing history;
    
* information about which features of the apps you use or what content you send, receive or otherwise consume through an app.
    

How long do we keep the information for?

Detailed information about the quality and use of your connectivity services, location and apps is kept no longer than 14 months after it has been collected.

Vodafone may retain aggregated and statistical reports that have been generated using the listed information for a longer period, but as these reports do not identify you as a user, they will not be used in a way that impacts your privacy.

What do we do with the information?

In addition to using the data to the extent necessary to deliver you with the services that you have requested, for example to show you how much data an app consumes, we use the data to help us improve our networks and services as well as to make personalized recommendations to you.

Your choices

Vodafone offers you choices and control over what information you are willing to share from your device. You may choose to:

* Disable the sending of personal information about the quality and use of your connectivity services, location and apps;
    
* Disable the sending of any information about the quality and use of your connectivity services, location and apps;
    
* Disable the sending of information about your use of MyVodafone;
    
* Disable push-notifications.
    

NOTE:

if you disable push-notifications, we may still send you marketing SMS or email, or conduct telemarketing if we have your permission to do so. You can get in touch with customer services through the ‘Contact Us’ page on our site to opt out of all marketing communications or to opt out of marketing in one of several ways (such as email, text, phone or post).

Remember that turning off these preferences will impact the level of personalisation we will be able to offer you.

Information security

Vodafone takes technical and organisational security measures as required by law and by industry standards to protect your personal data from unauthorised access, use or disclosure. We take steps to ensure that we only use your personal information as described in this privacy notice and to honour the permission choices that you have made. We only partner with service providers who contract to provide the same level of information security that you can expect from Vodafone.

Who provides the service?

MyVodafone is provided solely by Vodafone Ireland Ltd, registered in Ireland at Mountain View, Leopardstown, Dublin 18, under registered number 326967.

### IOU app

### NetPerform app

This application collects information about the way your phone interacts with our network and services as described below. We hold this data securely and anonymously for 14 months, which lets us view and plan for seasonal variations of network use.

### Network coverage

This application will capture statistics about your connectivity for phone calls. This allows us to diagnose connectivity or connection quality problems and make improvements to our network in your area. We log:

* the percentage of time your phone is on the network.
    
* the cell ID and location of the phone masts used and how you move between them, when your phone is active.
    
* signal strength areas of limited or no service.
    
* quality of the coverage (2G, 3G, 4G).
    

### Internet connectivity

This application will capture statistics about your connectivity for internet or data coverage. This allows us to diagnose connectivity or connection quality problems. We log:

* every hour, a test of whether you can connect to the internet.
    
* your upload and download speed.  
    
* the cell ID and location of the phone masts used and how you move between them, when your phone is active.  
    
* areas of limited or no service.  
    
* quality of the coverage.  
    
* how long it takes to set up a connection to the internet.  
    
* Wi-Fi quality.
    
* MAC addresses of the Wi-Fi hot spots your device can see
    

### Call quality and usage

The success or failure of your calling experience can be diagnosed using technical details about the network, your coverage, or your phone’s signal quality during a call. This helps us improve all aspects of your calling experience. We log:

* the cell ID and location of phone masts serving your incoming and outgoing calls and other masts used if you change location during the call.
    
* signal strength.
    
* call duration.
    
* how the call ends.
    
* quality of the coverage.
    

### Data usage

So that we can diagnose the overall usage of the internet data use on different phone models we capture information about how much your device use internet services and consume data. This helps us improve device and network data efficiency for you and other customers based on real world data usage. We log:

* hourly data use.
    
* how much data your phone uses when in standby mode.
    
* how much data goes over Wi-Fi connections vs. the cellular network.
    

### Applications

So that we can identify trends in data usage that help us allocate capacity for data heavy applications in your area, we assess the data use of the applications on your phone. We log:

* what apps are installed on your phone.
    
* how long they are used.
    
* how much data and how fast each app receives and transmits.
    

### Location

When we measure the items above related to coverage and usage, we know your rough location from the phone mast Wi-Fi hot spot your phone is using. When your phone or one of your apps is using GPS location data, we use that to assess location more precisely and sometimes speed if available with GPS information. This enables us to identify areas of weak coverage and This information will be used to improve poor performance for you and fellow customers.

### Anonymisation of Information

The network and device improvements that this application is designed for do not require personal information. This means we do not log personal information, all network data is anonymised by the application before it is sent to Vodafone.

Personal information we collect about you

Information we collect about you

The types of information we process about you and any devices you register with the service when you use Secure Net and the accompanying App are:

* Your browsing activity on the network; Secure Net is a service that uses a process Domain Name System (DNS) Filtering on websites you are navigating to you in order to protect you from malicious sites and malware. This means for example, that if we know a certain website or app traffic has been blacklisted because it contains harmful content, we’ll warn you that you shouldn’t proceed to that site before you land on it. We do not use this information for other purposes;
    
* Your phone number, tariff information and price plan;
    
* Information about devices that are set up to be protected by Secure Net or to be subject to parental controls. For example, we collect information on the type of connected device that you are using (such as whether it’s a mobile device, a laptop, a gaming console or smart home devices, and their manufacturers) and its unique device identifier (for example, the IMEI number, the device’s mobile phone number, or the MAC address of the device’s wireless network interface);
    
* If you activate the Secure Net cleaning tool, we will access data from your device to help remove security threats from your device;
    
* The names or nicknames you add when creating family profiles;
    
* If you are adding children’s profiles, we’ll ask for their age range – this is so we can restrict age-inappropriate content; and
    
* Your credential information such as passwords, hints and similar security information used for authentication and access to accounts and services. This could be your Vodafone ID credentials if you set up your login via this method.
    

We’ll also get information about how you use our products and services, such as:

* Details of your use of our services – for example, we can see whether or not a site has been blocked and keep a limited record of this information for service and customer care (see How long we keep your personal information for), or how often you interact with our online portal or App dashboard to see summaries of your threat protection or parental controls, or the sorts of parental controls you are setting; and

Please note: If you disable push-notifications, we may still send you marketing via SMS or email, or conduct telemarketing if we have your permission to do so. You can get in touch with us to opt out of marketing communications (such as email, SMS, phone or post).

### How we use your personal information

To assist our customer care services

* We can advise you if you are having device performance or connectivity issues.
    

To improve our networks and services  
We analyse the collected information to diagnose connectivity, coverage or connection quality problems, understand connectivity needs from the usage of mobile data, Wi-Fi and apps, and use such insights to make improvements to our network and services. This may include, for example;

* Helping us deal with performance issues caused by poorly performing devices;
    
* Improving our commercial models and offers based on improved understanding the patterns related to the use of apps and connection quality;
    
* Improving the performance and design of the Gigabox app by understanding which features of the app are popular and how those features perform on different types of devices.
    

All personal identifiers are removed in the app before sending such information to Vodafone and we process the collected information anonymously. We do not intend to use the information to identify you or any other person personally and we have in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to prevent such from happening.

If you disable the sending of information about your use of the Gigabox App, we still collect a reduced set of anonymous information every time the app is used (goes in foreground/background):

* app version;
    
* app last update;
    
* application ID;
    
* device make and model;
    
* date and time the app went in foreground;
    
* date and time the app went in background;
    
* router model;
    
* router firmware version;
    
* Anonymized Line Id;
    
* Anonymized Router Serial Number
    
* Usage information collection (on/off)
    
* App crashes information
    

Marketing and profiling  
If we have your permission, we will use the collected information combined with other information we hold about you to help us provide more personalised marketing communications to you. We can, for example  
• Recommend a new or a different bundle for you based on the way you use your connectivity services;  
• Help you manage your data plans by showing you which apps consume more data; and  
• Recommend upgrades to your device or promote accessories.

###   
How we share your personal information

Where applicable, we share information about you with:

* Companies in the Vodafone Group;
    
* Partners, suppliers or agents involved in delivering the products and services you’ve ordered or used;
    
* Companies who are engaged to perform services for, or on behalf of, Vodafone Limited, or Vodafone Group;
    
* Third parties for personalised marketing purposes, where you have given us your permission to do so;
    
* Credit reference, fraud-prevention or business-scoring agencies, or other credit scoring agencies;
    
* Debt collection agencies or other debt-recovery organisations;
    
* Law enforcement agencies, government bodies, regulatory organisations, courts or other public authorities if we have to, or are authorised to by law; or
    
* A third party or body where such disclosure is required to satisfy any applicable law, or other legal or regulatory requirement.
    

### International data transfers

Occasionally we may need to transfer your data outside of the EEA, for example if we have a service provide that we have contracted on our behalf. When Vodafone sends your information to a country that is not in the EEA, we make sure that your information is properly protected. We will always ensure that there is a proper legal agreement that covers the data transfer. In addition, if the country is not considered to have laws that are equivalent to EU data protection standards then we will ask the third party to enter into a legal agreement that reflects those standards.

How long we keep your personal information for

Detailed information about the quality and use of your connectivity services and location is kept no longer than 13 months after it has been collected.

Vodafone may retain aggregated and statistical reports that have been generated using the listed information for a longer period, but as these reports do not identify you as a user, they will not be used in a way that impacts your privacy.

### Keeping your personal information secure

We have specialised security teams who constantly review and improve our measures to protect your personal information from unauthorised access, accidental loss, disclosure or destruction.

We cannot accept responsibility for any unauthorised access or loss of personal information that is beyond our control.

We’ll never ask for your secure personal or account information by an unsolicited means of communication. You’re responsible for keeping your personal and account information secure and not sharing it with others.

  

### Mobile

Every time you use your mobile phone, a record is kept. This includes the number you called or sent a text or picture message to, the length, date and time of a call, text or picture message and your approximate location at the time that the communication takes place (based on the location of the nearest cell that you sent that call or message from). The same is also recorded every time you receive an incoming call or message. We don’t, however, keep a record of the content of your calls or messages.

We’ll also keep a record of the data you use. This will record things like how much you spend in or out of bundle, or in an app, to enable us to charge you the right amount on your next bill as well as other things such as alerting you if you are close to your usage limit, fix faults and send you service messages. We don’t keep a record of the content of any messages you send using your data.

As part of providing the service, we need to understand and manage traffic flows on the network. So this also means we require information about your data usage. This includes capturing IP addresses and traffic data such as the websites you’ve visited. We’ll also have information about the Vodafone apps you use including location data. Having this information also means that we’re able to provide you with services that you request and work to improve them.

Capturing the websites you’ve visited doesn’t mean that we will have a history of your web-browsing as this is limited for a short real time period to enable the connection to be made. Details about websites visited may be stored for analytical purposes, such as counting the amount of times a specific web URL is visited, but this is only captured in a generic format and cannot be linked back to individual customers. For more information on your browsing history, see our [Cookies Policy](#cookies).

To help us provide you with services and work to improve them, we need to understand how you use your mobile. This means that we’ll have certain information about your device such as its make and model, the device ID, which operating system it uses, and if you’re using 3G or 4G.

It’s important to flag to you that third-party content providers like Spotify, and Sky Sports will have their own terms of use, and privacy and cookies policies that apply to you when you access their content on your mobile. Make sure you’re familiar with these and understand how they use your information before downloading or using their services.

### Phone

When you use your phone a record is kept of the call traffic details , which is the time and date of the call, the number called and the duration of the call. We do not record the content of the call.

### Home broadband

As part of providing this service, we need to understand and manage traffic flows on the network.

To do this, we need information about your broadband usage. This includes capturing IP addresses and traffic data such as the websites you’ve visited. We’ll also have information about the Vodafone apps that you use. Having this information means we’re able to provide you with services that you request and work to improve them.

Capturing the websites you’ve visited doesn’t mean that we will have a history of your web-browsing as this is limited for a short real time period to enable the connection to be made. Details about websites visited may be stored for analytical purposes, such as counting the amount of times a specific web URL is visited, but this is only captured in a generic format and cannot be linked back to individual customers. For more information on your browsing history, see the [cookies policy](#cookies).

For more information on using apps, see the app section above.

It’s important to flag that third-party content providers such as Spotify and Sky Sports will have their own terms of use and privacy and cookies policies that apply when you access their content using broadband. Make sure you’re informed on these and understand how your information is used before downloading or using their services.

### Vodafone TV

If you watch TV through the Vodafone TV app, please also read the Apps section on this page.

It’s important to flag that certain content providers may have their own terms of use and privacy and cookies policies that may apply to you when you access their content. Content providers include, for example, Netflix, iPlayer. You should check these on their websites to be sure you’re informed on and understand how your information is used.

Vodafone wants you to receive the most benefit from your TV service with us.

In order to be able to provide you with our TV service, and to continually improve it, we need to collect information about how you watch TV. We can do this using the Vodafone TV Box or the Vodafone TV app on your devices. For example, we’ll collect information about what you watch (which may include adverts), how long you watched it for and what you did such as pausing, recording, fast-forwarding, etc.

We’ll collect information about what you used to watch it (such as which Vodafone TV Box or which device) and where you watched it (location data, time zones, etc.). We’ll know what you downloaded or purchased. We’ll also know, for example, the IP addresses for any devices, device IDs and/or unique identifiers, your user IDs and passwords, any device parental control or purchase PIN codes. Your devices such as your Vodafone TV Box will tell us about your use of the services and third-party content, products and services.

We also use the information we collect to be able to charge you the right amount on your next bill (for example, where you have rented a film or have elected to charge Netflix to your Vodafone bill) as well as other things such as fix faults and send you service messages.

We’ll use the information to be able to provide you with localised content, to send you viewing recommendations and analyse what you watched so that we can enhance our services further.

We’ll also use the information to provide reports to third parties such as content providers and advertisers. These reports won’t contain information that may identify you.  

### General

We may use the information you provide us to contact you about offers and promotions including competitions, prize draws and surveys based on how you use our products and services.

We may also contact you to let you know about products and services of Vodafone, Vodafone Group companies and those of other companies which we think may interest you.

We may tailor or personalise the marketing message and its content based on the information you’ve provided to us and your use of Vodafone’s website, products and services.

We’ll assume that you’re comfortable to receive these messages unless you tell us otherwise. We’ll contact you by post, online, phone or push notifications through our apps.

For more information on online advertising, see the Advertising Online section below.

### Analytics

We use a variety of analytics methods, which involve mathematically driven analysis techniques where large and varied data sets uncover hidden patterns and previously unrevealed trends. At Vodafone we take governance of analytics seriously. Our data scientists are required to sign up to a Code of Ethics. We have a strict use case process that requires that privacy and data protection law checks are carried out before any use case commences. We have strict rules ensuring that personal information is anonymised at the appropriate stage in the process so that it is no longer possible to identify an individual.

### How to opt out

If you no longer want to receive marketing messages from Vodafone, you can elect to opt out of all marketing communications or only selected methods (email, text, phone or post).

There are various ways to opt out:

* Contact our customer services team – see the [contact us](https://n.vodafone.ie/support.html) page;
    
* Click the link at the end of a marketing email or text to unsubscribe;
    
* Disable push notification messages, including marketing messages, at any time in our apps by changing the notification settings on your device or by uninstalling the app;
    
* Email [dataprotection.ie@vodafone.com](mailto:dataprotection.ie@vodafone.com)
    
    for guidance.
    

Opting out does not mean that you won’t receive service-related messages anymore. You will still continue to receive those (unless we have indicated otherwise).

To opt out of receiving marketing communications from other Vodafone Group companies, just contact them directly.

In some cases, you may receive marketing from Vodafone, even if you’re not a customer or never had contact with Vodafone. This is a result of third-party marketing lists which Vodafone may acquire from time to time. If you’ve registered to opt out of such marketing, you shouldn’t receive such communications. If you do, we ask that you let us know immediately by contacting us on 1800200234 or (01)2527218.

### Advertising online

To deliver advertising that is relevant to you, you’ll also see targeted advertising online based on the use of cookies. This is known as interest-based advertising. We may also combine data collected via the cookies with other data we have collected.

You’ll also receive direct marketing based on use of cookies. If you don't want any information processed through the use of cookies, check our [cookies policy](#cookies). It explains how to control and opt out of cookies.

Remember that opting out of interest-based advertising won’t stop advertisements from being displayed – but they won’t be tailored to your interests.

* Your location data. This can be precise where it uses Global Positioning System (GPS) data or by identifying nearby mobile phone masts and Wi-Fi hotspots. Or less precise where, for example, a location is derived from your IP address or data such as a post code or name of a town or city.
    

We’ll also get information about how you use our products and services, such as:

* The level of service that you receive – for example, network or service faults and other events that may affect our network services or other services; and
    
* Details of your use of our services – for example, we can see the amount of data your devices are using which we can use to assess what sorts of data allowances we need to provide for different Connected Devices.
    

When we collect your personal information

We collect your personal information when:

* You use any of your Connected Devices;
    
* Device or app-generated data has been provided by our partners (see Third party sources of data);
    
* You subscribe to marketing; or
    
* You contact our customer care teams with a question or complaint.
    

Third party sources of data

Given that our customer care teams act of your one-stop-shop for queries and issues around your Connected Devices, we share limited personal data between Vodafone and the partners whose products you have purchased in order for us to achieve this. For example, we may need to share the fact that your device isn’t working or that we needed to reset it with the partner in question.

If you have given us your permission, we also receive your Connected Device’s Service Data from our partners in order to profile you and tailor our communications to you. For example, if we can see that you regularly use a product we might think you want to hear about our others. You can adjust your privacy preferences at any time; see Marketing and profiling for more details.

Where necessary, we collect information from certain organisations. These include fraud-prevention agencies, business directories and credit reference agencies.

Vodafone will process your personal data based on:

1\. The performance of your contract or to enter into the contract and to take action on your requests. For example, we’ll need to process your network traffic data as part of making your devices “connected” and we’ll need to process your payment details for your monthly billing.

2\. Vodafone’s legitimate business interests, for example, fraud prevention, maintaining the security of our network and services, direct marketing, and improvement of our services. Whenever we rely on this lawful basis to process your data, we assess our business interests to make sure they do not override your rights. Additionally, in some cases you have the right to object to this processing. For more information, visit the Your Rights section of this policy.

3\. Compliance with a mandatory legal obligation, including for example accounting and tax requirements, which are subject to strict internal policies (such as retention periods), procedures, and your right to restrict usage of your data, which control the scope of legal assistance to be provided; or

4\. Consent you provide where Vodafone does not rely on another legal basis. Consent is always presented to you separately and you can withdraw your consent at any time.

### How we use your personal information

1\. To provide you with your service

We use your information for service provision and to fulfil any purchases you have made:

* to help us identify you and any accounts you hold with us;
    
* to provide you with the connectivity you have requested for your Connected Devices;
    
* billing and customer care; and
    
* identity verification.
    

2\. Marketing & profiling

If you are opted into marketing and have given us permission to use your data to tailor these communications, we’ll use your purchasing preferences and data from your Connected Devices to inform the sorts of marketing we should be sending you so that it’s the most relevant for you. For example, if we can see that you have purchased V-Pet, we can make sure we don’t market that product to you.

To opt out of Marketing messages or profiling:

If you no longer want to receive marketing messages from Vodafone, you can elect to opt out of all marketing communications or only selected methods (email, messaging, phone or post).

There are various ways to opt out:

* If you are a Vodafone consumer mobile customer, you can log in to your My Vodafone account, access ‘settings’ on the My Vodafone App, or call 1800 200 234 to manage your marketing permissions and to opt out or into receiving personalised marketing.
    
* For customers without a Vodafone mobile number, you can manage your permissions in the V by Vodafone App.
    
* Contact our customer services team via v.vodafone.com;
    
* All our marketing messages come with an “unsubscribe” link which you can click to unsubscribe;
    
* Tell the adviser if you receive an outbound marketing call;
    
* Email dataprotection.ie@vodafone.com for guidance.
    

Opting out does not mean that you won’t any longer receive service-related messages, such as messages telling you about your order status or when our Terms & Conditions change. You will still continue to receive those (unless we have indicated otherwise).

3\. Other profiling and automated processing

Outside of the profiling we conduct for marketing purposes to tailor and personalise the communications we send, we also profile you for credit, fraud and security purposes.

This can sometimes use systems to make automated decisions based on personal information we have or are allowed to collect from others. The goal is to make the decisions as quick, efficient, fair and correct as possible, based on what we know. It can affect the products or services we may offer you now or in the future.

We will process your personal data in order to protect against and detect fraud, and to recover debts or trace those who owe us money resulting from the use of our services.

4\. Service improvement

* We collect anonymous, de-identified or aggregate information in order to improve the service we offer to everyone. None of these analytics are linked back to you in any way.
    
* To protect our networks and manage the volumes of calls, texts and other uses of our networks. For example, we identify peak periods of use so we can try and ensure the networks can handle the volume at those times; and
    
* To understand how you use our networks, products and services. That way we can seek to review, develop and improve these, develop more interesting and relevant products and services, as well as personalising our products and services.
    

### How we share your personal information

Where applicable, we share information about you with:

* Companies in the Vodafone Group;
    
* Partners, suppliers or agents involved in delivering the products and services you’ve ordered or used;
    
* Companies who are engaged to perform services for, or on behalf of, Vodafone Limited, or Vodafone Group;
    
* Credit reference, fraud-prevention or business-scoring agencies, or other credit scoring agencies;
    
* Debt collection agencies or other debt-recovery organisations;
    
* Law enforcement agencies, government bodies, regulatory organisations, courts or other public authorities if we have to, or are authorised to by law; or
    
* A third party or body where such disclosure is required to satisfy any applicable law, or other legal or regulatory requirement.
    

We also share aggregate performance information with third party V by Vodafone partners to understand how products and the V by Vodafone offering is performing commercially. For example, if we know that certain products are selling well, we can focus on partnering with more partners that cater to the market. This information does not identify you personally.

### International data transfers

If you are a non-Vodafone consumer mobile customer and we need to verify your identity, we will need to transfer your data to our service provider, which is based in India. Additionally our customer care centres are run by Vodafone Shared Services which is based in Hungary, Egypt, India and Romania.

When Vodafone sends your information to a country that is not in the EEA, we make sure that your information is properly protected. We will always ensure that there is a proper legal agreement that covers the data transfer. In addition, if the country is not considered to have laws that are equivalent to EU data protection standards then we will ask the third party to enter into a legal agreement that reflects those standards.

### How long we keep your personal information

We’ll store and process your information for as long as we have to by law or as long as we need to be able to deliver you the services you have requested. We’ll keep some personal information for a reasonable period after your contract with us has finished in case you decide to use our services again. We, or one of our partners, may contact you about Vodafone services during this time if you haven’t opted out of receiving marketing communications from us. Once these bases have expired, we’ll delete that information.

### Keeping your personal information secure

We have specialised security teams who constantly review and improve our measures to protect your personal information from unauthorised access, accidental loss, disclosure or destruction.

Communications over the internet (such as emails) aren’t secure unless they’ve been encrypted. Your communications may go through a number of countries before being delivered, as this is the nature of the internet.  

We cannot accept responsibility for any unauthorised access or loss of personal information that is beyond our control.  

We’ll never ask for your secure personal or account information by an unsolicited means of communication. You’re responsible for keeping your personal and account information secure and not sharing it with others.  

Our website may provide links to third-party websites. We cannot be responsible for the security and content of such third-party websites. So make sure you read that company’s privacy and cookies policies before using or putting your personal information on their site.  

The same applies to any third-party websites or content you connect to using our products and services.  

You may choose to disclose your information in certain ways such as social plug-ins (including those offered by Google, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest) or using third-party services that allow you to post reviews or other information publicly, and a third party could use that information.  

Social plug-ins and social applications are operated by the social network themselves and are subject to their own terms of use and privacy and cookies policies. You should make sure you’re familiar with these.

Personal information we collect about you

Information we collect about you

The types of information we process about you when you use your Connected Devices are:

* Information about the V-Sim connectivity we provide for Connected Devices, such as the data connections performed and the amount of data consumed;
    
* Your location data. This can be precise where it uses Global Positioning System (GPS) data or by identifying nearby mobile phone masts and Wi-Fi hotspots. Or less precise where, for example, a location is derived from your IP address or data such as a post code or name of a town or city.
    

We’ll also get information about how you use our products and services, such as:

* The level of service that you receive – for example, network or service faults and other events that may affect our network services or other services; and
    
* Details of your use of our services – for example, we can see the amount of data your devices are using which we can use to assess what sorts of data allowances we need to provide for different Connected Devices.

You can adjust your privacy preferences at any time; see Marketing and profiling for more details.

Where necessary, we collect information from certain organisations. These include fraud-prevention agencies, business directories and credit reference agencies.

Vodafone will process your personal data based on:

1\. The performance of your contract or to enter into the contract and to take action on your requests. For example, we’ll need to process your network traffic data as part of making your devices “connected” and we’ll need to process your payment details for your monthly billing.

2\. Vodafone’s legitimate business interests, for example, fraud prevention, maintaining the security of our network and services, direct marketing, and improvement of our services. Whenever we rely on this lawful basis to process your data, we assess our business interests to make sure they do not override your rights. Additionally, in some cases, you have the right to object to this processing. For more information, visit the Your Rights section of this policy.

3\. Compliance with a mandatory legal obligation, including for example accounting and tax requirements, which are subject to strict internal policies (such as retention periods), procedures, and your right to restrict usage of your data, which control the scope of legal assistance to be provided; or

4\. Consent you provide where Vodafone does not rely on another legal basis. Consent is always presented to you separately and you can withdraw your consent at any time.

How we use your personal information

1\. To provide you with your service

We use your information for service provision and to fulfil any purchases you have made:

* to help us identify you and any accounts you hold with us;
    
* to provide you with the connectivity you have requested for your Connected Devices;
    
* billing and customer care; and
    
* identity verification.
    

2\. Marketing & profiling

If you are opted into marketing and have given us permission to use your data to tailor these communications, we’ll use your purchasing preferences and data from your Connected Devices to inform the sorts of marketing we should be sending you so that it’s the most relevant for you. For example, if we can see that you have purchased V-Pet, we can make sure we don’t market that product to you.

To opt out of Marketing messages or profiling:

If you no longer want to receive marketing messages from Vodafone, you can elect to opt out of all marketing communications or only selected methods (email, messaging, phone or post).

There are various ways to opt out:

* If you are a Vodafone consumer mobile customer, you can log in to your My Vodafone account, access ‘settings’ on the My Vodafone App, or call 1800 200 234 to manage your marketing permissions and to opt out or into receiving personalised marketing.
    
* For customers without a Vodafone mobile number, you can manage your permissions in the V by Vodafone App.
    
* Contact our customer services team via v.vodafone.com;
    
* All our marketing messages come with an “unsubscribe” link which you can click to unsubscribe;
    
* Tell the adviser if you receive an outbound marketing call;
    
* Email dataprotection.ie@vodafone.com for guidance.
    

Opting out does not mean that you won’t any longer receive service-related messages, such as messages telling you about your order status or when our Terms & Conditions change. You will still continue to receive those (unless we have indicated otherwise).

3\. Other profiling and automated processing

Outside of the profiling we conduct for marketing purposes to tailor and personalise the communications we send, we also profile you for credit, fraud and security purposes.

This can sometimes use systems to make automated decisions based on personal information we have or are allowed to collect from others. The goal is to make the decisions as quick, efficient, fair and correct as possible, based on what we know. It can affect the products or services we may offer you now or in the future.

We will process your personal data in order to protect against and detect fraud, and to recover debts or trace those who owe us money resulting from the use of our services.

4\. Service improvement

* We collect anonymous, de-identified or aggregate information in order to improve the service we offer to everyone. None of these analytics are linked back to you in any way.
    
* To protect our networks and manage the volumes of calls, texts and other uses of our networks. For example, we identify peak periods of use so we can try and ensure the networks can handle the volume at those times; and
    
* To understand how you use our networks, products and services. That way we can seek to review, develop and improve these, develop more interesting and relevant products and services, as well as personalising our products and services.
    

How we share your personal information

Where applicable, we share information about you with:

* Companies in the Vodafone Group;
    
* Partners, suppliers or agents involved in delivering the products and services you’ve ordered or used;
    
* Companies who are engaged to perform services for, or on behalf of, Vodafone Limited, or Vodafone Group;
    
* Credit reference, fraud-prevention or business-scoring agencies, or other credit scoring agencies;
    
* Debt collection agencies or other debt-recovery organisations;
    
* Law enforcement agencies, government bodies, regulatory organisations, courts or other public authorities if we have to, or are authorised to by law; or
    
* A third party or body where such disclosure is required to satisfy any applicable law, or other legal or regulatory requirement.
    

We also share aggregate performance information with third party V by Vodafone partners to understand how products and the V by Vodafone offering is performing commercially. For example, if we know that certain products are selling well, we can focus on partnering with more partners that cater to the market. This information does not identify you personally.

\[ACCORDION\] International data transfers

If you are a non-Vodafone consumer mobile customer and we need to verify your identity, we will need to transfer your data to our service provider, which is based in India. Additionally our customer care centres are run by Vodafone Shared Services which is based in Hungary, Egypt, India and Romania.

When Vodafone sends your information to a country that is not in the EEA, we make sure that your information is properly protected. We will always ensure that there is a proper legal agreement that covers the data transfer. In addition, if the country is not considered to have laws that are equivalent to EU data protection standards then we will ask the third party to enter into a legal agreement that reflects those standards.

How long we keep your personal information for

We’ll store and process your information for as long as we have to by law or as long as we need to be able to deliver you the services you have requested. We’ll keep some personal information for a reasonable period after your contract with us has finished in case you decide to use our services again. We, or one of our partners, may contact you about Vodafone services during this time if you haven’t opted out of receiving marketing communications from us. Once these bases have expired, we’ll delete that information.

Keeping your personal information secure

We have specialised security teams who constantly review and improve our measures to protect your personal information from unauthorised access, accidental loss, disclosure or destruction.

Communications over the internet (such as emails) aren’t secure unless they’ve been encrypted. Your communications may go through a number of countries before being delivered, as this is the nature of the internet.

We cannot accept responsibility for any unauthorised access or loss of personal information that is beyond our control.

We’ll never ask for your secure personal or account information by an unsolicited means of communication. You’re responsible for keeping your personal and account information secure and not sharing it with others.

Our website may provide links to third-party websites. We cannot be responsible for the security and content of such third-party websites. So make sure you read that company’s privacy and cookies policies before using or putting your personal information on their site.

The same applies to any third-party websites or content you connect to using our products and services.

You may choose to disclose your information in certain ways such as social plug-ins (including those offered by Google, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest) or using third-party services that allow you to post reviews or other information publicly, and a third party could use that information.

Social plug-ins and social applications are operated by the social network themselves and are subject to their own terms of use and privacy and cookies policies. You should make sure you’re familiar with these.

We sometimes supplement the information we collect about you with information from other sources (such as the electoral roll). This will be prompted to you on first registration of a connected device within the V by Vodafone or V Auto apps. We also use this verification for access to your account and for general account management. However, this identity verification process is supported by human agents that will verify the output of the automated decision.
    
* We will process your personal data in order to protect against and detect fraud, and to recover debts or trace those who owe us money resulting from the use of our services.

* You buy a connected product from us (online, or in store);
    
* You first register your Connected Device product in the V-Auto App;
    
* If you’re a non-Vodafone customer, when we verify your identity and you add your payment details;
    
* You use the V-Auto Application and any of its features (such as Find my Car, Auto SOS, My Trips, and Driver Safety Score);
    
* You activate and drive with the V-Auto device installed in your vehicle;
    
* Where a user has nominated you as an additional user to the V-auto product;
    
* You subscribe to marketing; or
    
* You contact our customer care teams with a question or complaint.
    

Third party sources of data

Where necessary, we collect information from certain organisations. These include fraud-prevention agencies, business directories and credit reference agencies.

Where we have partnered with any third parties for promotions or offers you have participated in, we will share aggregate information between us and these parties to measure the success of the initiative.

Vodafone will process your personal data based on:

1\. The performance of your contract or to enter into the contract and to take action on your requests. For example, we’ll need to process your network traffic data as part of making your V-Auto device “connected” and we’ll need to process your payment details for your monthly billing.

2\. Vodafone’s legitimate business interests, for example, fraud prevention, maintaining the security of our network and services, direct marketing, and improvement of our services. Whenever we rely on this lawful basis to process your data, we assess our business interests to make sure they do not override your rights. Additionally, in some cases, you have the right to object to this processing. For more information, visit the Your Rights section of this policy.

3\. Compliance with a mandatory legal obligation, including for example accounting and tax requirements, which are subject to strict internal policies (such as retention periods), procedures, and your right to restrict usage of your data, which control the scope of legal assistance to be provided; or

4\. Consent you provide where Vodafone does not rely on another legal basis. Consent is always presented to you separately and you can withdraw your consent at any time.

How we use your personal information

1\. To provide you with your service

We use your information for service provision and to fulfil any purchases you have made:

* to help us identify you and any accounts you hold with us;
    
* to provide you with connectivity for your V-Auto device and its functionalities such as Find my Car, Auto SOS, My Trips, and Driver Safety Score;
    
* billing and customer care;
    
* to notify you of any changes to the App or to our services that may affect you; and
    
* identity verification.
    

2\. Marketing & profiling

If you are opted into marketing and have given us permission to use your data to tailor these communications, we’ll use your interactions with this App and the data from your V-Auto device to inform the sorts of marketing we should be sending you so that it’s the most relevant for you. For example, if we can see that you have purchased V-Pet, we can make sure we don’t market that product to you.

To opt out of Marketing messages or profiling:

If you no longer want to receive marketing messages from Vodafone, you can elect to opt out of all marketing communications or only selected methods (email, messaging, phone or post).

There are various ways to opt out:

* If you are a Vodafone consumer mobile customer, you can log in to your MyVodafone account to manage your marketing permissions and to opt out or into receiving personalised marketing. For customers without a Vodafone mobile number, you can manage your permissions in the V-Auto App.
    
* Contact our customer care team via v.vodafone.com;
    
* All our marketing messages come with an “unsubscribe” link which you can click to unsubscribe;
    
* Tell the adviser if you receive an outbound marketing call;
    
* Email \[data.protection.ie@vodafone.com\] for guidance.
    

Opting out does not mean that you won’t any longer receive service-related messages, such as messages telling you about your order status or when our Terms & Conditions change. You will still continue to receive those (unless we have indicated otherwise).

3\. Other profiling and automated processing

Outside of the profiling we conduct for marketing purposes to tailor and personalise the communications we send, we use automated processing to generate the insights behind the key functionalities of the App. For example, we:

* create a driving score for you. This is based on a number of data inputs such as your acceleration, speed and deceleration; and
    
* provide you contextual information. For example, in the status screen you’ll get offered to set a parking alert if we detect that your car is moving or you’ll get offered directions to your car if we detect from your phone location that you are nearby it.
    

We also profile you for credit, fraud and security purposes. This can sometimes use systems to make automated decisions based on personal information we have or are allowed to collect from others. The goal is to make the decisions as quick, efficient, fair and correct as possible, based on what we know. It can affect the products or services we may offer you now or in the future.

* We will carry out a credit check when you apply for a contract for your products and services with us, as described in our privacy [policy](https://n.vodafone.ie/privacy).
    
* If you are not already a Vodafone customer, we will use your personal information for identity verification purposes. We sometimes supplement the information we collect about you with information from other sources (such as the electoral roll) This will be prompted to you on first registration of a connected device within the V by Vodafone or V Auto apps. We also use this verification for access to your account and for general account management. However, this identity verification process is supported by human agents that will verify the output of the automated decision.
    
* We will process your personal data in order to protect against and detect fraud, and to recover debts or trace those who owe us money resulting from the use of our services.
    

4\. Service improvement

* We collect anonymous, de-identified or aggregate information in order to improve the service we offer to everyone. None of these analytics are linked back to you in any way.
    
* To protect our networks and manage the volumes of calls, texts and other uses of our networks. For example, we identify peak periods of use so we can try and ensure the networks can handle the volume at those times; and
    
* To understand how you use our networks, products and services. That way we can seek to review, develop and improve these, develop more interesting and relevant products and services, as well as personalising our products and services.
    

How we share your personal information

Some features of your V-Auto device require us to share information with third parties, but we’ll ask you before we do, as these are optional. For example, when our agents ring you when Auto SOS has detected a collision, we ask you whether you need us to send help to the car’s location. Additionally, when we partner with third parties that can offer you services based on data such as your location, your driving score, or whether you’ve been in an accident we make sure no data is shared unless you actively request us to do so.

Where applicable, we share information about you with:

* Companies in the Vodafone Group;
    
* Partners, suppliers or agents involved in delivering the products and services you’ve ordered or used;
    
* Companies who are engaged to perform services for, or on behalf of, Vodafone Limited, or Vodafone Group;
    
* Credit reference, fraud-prevention or business-scoring agencies, or other credit scoring agencies;
    
* Debt collection agencies or other debt-recovery organisations;
    
* Third parties who you have nominated to view your driver information via the app;
    
* Law enforcement agencies, government bodies, regulatory organisations, courts or other public authorities if we have to, or are authorised to by law; or
    
* A third party or body where such disclosure is required to satisfy any applicable law, or other legal or regulatory requirement.
    

International data transfers

If you are a non-Vodafone customer and we need to verify your identity, we will need to transfer your data to our service provider, which is based in India.

When Vodafone sends your information to a country that is not in the EEA, we make sure that your information is properly protected. We will always ensure that there is a proper legal agreement that covers the data transfer. In addition, if the country is not considered to have laws that are equivalent to EU data protection standards then we will ask the third party to enter into a legal agreement that reflects those standards.

How long we keep your personal information for

We’ll store and process your information for as long as we have to by law or as long as we need to be able to deliver you the services you have requested. We’ll keep some personal information for a reasonable period after your contract with us has finished in case you decide to use our services again. We, or one of our partners, may contact you about Vodafone services during this time if you haven’t opted out of receiving marketing communications from us. Once these bases have expired, we’ll delete that information.

Keeping your personal information secure

We have specialised security teams who constantly review and improve our measures to protect your personal information from unauthorised access, accidental loss, disclosure or destruction.

Communications over the internet (such as emails) aren’t secure unless they’ve been encrypted. Your communications may go through a number of countries before being delivered, as this is the nature of the internet.

3\. Functionality – these help to enhance your experience by doing things like remembering products you've added to your basket

4\. Targeting/advertising – these are used to share some information with third parties who we advertise with, so we know how you've reached our website. We can also use cookies to identify the parts of the website you’re interested in. We then use this information to show you adverts and pages we think may also be of interest to you, to tailor how we communicate with you, or to tailor the contents of the communications we send to you. If you prefer, you can opt out of these.

* Your Connected Device location data. This can be precise where it uses Global Positioning System (GPS) data or by identifying nearby mobile phone masts and Wi-Fi hotspots and you enable location-based services or features. Or less precise where, for example, a location is derived from your IP address or data such as a post code or name of a town or city.
    
* We’ll also get information about how you use our products and services, such as:
    
* The level of service that you receive – for example, network or service faults and other events that may affect our network services or other services;
    
* Details of your use of our services – for example, we can see the amount of data the Connected Device is using which we can use to assess whether our data allowances are sufficient; and
    
* We also collect anonymous analytics information on how users use the Connected Device in order to improve your experience and troubleshoot.
    

When we collect your personal information

We collect personal information when:

* You first set up your Connected Device product in the App and add your contact details and those of contacts;
    
* You use the App and any of its features (for example, dismissing alerts or messaging other contacts);
    
* You subscribe to marketing; or
    
* You contact our customer care teams with a query.
    

Vodafone will process your personal data based on:

1\. The performance of your contract or to enter into the contract and to take action on your requests. For example, we’ll need to process your network traffic data as part of making your device “connected” and we’ll need to process Administrator's payment details for your monthly billing.

2\. Vodafone’s legitimate business interests, for example, fraud prevention, maintaining the security of our network and services, direct marketing, and improvement of our services. Whenever we rely on this lawful basis to process your data, we assess our business interests to make sure they do not override your rights. Additionally, in some cases you have the right to object to this processing. For more information, visit the Your Rights section of this policy.

3\. Compliance with a mandatory legal obligation, including for example accounting and tax requirements, which are subject to strict internal policies (such as retention periods), procedures, and your right to restrict usage of your data, which control the scope of legal assistance to be provided; or

4\. Consent you provide where Vodafone does not rely on another legal basis. Consent is always presented to you separately and you can withdraw your consent at any time.

How we use your personal information

1\. To provide you with your service

We use your information for service provision and to fulfil any purchases you have made:

* to help us identify you and any accounts you hold with us;
    
* to provide you with connectivity for your Connected Device;
    
* billing and customer care;
    
* to notify you of any changes to the App or to our services that may affect you; and
    
* identity verification.
    

1\. Marketing and profiling

If your Vodafone account is opted into marketing and you have given us permission to use your data to tailor these communications, we’ll use your interactions with this App and the data from your Connected Device to inform the sorts of marketing we should be sending you so that it’s the most relevant for you. For example, we can see whether you are getting the most out of your purchase or which Products you already have.

To opt out of Marketing messages or profiling:

If you no longer want to receive marketing messages from Vodafone, you can elect to opt out of all marketing communications or only selected methods (email, messaging, phone or post).

There are various ways to opt out:

* Contact our customer care team on 1907
    
* Log onto My Vodafone though the Vodafone website or via My Vodafone app to review and change your marketing preferences
    
* Tell the adviser you no longer want to be marketed to, if you receive an outbound marketing call;
    
* Email dataprotection.ie@vodafone.com for guidance.
    
* Opting out does not mean that you won’t any longer receive service-related messages, such as messages telling you about your order status or when our Terms and Conditions change. You will still continue to receive those (unless we have indicated otherwise). You may also receive marketing via push notifications if you have not turned them off via your App settings.
    

2\. Service improvement

We collect anonymous, de-identified or aggregate information in order to improve the service we offer to everyone. None of these analytics are linked back to you in any way.

To protect our networks and manage the volumes of calls, texts and other uses of our networks. For example, we identify peak periods of use so we can try and ensure the networks can handle the volume at those times; and

To understand how you use our networks, products and services. That way we can seek to review, develop and improve these, develop more interesting and relevant products and services, as well as personalising our products and services.

How we share your personal information

Where applicable, we share information about you with:

* Companies in the Vodafone Group;
    
* Partners, suppliers or agents involved in delivering the products and services you’ve ordered or used;

International data transfers

Our customer care centres are run by Vodafone Shared Services which is based in Hungary, Egypt, India and Romania.

Our processor [Smartcomm](https://www.smartcommunications.com/external-privacy-policy/), who provide the platform and will access the data in case there are any troubleshooting queries, will store your data in the EEA

The data accessed will only include support ticket data needed to resolve your issues. For example, your phone number or issues with the device.

If you are a non-Vodafone customer and we need to verify your identity, we will need to transfer your data to our service provider, which is based in India.

When Vodafone sends your information to a country that is not in the EEA, we make sure that your information is properly protected. We will always ensure that there is a proper legal agreement that covers the data transfer. In addition, if the country is not considered to have laws that are equivalent to EU data protection standards then we will ask the third party to enter into a legal agreement that reflects those standards.

How long we keep your personal information for

We’ll store and process your information for as long as we have to by law or as long as we need to be able to deliver you the services you have requested. We’ll keep some personal information for a reasonable period after your contract with us has finished in case you decide to use our services again. We, or one of our partners, may contact you about Vodafone services during this time if you haven’t opted out of receiving marketing communications from us. Once these bases have expired, we’ll delete that information.

Keeping your personal information secure

We have specialised security teams who constantly review and improve our measures to protect your personal information from unauthorised access, accidental loss, disclosure or destruction.

Communications over the internet (such as emails) aren’t secure unless they’ve been encrypted. Your communications may go through a number of countries before being delivered, as this is the nature of the internet.

We cannot accept responsibility for any unauthorised access or loss of personal information that is beyond our control.

We’ll never ask for your secure personal or account information by an unsolicited means of communication. You’re responsible for keeping your personal and account information secure and not sharing it with others.

Our website may provide links to third-party websites. We cannot be responsible for the security and content of such third-party websites. So make sure you read that company’s privacy and cookies policies before using or putting your personal information on their site.

The same applies to any third-party websites or content you connect to using our products and services.

You may choose to disclose your information in certain ways such as social plug-ins (including those offered by Google, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest) or using third-party services that allow you to post reviews or other information publicly, and a third party could use that information.

Social plug-ins and social applications are operated by the social network themselves and are subject to their own terms of use and privacy and cookies policies. You should make sure you’re familiar with these.

Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

### Why do I need to answer personal questions every time I call Vodafone?

Each time you contact Vodafone you may be asked a number of security questions to confirm your identity.

This practice works in the interest of your security, ensuring that another person cannot gain access to your account and make changes without your permission.

It is also helpful to our customer service representatives in checking that the account details are accurate and up to date.

### Does Vodafone share my personal data with other companies?

Yes, Vodafone will share your personal data with a number of third party companies who are acting on our behalf to provide a service to you (for example, if you order a new phone, your order will be dispatched to you by our order fulfilment partner).

Vodafone will ensure that the appropriate contractual and security arrangements are in place.

### Do I need to give consent for my phone call to be recorded?

Vodafone record some calls for quality and training purposes, ensuring that we are able to train our staff to handle your queries and offer a best in class service. You will be notified each time you are in contact with us that the call may be recorded for this purpose.

We do not ask for your consent as we have a legitimate business interest in recording calls for quality and training purposes. If you are not happy with a call being recorded, you can end the call at any time. Please note that all recorded calls are deleted within 90 days.

### Can I record my phone call to Vodafone?

By recording your phone call with Vodafone, you will be collecting the personal data of the employee that you are speaking to and will need to notify them that the call is being recorded.

The employee will have the right (as an individual) to object to your recording of the phone call and may choose not to continue with the call.

### Some of Vodafone’s call centres are outside of the EU. Is this legal and is my personal data protected?

Vodafone Ireland is part of the Vodafone Group and we use some services provided to us by other Vodafone companies for performing certain tasks (for example, customer care, administrative functions, and roaming services).

As a result, other Vodafone companies will have access to the personal data that is held by Vodafone Ireland to allow them to complete these tasks.

Vodafone Group ensures that all Vodafone companies maintain the same privacy commitment and that appropriate safeguards are in place. We also maintain intercompany agreements containing the appropriate EU contractual clauses to ensure that your data is protected.

### How do I give my permission to have my personal data shared with other companies?

Sometimes Vodafone will use a third party company to perform certain activities on our behalf.

If these activities are required in order to provide the service (example printing and posting your bill), then we have a legitimate business interest and do not require your permission.

If Vodafone is sharing personal data for any purpose where consent is required, we will ensure to respect your preferences.

### I am receiving unwanted communications from Vodafone about new products and services. How can I stop this?
