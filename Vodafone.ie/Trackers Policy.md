Local Storage

**What is Local Storage**

Local Storage is a type of web storage that allows JavaScript sites and apps to store and access data right in the browser with no expiration date. This means the data stored in the browser will persist even after the browser window has been closed.

**How We Use Local Storage**

We use local storage to keep track of which of our digital tools you have used and what you've done on the site. Local Storage also means you can use additional services such as live chat or allows us to survey customers regarding their experience. Some examples of local storage values are below.
