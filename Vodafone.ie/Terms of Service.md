**View My Bill**

The View My Bill service enables personal and certain business customers of Vodafone’s post paid mobile telecommunications service to view details of recent billing information. Only authorised personnel of business customers who have registered with Vodafone using the appropriate registration form can view the billing information of all the subscriber lines of that business customer. Any changes to the identity of authorised personnel must be notified to Vodafone. Vodafone will not be responsible otherwise. Individual users of subscriber lines of a business customer will only be able to view their own billing information.

Save in the circumstances where the Customer elects to cancel the receipt of paper bills, the View My Bill service is provided for information and convenience only. It is not intended to be a billing service and customers who do not pay by direct debit should await receipt of their paper bills before settling their account with Vodafone. Customers who pay by direct debit will have their accounts debited and their Vodafone bills paid in the usual manner.

**Cancellation of paper billing**

Customers who currently pay by direct debit or who elect to pay by direct debit on registration for the View My Bill service may choose to cancel their receipt of paper bills by post or cancel receipt of their Call Details by post and elect to view their bills online using View My Bill. Customers who choose to cancel the receipt of paper bills are expressly notified that they will no longer receive paper billing information and that their invoices will only be available on the View My Bill web page. Business customers currently paying by direct debit can also choose to cancel receipt of the Call Details section of the paper bill for their account on View My Bills within Business Online.

Vodafone will endeavour to notify Customers by SMS and/or email within 3 days of the Customer’s billing date that their monthly billing information is available on View My Bill(s), however it is the Customer’s responsibility to check View My Bill(s) on their billing date and thereafter and to ensure that all invoices are discharged within the time limits allowed by Vodafone’s standard terms and conditions of use

The Revenue Commissioners have confirmed that VAT registered Vodafone customers who wish to reclaim VAT on their monthly invoices must continue to receive and retain their paper monthly invoice (as required by VAT regulations), accordingly such customers must not cancel their receipt of paper bills however they can choose to cancel receipt of their Call Details by post.

Vodafone expressly disclaims insofar as is legally possible responsibility for any loss or damage arising out of the delay in placing the billing information on View My Bill(s). Vodafone and the Customer agree that Vodafone shall not be held liable for any inconvenience, loss or damage that may result from any such delay. The Customer and Vodafone expressly agree that all email notifications will be deemed delivered once the email from Vodafone advising the Customer that the billing information is available on View My Bill(s) has reached the Customer’s email service provider’s server. Vodafone and the Customer agree that the Customer’s email service provider’s server shall be the Customers “information system” for the purposes of the Electronic Commerce Act, 2000. The Customer must notify Vodafone immediately of any change of the Customer’s email address. Customers may elect to change between the receipt of paper and online bills once per month and any change shall be effective from the next billing day. Vodafone reserves the right to terminate the paperless billing aspects of the View My Bill(s) service without notice, explanation or compensation and to fully reinstate the invoicing of the Customer by paper billing information.

The View My Bill(s) service is protected by means of a password protected security system which prevents third parties viewing a customer’s billing information. Users are solely responsible for the use and safekeeping of their password which should not be shared with any third party. If incorrect log-on details are entered on three consecutive occasions, access to the Service will be denied for 24 hours. Vodafone should be notified as soon as practicable of any known or suspected unauthorised use of a password.
