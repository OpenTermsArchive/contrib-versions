Deliveroo Terms Of Service
--------------------------

**Last updated**: 15 November 2024

Welcome to Deliveroo. This page (together with the documents referred to in it) tells you the terms (the “**Terms**”) which apply when you order any items (the **"Items"**) from our deliveroo.co.uk website or mobile applications and related services (each referred to as an **“Application”**).

Please read these Terms carefully before ordering any Items from our Application. If you have any questions relating to these Terms please contact support@deliveroo.ie before you place an order. If you are a consumer, you have certain legal rights when you order Items using our Application. You can find more information about these rights at: [https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer\_affairs/consumer\_protection/consumer\_rights/](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer_affairs/consumer_protection/consumer_rights/) and from the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), https://www.ccpc.ie. Your legal rights are not affected by these Terms, which apply in addition to them and do not replace them.  By setting up your Deliveroo account, you confirm that you accept these Terms.

### 1\. Information About Us

Deliveroo Ireland Limited is a company incorporated and registered in Ireland, with a registered office at 1-2 Victoria Buildings, Haddington Road, Dublin 4, DUBLIN, Ireland.  Our Company registration number is 556923. Our VAT number is 3332774RH. You may contact us at support@deliveroo.ie or by using the instant messaging facility on our Application.

### 2\. Purpose

Our objective is to provide the Application to you, to link you to the businesses we partner with (**“Partners"**) and allow you to:

* purchase items; and
* arrange and receive delivery or collection of Items.

Where you order from a Partner, you are buying the Items from that Partner and Deliveroo acts as an agent on behalf of that Partner to conclude your order from our Application and to manage your experience throughout the order process. In plain terms, this means that it is our Partners' responsibility to complete your order, and we simply provide the platform that helps you order reach our Partner and take payment from you on their behalf.

You are also buying delivery services. How these are provided depends on who is responsible for delivery of your order:

* delivery of the Items may be arranged by Deliveroo (a "**Deliveroo Delivery**"), in which case your contract for delivery services is with Deliveroo, and Deliveroo will arrange delivery via an independently contracted rider; or
* delivery of the Items may be arranged by the Partner ("**Partner Delivery**"), in which case your contract for delivery services is with that Partner and Deliveroo acts as an agent on behalf of that Partner to conclude the transaction.

You'll be able to see when you place your order on the Application whether it is a Deliveroo Delivery or a Partner Delivery. In these terms, when we're talking about both Deliveroo Delivery and Partner Delivery together, we'll use the term "**Delivery**".

Linking you with Partners on our Application so that you can purchase Items, and providing you with delivery services for Deliveroo Delivery Orders is our "**Service**").

In some cases, the Partner may be owned by or affiliated with us.

### 3\. Your Account

Before you can place orders for Items using our Application, you need to open a Deliveroo account. When you open an account you may create a password, or other secure login method, and may also have to provide credit card details. You must keep any password you create, or other secure login method, secret, and prevent others from accessing your email account or mobile phone. If another person uses these methods to access your account, you will be responsible to pay for any Items they order, and we are not responsible for any other losses you suffer, unless the person using your password obtained it because we did not keep it secure. You must use your own, valid email address, and can have only one email address per account and only one account per customer.

You may close your account at any time by requesting to do so in your account section of our website or contacting us using the contact details above. We may suspend your access to your account, or close it permanently, if we believe that your account has been used by someone else. We may also close your account if in our opinion you are abusing our Service (for example, by applying for refunds or credit to which we do not consider you are entitled, making repeated unreasonable complaints, mistreating our staff or riders, placing orders for potentially hazardous Items in bulk quantities, or any other good reason). If we close your account permanently we will refund any remaining account credit you have validly obtained from our customer service team or Application following any issue with an order, by applying a credit to your registered credit card, or if that is not possible for any reason, by way of a bank transfer using your bank details (provided you have supplied them to us).

### 4\. Service Availability

Each Partner has a prescribed delivery area. This delivery area may change at any time due to factors such as weather, or demand on our Service. This is to ensure that Items reach your door at their best. Our Partners each decide their own operating hours. That means that the availability of our Service, and the range of Partners from which you can order, depends on the Partners in your area. If you try to order a delivery to a location outside the delivery area or operating hours of a Partner, or the Application is otherwise unavailable for any reason, we will notify you that ordering will not be possible.

### 5\. Orders

You must be aged 18 or older to use our Application and Service. By signing up for an account or by placing an order through our Application, you confirm that you are aged 18 or older. When you place an order through our Application, it needs to be accepted by us or the Partner before it is confirmed. We will send you a notification if your order has been accepted (the **"Confirmation Notice"**). The contract for the supply of any Item you have ordered comes into existence when we send the Confirmation Notice. You are responsible for paying for all Items ordered using your account, and for related delivery fees, service fees, small order fees and other fees notified to you through the Application (together the "**Order Fees**"), and for complying with these Terms, even if you have ordered the Item for someone else. A minimum order value may apply to your orders, and this may vary between different Partners. This will be displayed on our Application. All Items are subject to availability.  For food or drinks made to order, Partners may include ingredients containing allergens in their dishes or prepare food in kitchens where there is a likelihood of allergen cross contamination. Partners may display dish by dish allergens information on our platform. If you have an allergy or food intolerance and have questions, or if dish by dish allergens information is not displayed by the Partner, please contact the Partner prior to ordering. Deliveroo cannot guarantee that any of the Items sold by our Partners are free of allergens. We are not responsible for the preparation of Items offered by our Partners, and it is your responsibility to make our Partners aware of any allergies or food intolerances you may have.

### 6\. Delivery

When you place an order you will have the choice to place it as an ASAP Delivery, a Scheduled Delivery or a Priority Delivery.

* For an ASAP Delivery, we will tell you an estimated delivery time for your Item before you place the order, but we will attempt delivery as soon as possible; you must therefore be available to accept delivery from the time you place the order. 
* For a scheduled Delivery, we will tell you the time when the Item is expected to be delivered; you must be available to accept delivery within the estimated arrival time. 
* Priority Delivery guarantees that your rider will deliver your order directly to you, before delivering any other Deliveroo orders. This is an optional service that eligible customers can choose to add to their eligible orders. The price of Priority Delivery is shown when you select your delivery method, and Priority Delivery is added in addition to any other delivery fees that may be applicable. Both the price of Priority Delivery and any other delivery fees are shown before you confirm your order and pay. Deliveroo reserves the right to change the price of Priority Delivery. If your Priority Delivery arrives after the estimated maximum delivery time, you may be eligible for a refund. This does not affect your legal rights.

Unfortunately, despite our, and our Partner’s best efforts, things do not always go to plan and factors such as traffic and weather conditions may prevent us from delivering your Item on time. If your order is more than 15 minutes late, and we haven’t notified you giving you the option to cancel your order, we will work with you to make things right unless you have caused the delay (e.g. because you gave us the wrong address or did not come to the door).

We will attempt delivery at the address you provide to us when you place your order. If you need to change the delivery location after you have placed your order, we may be able to change to the address to an alternative one that is registered with your account if you let us know before the rider has been dispatched, and the new address is within the same zone as the address you originally ordered your Item to. If we cannot change the delivery address, you have the option to cancel the order, but if food preparation has started you will be charged the full price for the Item, and if the rider has been despatched you will also be charged for delivery.

You will still be charged for the Item and for Order Fees in the event of a failed delivery if you have caused such failure for any reason. Reasons you might cause a delivery to fail include (but are not limited to):  

* You do not come to the door, did not pick up the phone when the rider contacted you using the contact information you have provided us and/or you picked up the phone but then failed to provide access within a reasonable amount of time, and the rider is unable to find a safe location to leave the food.
* The rider refuses to deliver the Item to you in accordance with section 8 (Age Restricted Products).

### 7\. Your Rights if Something is Wrong With Your Items

You have a legal right to receive goods which comply with their description, which are of satisfactory quality and which comply with any specific requirements you tell us about (and we agree to) before you place your order. You also have certain legal rights where you receive a service, including that it must be carried out with reasonable care and skill. If you believe that the Items you have been delivered or the Service provided do not comply with these legal rights, please let us know. If the issue relates to your Items, we will usually deal with this on behalf of the Partner but we may refer you to the Partner to work with you to make things right. We may request a photograph showing the problem if it is something that can be seen by inspecting the Items.

For orders that you've cancelled using your statutory rights (explained in section 9) or Items that do not breach your legal rights but which are eligible for a return under the Partner's returns policy, you will have to return the Item to the Partner (or to us if you have purchased it from Deliveroo Hop) and we or the Partner will explain how to do so.

We will provide a refund or account credit in respect of the affected part of the Item, and also in respect of delivery if the whole order was affected, unless we have reasonable cause to believe that the problem was caused after delivery. Prior to processing your refund or account credit, we may take into account relevant factors including the details of the order, including your account history, what happened on delivery and information from the Partner.

You can find out more about your legal rights as a consumer if something is wrong with your Items at: [www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/consumer-laws/your-consumer-rights](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/consumer-laws/your-consumer-%20rights/.https://).

### 8\. Age Restricted and Regulated Products

Age restricted products (including, without limitation, alcohol, tobacco and cigarettes) can only be sold and delivered to persons aged 18 or over. By placing an order for an age restricted product, you confirm that you are at least 18 years old. If it's a Deliveroo Delivery, Deliveroo operates an age verification policy whereby customers ordering age restricted products will be asked by the rider to provide proof that they are aged 18 or over. Deliveroo requires that Partners operate an age verification policy for any Partner Delivery orders, and the Partner is responsible for that for Partner Delivery orders. A rider may refuse to deliver any age restricted product to any person unless they can provide valid photo ID proving that they are aged 18 or over. The Partner and the rider may refuse to deliver alcohol to any person who is, or appears to be under the influence of either alcohol or drugs. Orders for Items containing alcohol may only be delivered to a location that is a residential or business address. If delivery of any age restricted product is refused, you will still be charged for the relevant Item and for Order Fees.

### 9\. Cancellation

If you have ordered a food or drink made to order, you may cancel an order without charge at any time before the Partner has started preparing the food or drink (a **"Started Order"**). If you wish to cancel an order before it becomes a Started Order, please contact us immediately, via our Application. If the Partner confirms the order was not a Started Order, we will refund your payment (excluding any discount, or Voucher that was applied to the order - see Voucher and Account Credit Terms for more detail). If you cancel any order after it becomes a Started Order, you will be charged the full price for the Items, and if the rider has been despatched you will also be charged for Order Fees.  

Deliveroo and the Partner may notify you that an order has been cancelled at any time. You will not be charged for any orders cancelled by us or the Partner, and we will reimburse you for any payment already made using the same method you used to pay for your order. We may also apply credit to your account to reflect the inconvenience caused.

If you have ordered an Item that is non-perishable from a Partner, you usually have a legal right to change your mind about your order for any reason within 14 days and receive a refund for the order, subject to certain exceptions, including if the relevant Item(s) is likely to expire or deteriorate quickly (e.g. ready-to-eat food or flowers) or cannot be returned for hygiene reasons. Please refer to the refund or cancellation policy of the Partner you purchased the Item from for the specific terms that apply to your order. Each Partner's refund or cancellation policy can be found on their website or may be displayed by the Partner in the info section of their Deliveroo menu. If you change your mind about an order where you have a right to do so, any fees you have paid for Deliveroo Delivery and our Service (i.e. delivery fees, service fees and small order fees) is non-refundable. This is because these are fees for services that has been fully provided by Deliveroo (even though you have chosen to return the Item). The Partner's refund or cancellation policy will apply to any Partner Delivery you have paid for. Our right to withhold the fees for Deliveroo Delivery and our Service also applies if you have caused a failed delivery in accordance with section 6 (Delivery).

### 10\. Prices, Payments and Offers

Prices include VAT. You confirm that you are using our Service for personal, non-commercial use. Deliveroo may operate dynamic pricing some of the time, which means that prices of Items and delivery may change while you are browsing. Prices can also change at any time at the discretion of the Partner. We reserve the right to charge a service fee, which may be subject to change, for the provision of our Services.  You will be notified of any applicable Order Fees and taxes prior to purchase on the checkout page on our Application.  No changes will affect existing confirmed orders, unless there is an obvious pricing mistake. Nor will changes to prices affect any orders in process and appearing within your basket, provided you complete the order within 2 hours of creating the basket. If you do not conclude the order before the 2 hour cut-off the items will be removed from your basket automatically and the price change will apply. If there is an obvious pricing mistake we will notify you as soon as we can and you will have the choice of confirming the order at the original price or cancelling the order without charge and with a full refund of any money already paid. Where Deliveroo or any Partner makes a delivery, we or the Partner may also charge you a delivery fee. This will be notified to you during the order process before you complete your order.

The total price of your order will be set out on the checkout page on our Application, including the prices of Items and Delivery and applicable Order Fees and taxes.

Payment for all Items and deliveries can be made on our Application by credit or debit card, or other payment method made available by Deliveroo. Once your order has been confirmed your credit or debit card will be authorised and the total amount marked for payment. Payment for all Items and for Partner Delivery is made directly to Deliveroo acting as agent on behalf of the Partner only. Payment for Deliveroo Delivery, service fees and small order fees is made directly to Deliveroo. Payment may also be made by using vouchers or account credit. Use of these is subject to Deliveroo's Voucher and Account Credit Terms.

We are authorised by our Partners to accept payment on their behalf and payment of the price of any Items or Partner Delivery fees to us will fulfil your obligation to pay the price to the Partner. In some cases, you can alternatively make your payment in cash directly to the Partner by paying the rider at the time of delivery.  Where cash payment is possible, this will be made clear on our Application before you place your order.

Partners sometimes make special offers available through our Application. These are visible when you look at a Partner menu. These offers are at the discretion of the Partners. Unless the offer terms state a fixed or minimum period for which an offer will be available, it can be withdrawn at any time, unless you have already placed an order based on the offer and we have sent the Confirmation Notice.

### 11\. Tips

**When Placing Your Order:**

When you place an order, you will have the option to pay a tip to your rider or the Partner,  in addition to the purchase price of the Items in your order. Any payment will be collected by Deliveroo using the payment method used for the original order and your rider or the Partner will receive 100% of any payment you choose to make.

If you have purchased an Item from a Partner, please refer to the refund or cancellation policy of the Partner you purchased the Item from for the terms that apply to you. Any tip paid to the rider will not be refunded, if you change your mind about the Item.

**After You’ve Received Your Order:**

Once you’ve received your order, you may receive a notification giving you the chance to pay a tip to your rider. Deliveroo will collect payment on behalf of the rider, as their limited payment collection agent, and payment of the tips shall be considered a direct payment from you to the rider. We’ll share your first name with your rider when we notify them of the tip. Your rider will receive 100% of any payment you choose to make. As this payment is made after you receive your order, this payment is non-refundable and does not form part of your order. This applies even if you change your mind about an Item or if something is wrong with your Item. Depending on the payment method used for your original order, your tip may show up on your bank/credit card statement as a separate payment.

### 12\. Our Responsibility for Loss and Damage That You Suffer

We are responsible to you for any loss or damage that you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breaking these Terms or of failing to use reasonable care and skill in relation to your use of our Service. We are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is “foreseeable” if it is either obvious that it will happen, or if you told us that it might happen, for example if you tell us about particular circumstances that might increase the loss or damage arising from our breach of these Terms before you place an order.

We do not exclude or limit our responsibility to you for loss or damage where it would be unlawful to do so. This includes any responsibility for death or personal injury caused by our failure, or our employees’, agents’ or subcontractors’ failure, to use reasonable care and skill; for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; for breach of your legal rights in relation to the Items, as summarised at part 7 above; or for defective Items under applicable legislation including the Consumer Protection Act 2007 (as amended), Consumer Rights Act 2022 and the Liability for Defective Products Act 1991 (as amended). Subject to the previous paragraph, we are not responsible for any loss or damage that you suffer as a result of your own breach of these Terms, or as a result of any IT hardware or software failure other than a failure in our Applications.  

### 13\. Data Protection

We process your personal data in accordance with our Privacy Policy which can be found [here](https://deliveroo.co.uk/privacy).

### 14\. Other Terms

If either we or you have any right to enforce these Terms against the other, that right will not be lost even if the person who has the right delays enforcing it, or waives their right to enforce it in any instance.  If a court or other authority decides that any part of these Terms is illegal or ineffective, the rest of the terms will be unaffected and will remain in force.

We may change these Terms from time to time. If we make any changes which affect your rights in relation to our Service, we will notify you. Changes to the Terms will not affect any orders you have placed where we have sent the Confirmation Notice. These Terms are governed by the law of Ireland and you can bring legal proceedings in relation to our Service in the Irish courts. We are required by EU law to provide [this link](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/main/index.cfm?event=main.home2.show&lng=EN) to the EU’s online dispute resolution portal, however we do not participate in dispute resolution under this process.

### 15\. Rankings

We may rank our Partners in consideration of their reviews by consumers, their popularity (number of Orders) and/or our commercial agreements with these partners.

These rankings are displayed for partners from your region when you access our Apps.

For further information on how we rank our Partners, you’ll find a dedicated section in our FAQ.

Deliveroo Voucher and Account Credit Terms
------------------------------------------

### 1\. Introduction

Deliveroo makes available from time to time: (i) **Vouchers** (which are promotional credits that may be offered by us or by Partner Restaurants on our Site) and (ii) **Account Credit** (which is credit that may be applied to a customer’s account at Deliveroo’s discretion). Vouchers and Account Credits both operate as credits applying to a customer’s Deliveroo account, redeemable (subject to conditions, as set out below) against the cost of Items. Vouchers and Account Credits are referred to collectively in these terms (the **Credit Terms**) as **Credits**.

These Credit Terms apply to your use of any Credits to pay for Items using the Deliveroo Service. These Credit Terms apply together with the Deliveroo Terms and Conditions of Service, which continue to apply unless they conflict with these Credit Terms, in which case these Credit Terms have priority. Capitalised words used in these Credit Terms have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service unless they are defined in these Credit Terms.

You can “apply” a voucher to your account by (i) entering the Voucher code (if any) at the point you place an order, or (ii) by adding any reward that we make available to you in the “Your offers and rewards” section of your account page. Unless otherwise stated, a voucher that has been applied to your account will remain there until it is “redeemed” against an eligible order, or expires (whichever is sooner).  Account Credits are Credits that we apply to your account ourselves. In either case, once any Credit has been applied to your account, the amount of the Credit remains on your account until redeemed as payment for Items, unless it is lost, or, in the case of Vouchers, it expires in accordance with the terms of that Voucher. The reasons why Credits may be lost or Vouchers may expire are set out in these Credit Terms.

### 2\. Terms that apply to Vouchers only

Vouchers offered in a particular country and currency may be subject to geographical restrictions that mean they cannot be used in a different country or currency. Vouchers are usually offered subject to conditions, such as time limits, geographic limits, limits to particular categories of customer (eg new customers), or use only at a particular Partner Restaurant or for a particular menu item. If conditions apply they will be stated when we offer the Voucher.

Some Vouchers are only available to new Deliveroo customers ("New Customer Vouchers"). That means that the Voucher is applied (subject to any other applicable conditions) automatically when the Customer registers a new Deliveroo account and will be redeemed when the Customer places their first eligible order. Deliveroo reserves the right to refuse to apply and/or allow you to redeem a new customer Voucher if you are registering a new account using credit card details or a delivery name and address already on our system.

Use of a Voucher in payment or part-payment may also be subject to specific conditions applicable to that Voucher only, such as a specific minimum order value or that the Voucher may only be redeemed at specific Partner Restaurants or on specific Items. If the order placed does not comply with the applicable conditions, the Credit may not be redeemed against that order. The payment page on our Site where you confirm your order for Items will show the total order value and the applicable Voucher, if any. If there is a Voucher credit on your account which does not apply to your order, it will not appear on the payment page. At that point you will have the choice of paying in another way or cancelling the order.

Unless we tell you otherwise, all Vouchers must be redeemed within one calendar month of the date they are applied.

Only one Voucher can be redeemed per order. Each Voucher can only be used once per customer.  If you have more than one eligible Voucher applied to your account when you place an order, the Vouchers are redeemed in order of expiry date, with the Voucher expiring the earliest redeemed first.  

Vouchers cannot be redeemed in conjunction with any other Deliveroo offer.

If you cancel an order made using a Voucher, the Voucher credit will not be restored to the account and the Voucher cannot be re-used. If the Voucher was a New Customer Voucher, you will no longer be a new customer and will not be eligible for any subsequent new customer Vouchers.

### 3\. Terms that apply to Vouchers and Account Credit

Item orders are generally subject to minimum order values, which continue to apply regardless of whether payment or part-payment is by way of a Credit.

Credits cannot be exchanged for cash or any other alternatives and have no monetary value.

Any attempt to manipulate our Site and our offers of Credits by use of bulk entry via third parties or syndicates, macros, ‘script’, ‘brute force’, masking identity by manipulating IP addresses, using identities other than their own or any other automated means (including systems which can be programmed to enter), will render the order and the relevant Credit invalid. Deliveroo is entitled to take all reasonable steps to protect itself against fraudulent or invalid Credit redemptions, including requiring additional reasonable verification close the accounts of any customers it reasonably believes have carried out any such acts.

Deliveroo Gift Card Terms and Conditions
----------------------------------------

**Last updated: 15 November 2024**

This page sets out the terms that apply to Gift Cards supplied by Deliveroo Ireland Limited (“**Deliveroo**”), a company registered in Ireland with registered number 556923.  Our registered address is 1-2 Victoria Buildings, Haddington Road, Dublin 4, DUBLIN, Ireland.  

Please read these terms carefully before purchasing or using any Gift Card on our Service. By purchasing or using a Gift Card, you confirm your acceptance of these terms. We may change these terms and from time to time, so we recommend that you check back regularly. 

All Gift Cards are issued and fulfilled by Deliveroo. Direct sales to consumers on [deliverooeu.launchgiftcards.com](http://deliverooeu.launchgiftcards.com/) are managed by Launch Gift Cards, Inc (“**LGC**”). LGC is incorporated in Delaware, with its offices located at 16501 Ventura Blvd Suite 410 Encino, CA 9143. Deliveroo may also work with other third party resellers from time to time at its discretion.

These Gift Card terms and any contractual or non-contractual dispute or claim arising out of them are governed by the laws of Ireland and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Irish courts.

These terms have two parts: 

1. **Terms about purchasing Gift Cards**
2. **Terms about using Gift Cards**

### **Terms about purchasing Gift Cards**

#### **1\. Who can purchase Gift Cards?**

If you are a business registered in Ireland or an individual customer, you are eligible to place an order for the purchase of Deliveroo Gift Cards (“**Order**”). Orders may be subject to a minimum Order and/or maximum value.  Deliveroo may refuse an Order in its discretion, including if Deliveroo believes an Order is not a genuine purchase.

#### **2\. Payments**

Payment for your Order must be made via credit card, charge card or debit card or, if available, via bank transfer at the time that the Order is placed. Service fees may apply to your purchase of Gift Cards.  

Exceptionally, we may agree to accept payment after the time of Order - this is always subject to our written approval and may be subject to credit checks. If we do give this approval, payment must be made within 14 days of the placement of the Order.  

#### **3\. Delivery of Gift Cards**

Deliveroo is under no obligation to issue any Gift Cards until full payment for your Order has been received. Title to a Gift Card passes to you on full payment. 

All digital Gift Cards will be sent to you by email and all physical Gift Cards will be sent to you by post. Risk in a Gift Card passes to you upon delivery. If there are any issues with your Order, you must notify Deliveroo within 72 hours of delivery. 

#### **4\. Refunds**

Purchases of Gift Cards by businesses are non-refundable. Purchases of Gift Cards by consumers (but not businesses) have a 14 day refund period from date of receipt as long as you have not started using your Gift Card, after which they are non-refundable. Please contact the LGC support team at [deliverooeu@launchgiftcards.com](mailto:deliverooeu@launchgiftcards.com) for your refund.. On refund, Gift Cards will be cancelled and the Gift Card will become void. 

Deliveroo reserves the right not to fulfil a Gift Card that has not been redeemed, in which case the purchaser will be refunded. 

#### **5\. Cancellation**

In the event that, in respect of business purchasers:: 

* you make any voluntary arrangement with your creditors or become the subject of any administration, liquidation or winding up order; 
* a receiver or administrative receiver is appointed over your assets; 
* you suspend or threaten to suspend any payments hereunder or threaten to cease to carry on business; or 
* Deliveroo reasonably considers that you are about to suffer any of the events above, 

Deliveroo may cancel its contracts with you, suspend any further Orders from being placed or fulfilled and deactivate any Gift Cards which have not been paid for, without liability to you. 

#### **6\. Limitation of Liability**

Deliveroo will not be liable, in respect of Orders from businesses, in contract, tort (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise pursuant to or in connection with these terms for:

* any economic losses (including without limitation loss of revenues, profits, contracts, business or anticipated savings); 
* any loss of goodwill or reputation; or
* any special, indirect, inconsequential, exemplary, incidental or punitive losses,

suffered or incurred by you out of or in connection with the provision of any Gift Cards or under these terms. In the event that a Gift Card does not work, your sole remedy and our sole liability will be the replacement of the Gift Card.

Nothing in these terms excludes or limits our liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or fraud.

#### **7\. Use of Deliveroo Brand** 

You may not use any trade mark, logo, service mark, designation, product image or any other trading name or get-up of Deliveroo (“**Deliveroo Brand**”) without our prior written consent. We may withdraw such consent at any time by notifying you. 

#### **8\. Privacy policy**

Deliveroo’s privacy policy (available on [https://deliveroo.ie/privacy](https://deliveroo.ie/privacy)) explains how we collect or handle personal information.

#### **9\. General**

In addition to these terms, the general Deliveroo terms and conditions found on [https://deliveroo.ie/legal](https://deliveroo.ie/legal) will apply to your purchase of Gift Cards. 

A person who is not a party to these terms and conditions cannot enforce or take the benefit of any of these terms.

Deliveroo reserves the right to prevent third parties from distributing, reselling or advertising its Gift Cards, at its own discretion.

#### **10\. Contact**

Contact [corporateservice@deliveroo.ie](http://corporateservice@deliveroo.ie/) (if you are a business) or LGC’s support team at [deliverooeu@launchgiftcards.com](mailto:deliverooeu@launchgiftcards.com) (if you are a consumer) for further details or if you have any questions.

### **Terms about using Gift Cards**

#### 1\. What can Gift Cards be used for?

Deliveroo Gift Cards may only be redeemed for purchases of menu items from [www.deliveroo.ie](http://www.deliveroo.ie/) or the Deliveroo Ireland app.

Gift Cards cannot be: 

* topped up or reloaded;
* redeemed alongside promotional codes or promotional vouchers;
* used to pay for subscriptions (e.g. for Deliveroo Plus) or to purchase Deliveroo Gift Cards;
* redeemed for cash;
* resold or transferred for value; or
* transferred to another Deliveroo account, once redeemed.

#### 2\. When does my Gift Card expire?

Your Gift Card expires on the date stated on the email in which the Gift Card was delivered by us. If there is no expiry date specified (or the date stated on the email in which the Gift Card was delivered is less than 5 years after the date your Gift Card was purchased) your Gift Card will expire 5 years after the date the Gift Card was purchased. 

Once you redeem your Gift Card, you must use that credit before the expiry date of the Gift Card. Any credit that has not been spent by the expiry date will be cancelled and will no longer be available in your Deliveroo account.

#### 3\. How do I redeem my Gift Card?

To redeem your Gift Card, enter the unique code on the Gift Card at the checkout when you place your next order and your Deliveroo account will be credited with the amount loaded on your Gift Card. Once credited to a Deliveroo account Gift Cards are non-refundable and non-transferable. In addition, we reserve the right to discuss a Gift Card with the Deliveroo account holder only once a Gift Card has been redeemed.

#### 4\. What happens if my order is for more or less than my Gift Card balance?

If your purchase exceeds your total credit, the rest of your order must be paid with another payment method accepted under our general terms (see [www.deliveroo.ie/legal](http://www.deliveroo.ie/legal)). Cash cannot be used to pay for the balance of the cost of an order where a Gift Card is used as part-payment.

If your purchase is less than your total credit, the balance of your credit will remain available on your account for future purchases. To view your credit balance, visit your Deliveroo account.

#### 5\. What happens to my credit if my order is cancelled?

If you use credit (in full or in part) to pay for your Deliveroo order and your order is cancelled or you are entitled to a refund, your refund will be issued to you in the same form as the original payment was made (i.e. as a credit). There will be no monetary exchange for returned or cancelled orders made with credit.

#### 6\. What happens if my Gift Card is lost, stolen or destroyed?

Please look after your Gift Card. Deliveroo is not responsible if any Gift Card is lost, stolen, damaged, destroyed or used without your permission and if this happens your Gift Card will not be replaced.

#### **7\. Fraud and abuse**

Deliveroo is not responsible for Gift Cards sold or distributed by an unauthorised third party.

If an Gift Card is abused, or an Gift Card which we know or suspect was obtained fraudulently is redeemed and/or used to make purchases on our service, Deliveroo may:

* suspend or close the affected customer account (and any credit remaining on the affected customer account will be cancelled and is non-refundable);
* cancel any Gift Cards; and/or 
* take legal action. 

#### **8\. Deliveroo General Terms**  

When you use your Gift Card on our website or our app, the general Deliveroo terms at [https://deliveroo.ie/legal](https://deliveroo.ie/legal) will also apply.

#### **9\. Privacy Policy**

Deliveroo’s privacy policy (available on [https://deliveroo.co.uk/privacy](https://deliveroo.co.uk/privacy)) explains how we use your personal information.

#### **10\. How do I get help?**

If you are a business and are having issues with your Gift Card, please contact our support team at [corporateservice@deliveroo.ie](mailto:corporateservice@deliveroo.ie). If you are a consumer and are having issues with your Gift Card, please contact LGC’s support team at [deliverooeu@launchgiftcards.com](mailto:deliverooeu@launchgiftcards.com) for further details or if you have any questions. 

Referral Program Terms
----------------------

1. This Referral Programme is open to selected Deliveroo customers (‘you’/’user') aged 18 or over who have made at least 1 Deliveroo order.
2. We will notify you by email that you are eligible for the Referral Programme. The email will include a unique link. Simply share your unique link with a friend or relative (aged 18 or over) who does not live at the same address as you and who you think would benefit from the Deliveroo service (a “referral”). If anyone to whom you give a referral goes on to place a Deliveroo order using that unique link, we will apply to your account the amount of Deliveroo Voucher credit stated in the email we sent to you with the unique link. It may take up to seven days after your relative of friend places a referral order before the Voucher credit is applied to your account. Voucher credits received under the Referral Program can be redeemed at any Partner Restaurant and expire automatically within the period stated in the promotional materials or other associated Deliveroo materials.
3. Unique links may only be used for personal and non-commercial purposes. This means that you can share your unique link with your personal connections via your own social media accounts (eg your personal Facebook, Twitter or Instagram account) but not on sites where you are a contributor but not the account owner (eg Facebook business accounts or groups, Wikipedia, Google Reviews, coupon websites). Promoting your referral code via Search Engine Marketing (eg AdWords / Yahoo / Bing) is also not allowed. If we become aware that you have made your unique link available in any of these ways we may deactivate it without telling you. We will not be responsible for any losses you suffer if we deactivate your account for this reason.
4. We may discontinue the Referral Programme at any time. We will give advance notice of discontinuance on our Site. Voucher credit already applied to your account as a result of referrals will remain available for the period as stated in Clause 2 above, even if the Referral Programme is discontinued.
5. Referral credits are Vouchers and are therefore subject to the above Voucher Terms and Conditions.
6. You may receive Voucher credit for a maximum of 100 referrals. We reserve the right to change the maximum number of referrals for which Voucher credit is awarded at any time, though you will receive Voucher credit for any referral orders placed by your relatives or friends before the change.
7. The Promoter is Deliveroo Ireland Limited, 15 Flemmings Place, Dublin 4, D0 P6W3.

These T&Cs apply to you if you subscribe to have a Deliveroo Plus account. These do not replace the Terms and Conditions of Service for your Deliveroo account or the Deliveroo Terms of Use for Website and Applications, which will continue to apply except to the extent these T&C vary them.

We know these T&Cs are quite long to read! You can find a summary in the Deliveroo Plus Customers FAQ sheet (“Customer FAQ”) – [https://deliveroo.ie/faq](https://deliveroo.ie/faq)

The Customer FAQ should not be used as a substitute for reading the Deliveroo Plus Terms and Conditions.

Deliveroo Plus acting in its sole discretion  may offer selected Eligible Users  other types of benefits at its discretion (for example, partner offers, special promotions, memberships, or services) which may among other things depend on the Eligible User’s location and/or frequency of use of the Service.

Occasionally we may make changes to Deliveroo Plus including the benefits available to you and/or these Terms. We will communicate any material changes to you prior to being implemented via email or by displaying a prominent notice on our Service (“Change Communication”).

If you added the Payment Method to your account when you signed up to Deliveroo, it will be automatically removed when you cancel.

●      Failed Payment: If payment of the applicable Deliveroo Plus Fee is not successfully settled, due to expiration of your Payment Method, insufficient funds or otherwise, and you do not edit the Payment Method information within 24 hours of being notified of a failed payment Deliveroo will cancel your Deliveroo Plus subscription effective immediately and you will no longer receive the Deliveroo Plus service.

●      Price Changes: We reserve the right to adjust pricing of your Deliveroo Plus membership at any time. Any price changes to your Deliveroo Plus membership will take effect on your next Deliveroo Plus Subscription Period. We will notify you of any change in price via a Change Communication. Subject to applicable law, if following a Change Communication you continue to use the Service after the price change has taken effect, you will be deemed to have accepted the new price.  If you do not accept the new price, you must cancel your Plus Subscription before the price change is implemented.

### **7\. Managing Your Deliveroo Plus Account**

All information relating to your Deliveroo Plus membership will be contained in the “My Account” section of your profile under “Deliveroo Plus”. From here, you will be able to view the remaining time on your Free Trial Period, cancel your Deliveroo Plus membership and update your Payment Method.

### **8\. Pausing your Plus Subscription ("Plus Pausing")**

The Plus Pausing feature allows you to pause your Deliveroo Plus subscription. 

If you choose to pause your Plus subscription:

* You lose access to all Plus benefits for the period your Plus subscription remains paused. 
* Any days remaining on your Deliveroo Plus Subscription Period at the time of pausing are frozen. You can use them after you unpause your Deliveroo Plus Subscription.
* We won’t charge you anything until you unpause and have used any remaining days on your paused Deliveroo Plus Subscription Period. 

After you unpause:

* You will get access to all Plus benefits.
* You can’t pause your Deliveroo Plus subscription again for another 30 days.
* You can use all of your frozen days that were remaining on your previous Deliveroo Plus Subscription Period when you cancelled. After all your remaining “frozen” days are used, we will then charge you the Deliveroo Plus Fee for the next Deliveroo Plus Subscription period. 
* Your Deliveroo Plus Subscription Period date may change from what it is before you paused your subscription.
* All payments will be made in accordance with section 6 (Payment and Billing). E.g. if you pause with 10 days remaining in your payment cycle, after you unpause, you’ll first use the 10 days and only after that we’ll charge you for the next Deliveroo Plus Subscription Period.

If you choose to pause your Deliveroo Plus subscription and it remains paused for three months or more, Deliveroo may email to notify you that your Plus subscription will be automatically cancelled unless you unpause within the time period specified in the email. If you do not unpause, your account may be cancelled and you will lose any days remaining at the time of pausing.

If these Terms are updated while you have paused your Deliveroo Plus Subscription, the updated Terms will apply as soon as you have unpaused, or the date of commencement of the updated Terms, whichever occurs later. 

If Deliveroo decides to terminate the Plus Subscription entirely or in an area affecting you while your Deliveroo Plus Subscription is paused, your Deliveroo Plus Subscription will also be cancelled along with the subscription program.

Deliveroo may amend or remove this right at its sole discretion.

### **9\. Cancellation**

Cancellation of Deliveroo Plus: You may terminate your Deliveroo Plus subscription at any time. Following cancellation, you will continue to receive the Deliveroo Plus service for the duration of your current Deliveroo Plus Subscription Period. If you cancel a free trial the Plus benefits will cease immediately. If you cancel within your Cooling Off Period you will be entitled to a full refund.

Cooling Off Period: You have a right to cancel a Deliveroo Plus membership  during the Cooling-Off Period. The Cooling-Off Period will expire either:

○      after 14 days from the day of your initial sign up date or

○      at the expiry of the Free Trial Period.

Exercising Your Right to Cancel: To exercise the right to cancel under this section, you may either use the option within “My Account” area of your profile or you must inform our Customer Support Team by email (at [support@deliveroo.ie](mailto:support@deliveroo.ie)) of your decision to cancel your Deliveroo Plus membership by clear statement.

Reimbursement: If you cancel your Deliveroo Plus membership during the Cooling-Off Period, we will reimburse you for the payment you have made at the date of cancellation. If a reimbursement is due and payable to you, we will make the reimbursement without undue delay, and not later than 14 days after the day on which we are informed about your decision to cancel this contract using the same means of payment as you have used to pay your Deliveroo Plus Subscription Fee.

### **10\. Termination Or Modification**

You agree that Deliveroo, in its sole discretion, may terminate, deactivate and/or suspend any account (or part thereof) you may have with us or use of the Service and remove and discard all or part of your account and/or discontinue, modify or alter any aspect, feature or policy of the Service or Deliveroo Plus. In the event that Deliveroo terminates, deactivates and/or suspends your account (for any reason other than in relation to a breach of these Terms and Conditions) Deliveroo will reimburse your Fee on a pro-rata basis.

Deliveroo Review Community Guidelines
-------------------------------------

Once you have received your order, you will be given the opportunity to share your experience with other users by leaving a review via our website or App (“**Site**”). You will be able to give a star rating (between 1 (being very poor) and 5 (being very good)), and write a review relating to your experience of our Partner Restaurants, their menu and the Items on your order (a “**Review**”). 

These Deliveroo review guidelines (“**Guidelines**”) apply alongside, and should be read together with, our Terms of Service (above). If there is any conflict between these Guidelines and our Terms of Service, these Guidelines will control. Capitalised terms used in these Guidelines that are defined in the Terms of Service have the meanings given to them in the Terms of Service. Before leaving a Review we ask that you read and observe these Guidelines.

**Review standards** 

Reviews submitted by our users are important to our quality control process. As such, any Review you submit should be accurate and reflect your own genuine experience. Reviews are posted on the profile page of our Partner Restaurants on our Site. Partner Restaurants will be given the opportunity to respond privately to your Review. Your Review may have an impact on whether other users choose to purchase from a Partner Restaurant. 

Each Review you submit must meet the following standards: 

**Second-Hand Experiences**

You must only write about your own first-hand experience as a customer of a Restaurant Partner.  You will only be able to post a Review once you are logged into your Deliveroo account so that we may verify you as a genuine customer.  You should not write a Review on behalf of any other person. 

You are not permitted to Review any Restaurant Partner if you are employed by another restaurant or food and beverage establishment, or if you are related to or are friends with a current employee or owner of a restaurant or food and beverage establishment.

Restaurant Partners are not permitted to Review themselves under any circumstances. Users must not impersonate another person or misrepresent their affiliation with another person.

We do not allow any payment or other incentive that may influence the posting or removal of Reviews.

**Original Content**

Your Review should be your own original material and not copied or plagiarised, or if you are referencing any content or quotes from any other source, you must ensure that you have been given permission to include that content or quote in your Review. 

We may remove Reviews that mention quotes or descriptions from media, internet or another source, including incidental mentions of another person’s experience.

**Relevance to Reviewer Experience**

Your Review should be directly relevant to your experience of a Restaurant Partner.  For example, Reviews that relate to an experience with a Restaurant partner not relevant to the items available on the Site may be removed (for example, commenting on a recent event affecting the Restaurant Partner that attracted media attention, for example, a health and safety event, that was not relevant to your experience).  

We may remove Reviews that discuss political preferences, ethical differences, religion or reviewers’ perspectives on wider social issues, unless it is clear how these matters directly impacted your experience of a Restaurant Partner.

Reviews must not be used to promote or commercialise any third party products or services, or include any links to websites.

**Recent Experiences**

We want to ensure Reviews appearing on the Site are relevant and current.  Reviews that are more than 2 years old will be archived.

**Sexually Explicit, Prejudicial and Unlawful Content**

Reviews should offer helpful insights for other customers.  We wish to offer a safe and authentic forum for users to express themselves in relation to their experiences with the goods and services available on our Site.  

Under no circumstances may you post a Review that contains sexually explicit, graphic, obscene, offensive or violent content, or refers to any unlawful activity (such as drug taking).  

Further, Reviews must be respectful and may not be defamatory or reflect any intolerance, offensive stereotypes or other language that may incite hatred or discrimination towards people based on their ethnic or social origin, race, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, religious/spiritual beliefs, socioeconomic class, physical or mental ability, immigration status or nationality.

**Profane and Vulgar Language**

You should refrain from using vulgar or profane terms or expletives. We recognise that certain terms have different meanings depending on language and culture and we seek to be sensitive to that.

**Personal Information**

Reviews are available to the public so we strongly discourage users sharing any personal or confidential information, such as passwords, email addresses, full names and home addresses. 

**Removal and editing of Reviews** 

We reserve the right to, but have no obligation to (unless required by law), remove or edit any Review at any time if we determine, in our sole discretion, that it does not meet the standards set out in these Guidelines, including where there is a risk that the Review may expose us, our Partner Restaurants or any other third party to harm or liability.
