How we use cookies
------------------

At Deliveroo we, and our third party partners, use cookies and similar technologies as described in this Cookie Policy and in our [customer](https://deliveroo.ie/privacy) and/or [rider](https://rider.deliveroo.ie/rider-privacy) privacy policies.

What are cookies and similar technologies?
------------------------------------------

Cookies and similar technologies are pretty cool. We use these to enhance your online experience, in particular to: 

* allow our websites and apps to function properly, for example, by remembering your login details or the items you’ve put in your basket, 
* analyse and improve our services, including our websites, apps and communications (such as our emails and push notifications),
* personalise your online experience on Deliveroo, and 
* show you relevant Deliveroo adverts when you browse other websites or apps.

Cookies are small files that are stored on your device, often in the form of a unique identifier, and may collect information associated with your device when you visit our websites. Similar technologies include things like ‘web beacons’, ‘pixels’ or ‘tags’ on our websites and in our communications, which work in a similar way to cookies. 

On our apps, we use software development kits (often referred to as ‘SDKs’) some of which may also collect information associated with your device. Unless otherwise mentioned, when we refer to ‘cookies’, we are referring to any of these technologies.

The information collected by cookies when you use a Deliveroo website or app, can include your preferred language or account login information, the device and/or browser you are using, the date and time of visits and how you are using the website or app (for example, what webpages you view the most).

We use first party and third party cookies. First party cookies are cookies placed by us to collect information about you. Third party cookies are those that we allow third parties to place on our websites and apps and this information may be shared with and used by those relevant third parties for their own purposes. We’ve named these third parties in this Cookie Policy and you can refer to their privacy policies for details of the information they collect about you and how they use it.

What types of cookies do we use?
--------------------------------

### **Strictly necessary cookies**

These cookies are necessary for our websites, apps or services to function properly and cannot be turned off. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you, for example so you can create your account, sign in and place orders. They also remember your selected currency, language, past searches and other preferences.

### **Analytics cookies**

These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our websites, apps and services. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around our websites and apps. If you do not allow these cookies we will not be able to monitor the performance of our websites, apps and services.

### **Functional cookies**

These cookies enable our websites and apps to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation. If you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these services may not function properly.

### **Advertising cookies**

These cookies are used by us and our advertising partners to build a profile of your interests based on your browsing history and use of our websites and apps and to show you relevant ads on our websites and apps and on other third party platforms (including social media). These cookies may also measure the effectiveness of this advertising. They may also allow you to quickly share content across social media (through the use of simple “sharing” buttons) or sign in to our services using your social media account.

Advertising cookies do this by uniquely identifying your browser and device.  We may also share other data relating to you and/or your use of our services with our advertising partners. 

If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising. For more information about how we and our advertising partners use your personal information to serve relevant ads, please see our [customer](https://deliveroo.ie/privacy) privacy policy.

How long do cookies last?
-------------------------

Our websites cookies differ between:
