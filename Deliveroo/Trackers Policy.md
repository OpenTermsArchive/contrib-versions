At Deliveroo we use cookies and other similar technologies like pixels and tags to allow our website to work, to analyse and improve it, to personalise your experience and to show you relevant advertising. Here’s a breakdown of what that means for you.

What are cookies?
-----------------

Cookies are pretty cool. They make your online experience personalised by helping us show you relevant Deliveroo adverts when you browse other websites, helping us to understand how you are using our own website, and saving you lots of time by remembering your details. But how do they do it?

Cookies are actually small files that are stored on your computer or phone. They store small bits of data so that when you visit a website, it can remember your preferences and make sure it shows you content that is relevant to you.

All cookies have expiry dates that determine how long they stay in your browser:

*   Session cookies are temporary cookies that expire automatically whenever you close your browser.
*   Persistent cookies usually stay in your browser for a set period, or until you manually delete them.

How we track emails
-------------------

Every email we send to you contains small gif files known as tracking pixels.

These are small graphic files that contain unique identifiers that enable us to recognise when our marketing subscribers have opened an email or clicked certain links. This allows us to record each subscriber's email address, IP address, device ID, date, and time associated with each open and click for a campaign.

We use this data to create reports about how interesting or useful our marketing campaigns were to our users, then we can adjust them to make our campaigns more relevant. For example, if you never open emails about sushi, we'll start to assume you don't want to receive emails about sushi!
