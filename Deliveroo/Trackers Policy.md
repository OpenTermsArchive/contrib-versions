How we use cookies
------------------

At Deliveroo we and our third-party partners use cookies and other similar technologies described in this Cookie Policy to allow our websites and apps to work, to analyse and improve our websites, apps and communications, to personalise your experience on Deliveroo and to show you relevant advertising. Please read this Cookie Policy together with our [Customer](https://deliveroo.co.uk/privacy) and/or [Rider](https://rider.deliveroo.co.uk/rider-privacy) Privacy Policies for details of what that means for you.

What are cookies and similar technologies?
------------------------------------------

Cookies and similar technologies are pretty cool. They can make your online experience personalised by helping us show you relevant Deliveroo adverts when you browse other websites or apps, help us to understand how you are using our services (including our website and apps) and our emails, and save you lots of time by remembering your details. But how do they do it?

Cookies are small files that are stored on your device and often a unique identifier. They store small bits of data when you visit a website. We also use similar technologies to cookies, such as ‘web beacons’, ‘pixels’ or ‘tags’ on our websites and in our emails, and SDKs in our mobile applications, which do a similar job to cookies. In mobile apps these technologies may collect and use the advertising identifier associated with your device. From now on we will refer to all of these technologies as ‘cookies’ for ease.

Cookies collect, record and share information about you and/or your device when you view a website, app or email. This information can include your language preference or login information, the device and/or browser you are using, the date and time of visits, and how you are using a website or app (for example, what pages you view the most).

We use ‘first party cookies’ and ‘third party cookies’. First party cookies are cookies placed by us to collect information about you. Third party cookies are cookies placed by third parties and information may be shared with and used by the relevant third party for their own purposes. Where set out in this Cookie Policy, please refer to the relevant third party’s privacy notice for more information about the information they collect and how they use it.

For more information about cookies please visit [All About Cookies](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

How long do cookies last?
-------------------------

Cookies usually have expiry dates that determine how long they stay in your browser or on your device:

*   Session cookies are temporary cookies that expire automatically whenever you close your browser.
*   Persistent cookies usually stay in your browser for a set period, or until you manually delete them.

What cookies do we use?
-----------------------

You can learn more about the individual cookies that Deliveroo uses on each Deliveroo website and the function they perform in our Cookies Settings . For general information on why we use cookies, please see the sections below.

Strictly necessary cookies
--------------------------

These cookies are necessary for the website or service to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work. 

Analytics cookies
-----------------

These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site and digital services. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our site or used our service, and will not be able to monitor the performance of the site or service.

Functional cookies
------------------

These cookies enable the website or service to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation when you use Deliveroo. If you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these services may not function properly.

Advertising cookies
-------------------

These cookies (also known as targeting cookies or social media cookies) may be set through our site or digital service by us or our third-party partners. They may be used by us and those third parties to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites and services. They do this by uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising. These cookies may also measure the effectiveness of advertising. They may also allow you to quickly share content across social media (through the use of simple “sharing” buttons) or sign in to our services using your social media account.

How we track emails
-------------------

Our emails to you contain analytics cookies (see above for more information about these). These enable us to recognise when our marketing subscribers have opened an email or clicked certain links. This allows us to record each subscriber's email address, IP address, device ID, date, and time associated with each open and click for a campaign.

We use this data to create reports about how interesting or useful our marketing campaigns were to our users, then we can adjust them to make our campaigns more relevant. 

Is consent needed to use cookies?
---------------------------------

Most of the time, we need your consent to use cookies (and you don’t need to give it if you don’t want to). However, where we use necessary or essential cookies, we do not need your consent but you can still block or delete them, as described above.
