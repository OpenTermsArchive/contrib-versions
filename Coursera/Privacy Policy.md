Purpose and who we are

The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to describe how Coursera, Inc. ("Coursera," "us," "we," or "our") collects, uses and shares information about you through our online interfaces (e.g., websites and mobile applications) owned and controlled by us, including www.coursera.org (collectively referred to herein as the "Site"). Please read this notice carefully to understand what we do. If you do not understand any aspects of our Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us at privacy@coursera.org. Your use of our Site is also governed by our Terms of Use.

Coursera, Inc. is a Delaware corporation with a principal place of business at 381 E. Evelyn Ave., Mountain View, CA 94041. If you reside or are located in the European Economic Area ("EEA") Coursera is the data controller of all Personally Identifiable Information (as defined below) collected via the Site and of certain Personally Identifiable Information collected from third parties, as set out in this Privacy Policy.

What Information this Privacy Policy Covers

This Privacy Policy covers information we collect from you through our Site. Some of our Site’s functionality can be used without revealing any Personally Identifiable Information, though for features or services related to the Online Courses, Personally Identifiable Information is required. In order to access certain features and benefits on our Site, you may need to submit, or we may collect, 

**"Personally Identifiable Information"** (i.e., information that can be used to identify you). Personally Identifiable Information can include information such as your name and email address, among other things. If you reside or are located in the EEA, it can also include your IP address or device identifier. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the Personally Identifiable Information you submit to Coursera. Inaccurate information may affect your ability to use the Site, the information you receive when using the Site, and our ability to contact you. For example, your email address should be kept current because that is one of the primary manners in which we communicate with you.What You Agree to by Using Our Site

We consider that the legal bases for using your personal information as set out in this privacy policy are as follows:

*   our use of your personal information is necessary to perform our obligations under any contract with you (for example, to comply with the terms of use of our Site which you accept by browsing our website and/or to comply with our contract to provide services to you). or
*   our use of your personal information is necessary for complying with our legal obligations. or
*   where neither of the above apply, use of your personal information is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others. Our legitimate interests are to:
    *   run, grow and develop our business;
    *   operate our Site and provide our services;
    *   select appropriately skilled and qualified suppliers;
    *   build relationships with partners and academic institutions;
    *   carry out research and statistical analysis;
    *   carry out marketing and business development. and
    *   for internal administrative and auditing purposes.

If we rely on our (or another person's) legitimate interests for using your personal information, we will undertake a balancing test to ensure that our (or the other person's) legitimate interests are not outweighed by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection of the personal information.

We may process your personal information in some cases for marketing purposes on the basis of your consent (which you may withdraw at any time after giving it, as described below).

If we rely on your consent for us to use your personal information in a particular way, but you later change your mind, you may withdraw your consent by visiting your profile page and clicking the box to remove consent or delete your account and we will stop doing so. However, if you withdraw your consent, this may impact the ability for us to be able to provide our services to you.

Privacy Shield Policy

_Effective as of June 28, 2017._

Introduction.

Coursera, Inc. (referred to as "we," "us," or "our"), believes in protecting your privacy.

We participate in and commit to adhering to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework which includes the Privacy Shield Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access and enforcement (the "Principles") for all transfers of personal data from EEA to the U.S. To learn more about Privacy Shield, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce Privacy Shield website: https://www.privacyshield.gov/. For more information regarding our Privacy Shield certification, please click here.

When we use the term "Personal Information" in this Privacy Shield Policy, we are referring to any information that (i) is recorded in any form. (ii) is about an identified or identifiable individual. and (iii) is received by us from the EEA.

When we use the term "Sensitive Personal Information" in this Privacy Shield Policy, we are referring to a particular subset of an individual’s Personal Information that provides details of his or her race, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership or that concerns his or her health.

The purpose of this Privacy Shield Policy is to outline our general practices for implementing the Principles with respect to the Personal Information we collect. If you would like to obtain additional information regarding our privacy practices in connection with information collected on this website in general, please refer to our online Privacy Policy.

Principles.

**1\. Notice.** We will provide you with timely and appropriate notice in our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, describing what Personal Information we are collecting, how we will use that information, and the types of third parties with whom we may share such information (and the reasons we do so). Please review these documents carefully. Where we process personal data on behalf of our business partners, we will work with them to help them provide appropriate notice to you.

**2\. Choice.** We will offer you the opportunity to opt-out of your Personal Information (or to provide explicit consent for Sensitive Personal Information) being: (i) disclosed to a third party (other than a service provider as set forth below). or (ii) used for a purpose materially different from the purpose for which it was originally collected (as set out in our Privacy Policy), or subsequently authorized by you, when the circumstances arise. You also have the ability to opt out at any time from the use of your personal information for direct marketing purposes. To exercise this right, please check your settings options. If you have further questions related to the above, you can also contact us at privacyshield@coursera.org.

Where we process personal data on behalf of our business partners, we will work with them to ensure you are offered appropriate choices (and means to exercise those choices) for limiting use or disclosure of your personal data (where appropriate).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that we may disclose Personal Information under the following circumstances without offering you an opportunity to opt out of such disclosure: (i) to our partner institutions and other service providers that we have retained to perform requested services on our behalf. (ii) if we are required to do so by law or legal process. (iii) pursuant to valid requests by law enforcement or other government authorities (which we are legally required to respond to). and (iv) when we believe disclosure is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity. In addition, we reserve the right to transfer Personal Information in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or liquidation). Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use the Personal Information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Shield Policy.

**3\. Onward Transfers (Transfer to Third Parties).** We will only transfer Personal Information to third parties where the third party: (i) has provided satisfactory assurances to us that it will protect the Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Shield Policy and the Principles. (ii) is located in the EU or a country considered "adequate" for privacy by the EU Commission, and therefore is required to comply with the EU data protection laws or substantially equivalent privacy laws. or (iii) has certified to Privacy Shield, and is independently responsible for complying with the Principles.

Where we have knowledge that a third party to whom we have provided Personal Information is processing that Personal Information in a manner contrary to this Privacy Shield Policy or the Principles, we will take reasonable steps to prevent or terminate processing by the third party until such time the third party can process Personal Information in compliance with this Privacy Shield Policy and the Principles. Under certain circumstances, we may be potentially liable if these requirements are not met.

**4\. Data Security.** We will take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. We have implemented appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to help safeguard and secure Personal Information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction.

**5\. Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation.** We will process Personal Information in a manner that is compatible with and relevant to the purpose for which it was collected or authorized by you. To the extent necessary for those purposes, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Information is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.

**6\. Access.** Upon request, we will provide you with reasonable access to the Personal Information about you that we hold. We will also take reasonable steps to correct, update, amend or delete any information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate, except where the burden or expense of doing so would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy in the case in question or where the rights of third parties would be violated. Where we process personal data on behalf of our business partners, we will work with them in complying with such requests in accordance with applicable law.

**7\. Recourse. Enforcement.** We will regularly review our compliance with the statements set forth in this Privacy Shield Policy, and we will provide an independent way to resolve complaints about our privacy practices. We encourage interested persons to first contact us (contact information provided below) and we will investigate and attempt to resolve any complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of Personal Information in accordance with the Principles. If your inquiry is not satisfactorily addressed by us, we have registered with the International Centre for Dispute Resolution ("ICDR"), a division of the American Arbitration Association, to provide independent third party dispute resolution (free of charge) to you. To contact ICDR and/or learn more about the company’s dispute resolution services, including complaint submission, please visit: http://go.adr.org/privacyshield.html. There may also be circumstances when disputes can be resolved through the Privacy Shield binding arbitration process. Please see the Privacy Shield website for further information: https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=C-Pre-Arbitration-Requirements.

**8\. Jurisdiction.** As part of our participation in Privacy Shield, we are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and other authorized statutory bodies.

Modifications.

We may amend this Privacy Shield Policy from time-to-time in accordance with the requirements of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. The most recent version of the Privacy Shield Policy will always be posted to this website. Anytime that we do make such changes, we will also update the effective date listed at the bottom of the Privacy Shield Policy. Please be sure to review the most recent version of the Privacy Shield Policy each time that you visit this website so that you are aware of how we collect, use and retain personal information.
