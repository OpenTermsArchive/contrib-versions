* * *

_Effective: March 1, 2024._

Key Information
---------------

You can find information about us and how we collect, use and store your personal data in each section of this Privacy Notice:

Purpose and who we are
----------------------

The purpose of this Privacy Notice is to describe how Coursera, Inc., our subsidiaries, and our international branches, ("Coursera," "us," "we," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information about you through our online interfaces (e.g., websites and mobile applications) owned and controlled by us, including but not limited to coursera.org and rhyme.com (collectively referred to herein as the "Site"). Please read this Privacy Notice carefully to understand what we do. If you do not understand any aspects of our Privacy Notice, please feel free to contact us at [privacy@coursera.org](mailto:privacy@coursera.org). Your use of our Site is also governed by our [Terms of Use](https://www.coursera.org/about/terms).Terms used but not defined in this Privacy Notice can be found in our Terms of Use. Coursera, Inc. is a Delaware corporation with a principal place of business at 381 E. Evelyn Ave., Mountain View, CA 94041. If you reside or are located in the European Economic Area ("EEA") Coursera is the data controller of all Personal Data (as defined below) collected via the Site and of certain Personal Data collected from third parties, as set out in this Privacy Notice unless you are part of a degree, certain MasterTrack programs, or certain other circumstances as communicated to you, in which case Coursera is the data processor.

What Information this Privacy Notice Covers
-------------------------------------------

This Privacy Notice covers information we collect from you through our Site. Some of our Site’s functionality can be used without revealing any Personal Data, but for features or Services related to the Content Offerings, Personal Data is required. In order to access certain features and benefits on our Site, you may need to submit, or we may collect, **"Personal Data"** (i.e., information that can be used to identify you and which may also be referred to as “personally identifiable information” or “personal information”). Personal Data can include information such as your name, email address, IP address, and device identifier, among other things. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the Personal Data you submit to Coursera. Inaccurate information may affect your ability to use the Site, the information you receive when using the Site, and our ability to contact you. For example, your email address should be kept current because that is one of the primary manners in which we communicate with you.

Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Personal Data
--------------------------------------------------

We consider that the legal bases for using your Personal Data as set out in this Privacy Notice are as follows:

Which legal basis applies to a specific activity will depend on the type of personal information used and the context in which it is being used.

If we rely on our (or another party’s) legitimate interests for using your personal information, we will undertake a balancing test to ensure that our (or the other party’s) legitimate interests are not outweighed by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection of the personal information.

We may process your personal information in some cases for marketing purposes on the basis of your consent (which you may withdraw at any time as described below).

If we rely on your consent for us to use your personal information in a particular way, but you later change your mind, you may withdraw your consent by visiting your profile page and clicking the box to remove consent and we will stop doing so. If you withdraw your consent, this may impact the ability for us to provide some of our Services to you.

What Personal Data We Collect
-----------------------------

We gather the following types of information about users through the Site:

1. **Information relating to your use of our Site.** When users come to our Site, we may track, collect, and aggregate information indicating, among other things, which pages of our Site were visited, the order in which they were visited, when they were visited, and which hyperlinks were clicked. We also collect information from the URLs from which you linked to our Site. Collecting such information may involve logging the IP address, operating system, and browser software used by each user of the Site. We may be able to determine from an IP address a user’s Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of their point of connectivity. Location data may be used to route your traffic to the nearest regional server to reduce latency and improve your experience. We may also use cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies when you visit our Site. For more information on our use of cookies and web beacons, please refer to our [Cookies Policy](https://www.coursera.org/about/cookies).
    
2. **Personal Data provided directly by you or via third parties.** We collect Personal Data that you provide to us when you register for an account, update or change information for your account, purchase products or Services, complete a survey, sign-up for email updates, participate in our public forums, send us email messages, and/or participate in Content Offerings or other Services on our Site. We may use the Personal Data that you provide to respond to your questions, provide you the specific Content Offering and/or Services you select, send you updates about Content Offerings or other Coursera events, and send you email messages about Site maintenance or updates.

If you participate in a Content Offering, we may collect certain user-generated content, such as assignments you submit, peer-graded assignments, and peer grading feedback. We also collect course data, such as responses to in-video quizzes, standalone quizzes, exams, and surveys. You should not include any Personal Data or other information of a personal or sensitive nature, whether relating to you or another person, on assignments, exams, or surveys, except for information required to participate in or submit such assignments, exams, or surveys.

* Identity Verification. Coursera may offer you the ability to verify your identity for select Services. In order to enroll for these Services, you may be required to provide us or our third-party identity verification vendor with Personal Data such as your name, address, date of birth, a headshot taken using a webcam, and a photo identification document. Additionally, if you apply for financial aid in connection with these Services, you may be required to provide information regarding your income.
* Communications with Coursera. We may receive and record Personal Data when you send us an email message or otherwise contact us, including through the use of an in-platform messaging/chat feature.
* Third Party Sites. We may receive Personal Data when you access or log-in to a third party site, e.g., Facebook, from our Sites. This may include the text and/or images of your Personal Data available from the third party site.
* Surveys. We may receive Personal Data when you provide information in response to a survey operated by us or a Content Provider.
* Partner sites. Partner sites providing Content Offering-related tools and services to Coursera users may collect nonfinancial individual-level user data regarding the individual’s use of that partner site while the partner sites provide those services to Coursera. The partner sites may share that data with Coursera for the purpose of improving our Services, the partner site’s services, and the individual’s education experience. This data includes information such as the amount of time spent on the partner site and pages viewed.
* Third Party Payment Processing. Coursera provides you with the ability to pay for Content Offerings and other Services using a credit card or other methods through a third party payment processing service provider. Please note that our service provider – not Coursera – collects and processes your financial information.

How We Use Personal Data
------------------------

Coursera collects and uses Personal Data for the purposes described in this section. Coursera may share such Personal Data for these purposes with third parties, such as service providers, university and industry partners, and other commercial partners.

External Links
--------------

For your convenience we may provide links to sites operated by organizations other than Coursera ("Third Party Sites") that we believe may be of interest to you. We do not disclose your Personal Data to these Third Party Sites unless we have a lawful basis on which to do so. We do not endorse and are not responsible for the privacy practices of these Third Party Sites. If you choose to click on a link to one of these Third Party Sites, you should review the privacy policy posted on the other site to understand how that Third Party Site collects and uses your Personal Data.

Retention of Personal Data
--------------------------

We keep your Personal Data for no longer than necessary for the purposes for which the Personal Data is collected and processed. The length of time we retain Personal Data for depends on the purposes for which we collect and use it and/or as required to comply with applicable laws and to establish, exercise, or defend our legal rights.

Confidentiality & Security of Personal Data
-------------------------------------------

We will use industry standard physical, technical, and administrative security measures to keep your Personal Data confidential and secure, and will not share it with third parties, except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Notice, or unless such disclosure is necessary in special cases, such as a physical threat to you or others, as permitted by applicable law. Because the Internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot guarantee the security of Personal Data, and there is some risk that an unauthorized third party may find a way to circumvent our security systems or that transmission of your information over the Internet will be intercepted. It is your responsibility to protect the security of your login information. Please note that e-mail communications are typically not encrypted and should not be considered secure.

Your Rights
-----------

You have certain rights in relation to your Personal Data. You can access your Personal Data and confirm that it remains correct and up-to-date, choose whether or not you wish to receive material from us or some of our partners, and request that we delete or provide you with a copy of your Personal Data by logging into the Site, selecting ‘Settings’ from the dropdown in the top right, and scrolling down to find the appropriate option. The ability to delete an account may be disabled for some users, particularly those who are enrolled in for-credit offerings such as degrees, MasterTrack certificate programs, and other similar offerings.

If you would like further information in relation to your rights or would like to exercise any of them, you may also contact us via [privacy@coursera.org](mailto:privacy@coursera.org). If you reside or are located in the EEA, United Kingdom, Switzerland, or other region that offers similar protections, you have the right to request that we:

We try to answer every request promptly where possible, and provide our response within the time period stated by applicable law. Keep in mind, however, that when deleting your Personal Data there may be residual information that will remain within our databases, access logs, and other records, which may or may not contain your Personal Data. Please also note that certain Personal Data may be exempt from such requests in certain circumstances, which may include if we need to retain your Personal Data to comply with a legal obligation. When you email us with a request, we may ask that you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity.

Our Site is primarily operated and managed on servers located and operated within the United States.

We are committed to protecting Personal Data when it is transferred. If you reside or are located within the EEA, United Kingdom, Switzerland (or other region that offers similar protections) and such data transfers occur, we take appropriate steps to ensure an equivalent level of protection for your Personal Data. We participate in and commit to adhering to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, or the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework when transferring data from the EEA, UK or Switzerland to the United States.

Data Privacy Framework (DPF) Notice
===================================

* * *

_Effective as of January 1, 2024._

Introduction.
-------------

Coursera, Inc. (referred to as "we," "us," or "our"), believes in protecting your privacy. This DPF Notice contains supplementary information relating to Personal Data transferred on the basis of the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, or the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. This DPF Notice should be read in conjunction with Coursera’s [Privacy Notice](https://www.coursera.org/about/privacy), which provides details of the Personal Data processed, purposes for which Personal Data is collected, processed and disclosed, types of third parties to which Personal Data is disclosed, and rights of individuals. To the extent of any conflict between this DPF Notice and Coursera’s Privacy Notice, this DPF Notice prevails.

We participate in and commit to adhering to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (together the “DPF”) which includes the DPF Principles of notice, choice, accountability for onward transfer, security, data integrity and purpose limitation, access, and recourse, enforcement and liability (the "Principles") for transfers of Personal Data from the EEA, UK and Switzerland, respectively, to the U.S. To learn more about the DPF, please visit the DPF website: [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/). For more information regarding our DPF certification, please click [here](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/participant-search/participant-detail?id=a2zt000000001EEAAY&status=Active) or search for ‘Coursera’ in the DPF list of participants.

Your Choices
------------

We will offer you the opportunity to opt-out of your Personal Data (or to provide explicit consent for Sensitive Personal Data) being: (i) disclosed to a third party (other than an agent performing tasks on behalf of and under the instructions of Coursera) ); or (ii) used for a purpose materially different from the purpose for which it was originally collected (as set out in our Privacy Notice), or subsequently authorized by you, when the circumstances arise. You also have the ability to opt out at any time from the use of your Personal Data for direct marketing and certain uses of tracking technologies purposes. To exercise this right, please check your account and cookie settings. If you have further questions related to the above, you can also contact us at [privacy@coursera.org](mailto:privacy@coursera.org).

Recourse, Enforcement and Liability
-----------------------------------

We will regularly review our compliance with the statements set forth in this DPF Notice, and we will provide an independent way to resolve complaints about our privacy practices. We encourage interested persons to first contact us (contact information provided below) and we will investigate and attempt to resolve any complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of Personal Data in accordance with the Principles. If your enquiry is not satisfactorily addressed by us, we have registered with the International Centre for Dispute Resolution ("ICDR"), a division of the American Arbitration Association, to provide independent third party dispute resolution (free of charge) to you. To contact ICDR and/or learn more about the company’s dispute resolution services, including complaint submission, please visit: [https://go.adr.org/dpf\_irm.html](http://go.adr.org/privacyshield.html). There may also be circumstances when disputes can be resolved through the DPF binding arbitration process. Please see the [DPF website for further information](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/My-Rights-under-the-Data-Privacy-Framework-DPF-Program-dpf). For residents of Switzerland, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner’s authority will replace that of the EU bodies. For residents of the United Kingdom, the Information Commissioner’s Office will serve this role.

In the context of an onward transfer, Coursera has responsibility for the processing of Personal Data it receives under the DPF and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Coursera shall remain liable under the Principles if its agent processes such Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless Coursera proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

Jurisdiction
------------

As part of our participation in DPF, we are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and other authorized statutory bodies.

Modifications
-------------

We may amend this DPF Notice from time-to-time in accordance with the requirements of the DPF or a successor data transfer framework. The most recent version of the DPF Notice will always be posted to this website. Anytime that we do make such changes, we will also update the effective date listed at the top of the DPF Notice. Please be sure to review the most recent version of the DPF Notice each time that you visit this website so that you are aware of how we collect, use, and retain Personal Data.
