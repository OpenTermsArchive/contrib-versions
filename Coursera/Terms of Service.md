Refund Policy

_Effective as of January 1, 2020._

For details on our refund deadlines and policies, please refer to the information below. Please note that our policies differ between subscription payments and one-time payments made for course, Specialization, and guided project purchases, and that payment options may vary from one Service to another. Please also note that we treat violations of our Terms of Use and Honor Code very seriously, and we have no obligation to offer refunds to users who violate these terms, even if their requests are made within the designated refund period. Similarly, we have no obligation to offer late refunds to users who do not receive a passing mark in the Content Offering, or who are otherwise unsatisfied with their final grade.

For more information about our refund process, including instructions for requesting a refund, please visit our Learner Help Center.

For Month-to-Month Subscriptions

Coursera does not offer refunds for payments made on a month-month subscription plan. To avoid being charged during a free trial promotion, you must cancel your subscription before your 7-day free trial ends. If you complete a course during the free trial period, Coursera reserves the right to require you to pay for a one-month subscription in order to receive a Course and/or Specialization Certificate.

Your subscription will continue on a month-to-month basis unless and until you cancel or the subscription is suspended or discontinued by Coursera. For subscriptions to individual Specializations, Coursera will automatically discontinue your subscription at the end of the monthly period during which you earn a Specialization Certificate for the Specialization, unless you have subscribed through a third party marketplace that restricts Coursera's ability to do so -- e.g., in-app purchases through the Apple App Store. Please visit the third party marketplace for information regarding their policies. You must cancel your subscription before your monthly renewal date to avoid the next billing.

If you cancel your subscription, cancellation will be effective at the end of the current monthly period. you will have continued access to your subscription for the remainder of that period, but you will not receive a refund.

For Coursera Plus

To get a full refund of your Coursera Plus subscription payment, submit a refund request via the Learner Help Center within 14 days of your payment. Refunds will not be provided if requested after this 14-day period.

Your Coursera Plus subscription will continue for the subscription period identified at the time of your purchase and then automatically renew unless and until you cancel your subscription or the subscription is suspended or discontinued by Coursera.

If you cancel your subscription after the first 14 days of your subscription period, you will continue to have access until the end of the subscription period and will not be billed for the next billing cycle.

For One-time Course and Specialization Purchases

If you cancel your paid enrollment for a standalone course, Coursera will offer you a complete refund until 14 days after payment, or until you have earned your Course Certificate, whichever is earlier. If you pre-enroll and pay for a course, Coursera will offer you a complete refund until 14 days after the course launches or until you have earned your Course Certificate, whichever is earlier. For avoidance doubt, once you have earned a Course Certificate with your payment, you are not eligible for a refund even if it is within 14 days. If you do not earn your Course Certificate within 180 days, your registration will expire and you will need to pay to re-enroll for the course. However, if you’re taking a course through your company or organization (e.g. Coursera for Business, Coursera for Governments or Organizations, Coursera for Refugees, or other Coursera Social Good programs ) then you can earn your certificate as long as your company's contract with Coursera is active and your access has not expired in accordance with the terms of that contract. Similarly, refunds and cancellations will also be governed by the terms of that contract between your organization and Coursera.

If you cancel your one-time, paid enrollment for a Specialization, Coursera will offer you a complete refund until 14 days after payment, or until you earn a Course Certificate for any course in the Specialization, whichever is earlier. If you pre-enroll and pay for the Specialization, Coursera will offer you a complete refund until 14 days after the first course in the Specialization launches or until you have earned your first Course Certificate for any course in the Specialization, whichever is earlier. If you earned your first Course Certificate for any course in the Specialization within 14 days, you are not eligible for a refund. Unless otherwise indicated as part of the sign-up process, you have one year after you purchase a Specialization to complete the Specialization.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, shorter refund periods may apply to specific courses and Specializations (e.g., for courses that are part of the UCI Professional Certificate in Applied Project Management, you will only be eligible for a full refund until seven days after your payment date). In these cases, the shorter period will be stated as part of the sign-up process for the course or Specialization.

For Guided Projects

Coursera does not offer refunds for payments made for guided projects. If you do not earn your completion certificate within 180 days after registering for a guided project, your registration will expire and you will need to pay to re-enroll for the guided project in order to complete the guided project and earn your completion certificate. However, if you’re taking a course through your company or organization (e.g. Coursera for Business, Coursera for Governments or Organizations, Coursera for Refugees, or other Coursera Social Good programs) then you can earn your certificate as long as your company's contract with Coursera is active and your access has not expired in accordance with the terms of that contract. Similarly, refunds and cancellations will also be governed by the terms of that contract between your organization and Coursera. If you have subscribed through a third party marketplace that restricts Coursera's ability to issue refunds -- e.g., in-app purchases through the Apple App Store, please visit the third party marketplace for information regarding their policies.

For Degree and MasterTrack Certificate Programs

Refund policies for degree and MasterTrack certificate programs are established and administered by the university partner offering the program. Refund policies are communicated to students by Coursera’s university partners.

For Other Paid Services

Except as described in this Refund Policy or as explicitly stated as part of the sign-up process for a Service, Coursera has no obligation to provide refunds or vouchers for any other Services.

Third Party Marketplaces

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you purchase or subscribe for a course, Specialization, guided project, or purchase any other paid Service, through a third party marketplace (e.g., in-app purchases through the Apple App Store or purchases made through certain alternative payment services), the refund policy applicable to that third party marketplace will apply, unless otherwise explicitly stated by Coursera. Except as otherwise explicitly stated by Coursera, the third party marketplace will be solely responsible for making refunds under its refund policy, and Coursera will have no refund obligations. Coursera disclaims any responsibility or liability related to any third party marketplace's refund policy or the third party's compliance or noncompliance with such policy.

Honor Code

_Effective as of January 1, 2020_

All students participating in the class must agree to abide by the following code:

1.  I will register for only one account, unless expressly permitted to register for additional accounts by Coursera.
2.  My answers to homework, quizzes, exams, projects, and other assignments will be my own work (except for assignments that explicitly permit collaboration).
3.  I will not make solutions to homework, quizzes, exams, projects, and other assignments available to anyone else (except to the extent an assignment explicitly permits sharing solutions). This includes both solutions written by me, as well as any solutions provided by the course staff or others.
