Copyright and Trademark Policy
==============================

* * *

_Effective as of January 1, 2020._

Coursera respects the intellectual property rights of our Content Providers, instructors, and other third parties and expects our users to do the same when using the Services. We reserve the right to suspend, disable, or terminate the accounts of users who repeatedly infringe or are repeatedly charged with infringing the copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights of others.

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you would like to read the DMCA, please visit the U.S. Copyright Office website at [http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf](http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf).

If you believe in good faith that materials on the Services infringe your copyright, the DMCA provides that you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed or access to it blocked.

The notice must include the following information:

1.  the physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
2.  identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or, if multiple copyrighted works located on the Services are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works);
3.  identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Coursera to locate the material on the Services;
4.  the name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available) of the complaining party;
5.  a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
6.  a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA. Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Services can either be sent:

1.  via mail: Copyright Agent, Coursera 381 E. Evelyn Ave Mountain View, CA 94041
2.  via email: [copyright@coursera.org](mailto:copyright@coursera.org)

We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice. Also, be aware that there can be penalties for false claims under the DMCA.

Coursera also respects the trademark rights of others. Accounts with any other content that misleads others or violates another's trademark may be updated, suspended, disabled, or terminated by Coursera in its sole discretion. If you are concerned that someone may be using your trademark in an infringing way on our Services, please email us at [copyright@coursera.org](mailto:copyright@coursera.org), and we will review your complaint. If we deem appropriate, we may remove the offending content, warn the individual who posted the content, and/or temporarily or permanently suspend or disable the individual’s account.

Refund Policy
=============

* * *

_Effective as of January 1, 2020._

For details on our refund deadlines and policies, please refer to the information below. Please note that our policies differ between subscription payments and one-time payments made for course, Specialization, and guided project purchases, and that payment options may vary from one Service to another. Please also note that we treat violations of our Terms of Use and Honor Code very seriously, and we have no obligation to offer refunds to users who violate these terms, even if their requests are made within the designated refund period. Similarly, we have no obligation to offer late refunds to users who do not receive a passing mark in the Content Offering, or who are otherwise unsatisfied with their final grade.

For more information about our refund process, including instructions for requesting a refund, please visit our [Learner Help Center](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/articles/208280266).

For Month-to-Month Subscriptions
--------------------------------

Coursera does not offer refunds for payments made on a month-month subscription plan. To avoid being charged during a free trial promotion, you must cancel your subscription before your 7-day free trial ends. If you complete a course during the free trial period, Coursera reserves the right to require you to pay for a one-month subscription in order to receive a Course and/or Specialization Certificate.

Your subscription will continue on a month-to-month basis unless and until you [cancel](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/articles/216348123) or the subscription is suspended or discontinued by Coursera. For subscriptions to individual Specializations, Coursera will automatically discontinue your subscription at the end of the monthly period during which you earn a Specialization Certificate for the Specialization, unless you have subscribed through a third party marketplace that restricts Coursera's ability to do so -- e.g., in-app purchases through the Apple App Store. Please visit the third party marketplace for information regarding their policies. You must cancel your subscription before your monthly renewal date to avoid the next billing.

If you cancel your subscription, cancellation will be effective at the end of the current monthly period; you will have continued access to your subscription for the remainder of that period, but you will not receive a refund.

For Coursera Plus
-----------------

To get a full refund of your Coursera Plus subscription payment, submit a refund request via the [Learner Help Center](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/208280266-Refund-policies) within 14 days of your payment. Refunds will not be provided if requested after this 14-day period. Some Coursera Plus subscriptions may have a free trial period instead of a refund period. If you do not cancel during the free trial, you will be billed the full amount for the subscription you signed up for and be unable to request a refund.

Your Coursera Plus subscription will continue for the subscription period identified at the time of your purchase and then automatically renew unless and until you cancel your subscription or the subscription is suspended or discontinued by Coursera.

If you cancel your subscription after the first 14 days of your subscription period, you will continue to have access until the end of the subscription period and will not be billed for the next billing cycle.

For One-time Course and Specialization Purchases
------------------------------------------------

If you cancel your paid enrollment for a standalone course, Coursera will offer you a complete refund until 14 days after payment, or until you have earned your Course Certificate, whichever is earlier. If you [pre-enroll and pay for a course](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/articles/209818603), Coursera will offer you a complete refund until 14 days after the course launches or until you have earned your Course Certificate, whichever is earlier. For avoidance doubt, once you have earned a Course Certificate with your payment, you are not eligible for a refund even if it is within 14 days. If you do not earn your Course Certificate within 180 days, your registration will expire and you will need to pay to re-enroll for the course. However, if you’re taking a course through your company or organization (e.g. Coursera for Business, Coursera for Governments or Organizations, Coursera for Refugees, or other Coursera Social Good programs ) then you can earn your certificate as long as your company's contract with Coursera is active and your access has not expired in accordance with the terms of that contract. Similarly, refunds and cancellations will also be governed by the terms of that contract between your organization and Coursera.

If you cancel your one-time, paid enrollment for a Specialization, Coursera will offer you a complete refund until 14 days after payment, or until you earn a Course Certificate for any course in the Specialization, whichever is earlier. If you [pre-enroll and pay for the Specialization](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/articles/209818603), Coursera will offer you a complete refund until 14 days after the first course in the Specialization launches or until you have earned your first Course Certificate for any course in the Specialization, whichever is earlier. If you earned your first Course Certificate for any course in the Specialization within 14 days, you are not eligible for a refund. Unless otherwise indicated as part of the sign-up process, you have one year after you purchase a Specialization to complete the Specialization.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, shorter refund periods may apply to specific courses and Specializations (e.g., for courses that are part of the UCI Professional Certificate in Applied Project Management, you will only be eligible for a full refund until seven days after your payment date). In these cases, the shorter period will be stated as part of the sign-up process for the course or Specialization.

For Guided Projects
-------------------

Coursera does not offer refunds for payments made for guided projects. If you do not earn your completion certificate within 180 days after registering for a guided project, your registration will expire and you will need to pay to re-enroll for the guided project in order to complete the guided project and earn your completion certificate. However, if you’re taking a course through your company or organization (e.g. Coursera for Business, Coursera for Governments or Organizations, Coursera for Refugees, or other Coursera Social Good programs) then you can earn your certificate as long as your company's contract with Coursera is active and your access has not expired in accordance with the terms of that contract. Similarly, refunds and cancellations will also be governed by the terms of that contract between your organization and Coursera. If you have subscribed through a third party marketplace that restricts Coursera's ability to issue refunds -- e.g., in-app purchases through the Apple App Store, please visit the third party marketplace for information regarding their policies.

For Degree and MasterTrack Certificate Programs
-----------------------------------------------

Refund policies for degree and MasterTrack certificate programs are established and administered by the university partner offering the program. Refund policies are communicated to students by Coursera’s university partners.

For Other Paid Services
-----------------------

Except as described in this Refund Policy or as explicitly stated as part of the sign-up process for a Service, Coursera has no obligation to provide refunds or vouchers for any other Services.

Third Party Marketplaces
------------------------

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you purchase or subscribe for a course, Specialization, guided project, or purchase any other paid Service, through a third party marketplace (e.g., in-app purchases through the Apple App Store or purchases made through certain alternative payment services), the refund policy applicable to that third party marketplace will apply, unless otherwise explicitly stated by Coursera. Except as otherwise explicitly stated by Coursera, the third party marketplace will be solely responsible for making refunds under its refund policy, and Coursera will have no refund obligations. Coursera disclaims any responsibility or liability related to any third party marketplace's refund policy or the third party's compliance or noncompliance with such policy.

* * *

Honor Code
==========

* * *

1.  I will register for only one account, unless expressly permitted to register for additional accounts by Coursera.
