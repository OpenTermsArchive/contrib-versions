Governing Law and Venue
-----------------------

The Services are managed by Coursera, which is located in Santa Clara County, California. You agree that any dispute related to these Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflicts of law provisions. In the event of any dispute related to these Terms that is not subject to binding arbitration, you and Coursera will submit to the personal jurisdiction of and exclusive venue in the federal and state courts located in and serving Santa Clara County, California as the legal forum for any such dispute.

Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver
-------------------------------------------

You and Coursera agree to submit to binding arbitration any and all disputes, claims, or controversies of any kind, whether based on statute, regulation, constitution, common law, equity, or any other legal basis or theory, and whether pre-existing, present, or future, that arise out of or relate to our Services, these Terms, and/or any other relationship or dispute between you and us, including without limitation (i) the scope, applicability, or enforceability of these Terms and/or this arbitration provision, and (ii) relationships with third parties who are not parties to these Terms or this arbitration provision to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law (each a “Claim,” and collectively the “Claims”).

Any and all Claims shall be submitted for binding arbitration in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA Rules”), as amended, in effect at the time arbitration is initiated. The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org or by calling (800) 778-7879, and are hereby incorporated by reference. In the event of any inconsistency between this arbitration provision and the AAA Rules, such inconsistency shall be resolved in favor of this provision. If you decide to initiate arbitration, you agree to pay the initiation fee of $200 (or the amount otherwise required by the AAA Rules), and we agree to pay the remaining arbitration initiation fee and any additional deposit required by AAA to initiate your arbitration. We will pay the costs of the arbitration proceeding, including the arbitrator’s fees; however, other fees, such as attorney’s fees and expenses of travel to the arbitration, shall be paid in accordance with the AAA Rules and applicable law. We will pay all costs associated with any arbitration that we commence. A single, neutral arbitrator selected in accordance with the AAA Rules shall decide all Claims.

The arbitrator shall be an active member in good standing of the bar for any state in the continental United States and shall be either actively engaged in the practice of law for at least five years or a retired judge. The arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law. Unless inconsistent with applicable law, and except as otherwise provided herein, each party shall bear the expense of its respective attorney, expert, and witness fees, regardless of which party prevails in the arbitration. Any arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in the federal judicial district of your residence, and you will be given the opportunity to attend the proceeding and be heard. The arbitrator’s decision will be final and binding upon the parties and may be enforced in any federal or state court that has jurisdiction. You and we agree that the arbitration shall be kept confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element of it (including, without limitation, any pleadings, briefs or other documents submitted or exchanged and any testimony or other oral submissions and awards) will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings, except as may lawfully be required in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration or by applicable disclosure rules and regulations of governmental agencies.

Neither you nor Coursera may act as a class representative, nor participate as a member of a class of claimants, with respect to any Claim. The Claims may not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis. The arbitrator can decide only your and/or Coursera individual Claims. The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated. Accordingly, you and we agree that the AAA Supplementary Rules for Class Arbitrations do not apply to our arbitration. This arbitration provision and the procedures applicable to the arbitration contemplated by this provision are governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, notwithstanding any state law that may be applicable.

This arbitration agreement does not preclude you or us from seeking action by federal, state, or local government agencies. You and we also have the right to exercise self-help remedies, such as set-off, or to bring qualifying claims in small claims court so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. In addition, you and we retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional or ancillary relief, including pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with any of these Terms, nor a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided in this provision.

A court may sever any portion of this Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver Section that it finds to be unenforceable, except for the prohibitions on any Claim being handled on a class or representative basis, and the remaining portions of this arbitration provision will remain valid and enforceable. No waiver of any provision of this Section will be effective or enforceable unless recorded in a writing signed by the party waiving such a right or requirement. Such a waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of these Terms.

THIS BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION, THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM, AND THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THE AAA RULES. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU OR COURSERA WOULD HAVE IN COURT ALSO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.

General Terms
-------------

We reserve the right to revise the Terms at our sole discretion at any time. Any revisions to the Terms will be effective immediately upon posting by us. For any material changes to the Terms, we will take reasonable steps to notify you of such changes, via a banner on the website, email notification, another method, or combination of methods. In all cases, your continued use of the Services after publication of such changes, with or without notification, constitutes binding acceptance of the revised Terms.

#### Severability; Waiver

If it turns out that a particular provision of these Terms is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms. If you do not comply with these Terms, and we do not take immediate action, this does not indicate that we relinquish any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).

#### Content Providers

Our Content Providers and integrated service providers are third party beneficiaries of the Terms and may enforce those provisions of the Terms that relate to them.

Copyright and Trademark Policy
==============================

* * *

_Effective as of January 1, 2021._

Coursera respects the intellectual property rights of our Content Providers, instructors, users, and other third parties and expects our users to do the same when using the Services. We reserve the right to suspend, disable, or terminate the accounts of users who repeatedly infringe or are repeatedly charged with infringing the copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights of others.

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you would like to read the DMCA, please visit the U.S. Copyright Office website at [http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf](http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf).

If you believe in good faith that materials on the Coursera platform infringe your copyright, the DMCA provides that you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed or access to it blocked.

The notice must include the following information:

1.  the physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
2.  identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or, if multiple copyrighted works located on the platform are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works);
3.  identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Coursera to locate the material on the platform;
4.  the name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available) of the complaining party;
5.  a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
6.  a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA. Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Services can either be sent:

1.  via mail: Copyright Agent, Coursera 381 E. Evelyn Ave Mountain View, CA 94041
2.  via email: [copyright@coursera.org](mailto:copyright@coursera.org)

We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice. Also, be aware that there can be penalties for false claims under the DMCA.

Coursera also respects the trademark rights of others. Accounts with any other content that misleads others or violates another's trademark may be updated, suspended, disabled, or terminated by Coursera in its sole discretion. If you are concerned that someone may be using your trademark without proper permission on our Services, please email us at [copyright@coursera.org](mailto:copyright@coursera.org), and we will review your submission. If we deem appropriate, we may remove the offending content, warn the individual who posted the content, and/or temporarily or permanently suspend or disable the individual’s account.

Refund Policy
=============

* * *

_Effective as of January 1, 2021._

For details on our refund deadlines and policies, please refer to the information below. Please note that our policies differ between subscription payments and one-time payments made for course, specialization, and guided project purchases, and that payment options may vary from one offering to another. Please also note that we treat violations of our Terms of Use and Honor Code very seriously, and we have no obligation to offer refunds to users who violate these or other Coursera policies, even if their requests are made within the designated refund period. Similarly, we have no obligation to offer late refunds to users who do not receive a passing mark in a Content Offering, or who are otherwise unsatisfied with their final grade.

For more information about our refund process, including instructions for requesting a refund, please visit our [Learner Help Center](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/articles/208280266).

For Month-to-Month Subscriptions
--------------------------------

Coursera does not offer refunds for payments made on a month-month subscription plan. To avoid being charged during a free trial promotion, you must cancel your subscription before your free trial ends. If you complete a course during the free trial period, Coursera reserves the right to require you to pay for a one-month subscription in order to receive a course and/or specialization certificate.

Your subscription will continue on a month-to-month basis unless and until you [cancel](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/articles/216348123) or the subscription is suspended or discontinued by Coursera. For subscriptions to individual specializations, Coursera will automatically discontinue your subscription at the end of the monthly period during which you earn a specialization certificate for the specialization, unless you have subscribed through a third party marketplace that restricts our ability to do so -- e.g., in-app purchases through the Apple App Store. Please visit the third party marketplace for information regarding their policies. You must cancel your subscription before your monthly renewal date to avoid the next billing.

If you cancel your subscription, cancellation will be effective at the end of the current monthly period; you will continue to have access to your subscription for the remainder of that period, but you will not receive a refund.

For Coursera Plus
-----------------

To get a full refund of your Coursera Plus subscription payment, submit a refund request via the [Learner Help Center](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/208280266-Refund-policies) within 14 days of your payment. Refunds will not be provided if requested after this 14-day period. Some Coursera Plus subscriptions may have a free trial period instead of a refund period. If you do not cancel during the free trial, you will be billed the full amount for the subscription you signed up for and be unable to request a refund.

Your Coursera Plus subscription will continue for the subscription period identified at the time of your purchase and then automatically renew unless and until you cancel your subscription or the subscription is suspended or discontinued by Coursera.

If you cancel your subscription after the refund period of your subscription, you will continue to have access until the end of the subscription period and will not be billed for the next billing cycle.

For One-time Course and Specialization Purchases
------------------------------------------------

If you cancel your paid enrollment for a standalone course, Coursera will offer you a complete refund until 14 days after payment, or until you have earned your course certificate, whichever is earlier. If you [pre-enroll and pay for a course](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/articles/209818603), Coursera will offer you a complete refund until 14 days after the course launches or until you have earned your course certificate, whichever is earlier. For avoidance doubt, once you have earned a course certificate with your payment, you are not eligible for a refund even if it is within 14 days. If you do not earn your course certificate within 180 days, your registration will expire and you will need to pay to re-enroll for the course. However, if you’re taking a course through your company, organization, or a Coursera sponsored program (e.g. Coursera for Business, Coursera for Governments or Organizations, Coursera for Refugees, or other Coursera Social Good programs ) then you can earn your certificate as long as your company's contract with Coursera is active and your access has not expired in accordance with the terms of that contract or Coursera is still running a sponsored program. Similarly, refunds and cancellations will also be governed by the terms of that contract between your organization and Coursera.

If you cancel your one-time, paid enrollment for a specialization, Coursera will offer you a complete refund until 14 days after payment, or until you earn a course certificate for any course in the specialization, whichever is earlier. If you [pre-enroll and pay for the Specialization](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/articles/209818603), Coursera will offer you a complete refund until 14 days after the first course in the specialization launches or until you have earned your first course certificate for any course in the specialization, whichever is earlier. If you earned your first course certificate for any course in the specialization within 14 days, you are not eligible for a refund. Unless otherwise indicated as part of the sign-up process, you have one year after you purchase a specialization to complete the specialization.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, shorter refund periods may apply to specific courses and specializations (e.g., for courses that are part of certain programs, you will only be eligible for a full refund until seven days after your payment date). In these cases, the shorter period will be stated as part of the sign-up process for the course or specialization.

For Guided Projects
-------------------

Coursera does not offer refunds for payments made for guided projects. If you do not earn your completion certificate within 180 days after registering for a guided project, your registration will expire and you will need to pay to re-enroll for the guided project in order to complete the guided project and earn your completion certificate. However, if you’re taking the guided project through your company, organization, or Coursera sponsored program (e.g. Coursera for Business, Coursera for Governments or Organizations, Coursera for Campus, Coursera for Refugees, or other Coursera Social Good programs) then you can earn your certificate as long as your company's contract with Coursera is active and your access and/or invitation has not expired or terminated in accordance with the terms of that contract or Coursera is still running the sponsored program. Similarly, refunds and cancellations will also be governed by the terms of that contract between your organization and Coursera. If you have subscribed through a third party marketplace that restricts our ability to issue refunds -- e.g., in-app purchases through the Apple App Store, please visit the third party marketplace for information regarding their policies.

For Degree and MasterTrack Certificate Programs
-----------------------------------------------

Refund policies for degree and MasterTrack certificate programs are established and administered by the Content Provider offering the program. Refund policies are communicated to students by those Content Providers.

For Other Paid Services
-----------------------

Except as described in this Refund Policy or as explicitly stated as part of the sign-up process for a Service, Coursera has no obligation to provide refunds or vouchers for any other Services.

Third Party Marketplaces
------------------------

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you purchase or subscribe for a course, specialization, guided project, or purchase any other paid Service, through a third party marketplace (e.g., in-app purchases through the Apple App Store or purchases made through certain alternative payment services), the refund policy applicable to that third party marketplace will apply, unless otherwise explicitly stated by Coursera. Except as otherwise explicitly stated by Coursera, the third party marketplace will be solely responsible for making refunds under its refund policy, and Coursera will have no refund obligations. Coursera disclaims any responsibility or liability related to any third party marketplace's refund policy or the third party's compliance or noncompliance with such policy.

* * *

Honor Code
==========

* * *

_Effective as of January 1, 2021_

All users participating in Content Offerings must agree to abide by the following code:

1.  I will register for only one account, unless expressly permitted to register for additional accounts by Coursera.
2.  My answers to homework, quizzes, exams, projects, and other assignments will be my own work (except for assignments that explicitly permit collaboration) as specified in the Coursera [Plagiarism Policy](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code).
3.  I will not make solutions to homework, quizzes, exams, projects, and other assignments available to anyone else (except to the extent an assignment explicitly permits sharing solutions). This includes both solutions written by me, as well as any solutions provided by the course staff or others.
4.  I will not engage in any other activities that will dishonestly improve my results or dishonestly improve or hurt the results of others.

Any violation of this code may result in your access to all or part of the Services being suspended, disabled, or terminated.
