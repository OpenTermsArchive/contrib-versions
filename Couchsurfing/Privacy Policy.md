Couchsurfing.com Privacy Policy
===============================

Effective Date: October **14, 2023**

Please read this Global Privacy Policy (“**Privacy Policy**”) carefully to get a clear understanding of how Couchsurfing International, Inc. (“**Couchsurfing**,” “**we**,” “**us**” or “**our**”) collects, uses, discloses, protects and otherwise handles information about you. Our privacy practices may vary among the countries in which we operate to reflect local practices and legal requirements. In this Privacy Policy, we also provide a supplementary privacy notice for [California residents](#NoticetoCAResidents) and a supplementary privacy notice for data subjects in the [EEA, Switzerland and the UK (collectively, “Europe”)](#NoticeToEuropeanDataSubjects).

### About Couchsurfing

Couchsurfing provides a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in activities and communicate with one another. Couchsurfing connects travelers with a global network of people willing to share in profound and meaningful ways, making travel a truly social experience. We are a community built on trust. A fundamental part of earning that trust means being clear about how we use your information and protect your right to privacy.

This Privacy Policy describes:

*   the information we collect about you,
*   how we use and share that information, and
*   the privacy choices available to you.

This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when you use our websites (“**Site**”), mobile application (“**App**”) and other online products and services (collectively, the “**Services**”), or when you otherwise interact with us.

From time to time, we may change the provisions of this Privacy Policy. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by updating the date of this Privacy Policy and posting it on the App and the Site. If required by law, we will also provide notification of changes in another way that we believe is reasonably likely to reach you, such as via email or another manner through the App or the Site. We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy regularly to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.

### What Information Do We Collect When You Use Our Services?

#### Information You Provide to Us

We collect information you provide to us, such as when you create an account, verify your identity, update your profile, use the interactive features of our Services, participate in contests, promotions or surveys, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us.

The types of information we may collect include:

*   **Account information**, such as your name, username, gender, birth date, email address, mailing address, city, country, postal code, billing address, phone number and profile picture;
*   **Communications** that we exchange with users when they contact us with questions or feedback, including feedback about interacting with other users, and messages and interactive forum information, such as discussion group posts, messages to other Couchsurfing users and information you provide in connection with activities and events;
*   **Other background, contact and demographic information**, such as your occupation, personal URL, IM username, emergency contact, home descriptions, travel history and plans and other interests and self-descriptions you choose to provide;
*   **Payment and transactional data** when you pay for our Services, including name, payment card information, bank account number, billing information, and your transaction history. This information is collected and processed by our payment providers, Stripe, PayPal  , Google and Apple, and we do not have access to payment card numbers. In addition to this Privacy Policy and our [Terms of Use](https://about.couchsurfing.com/about/terms-of-use), information related to your payments or purchases is also processed according to Stripe’s, PayPal’s, Google’s, and Apple’s service agreements and privacy policies.
*   **Information stored on your mobile device (if you have given us permission to access this information)**, such as your photos, calendar information and your contacts’ name, phone numbers and image thumbnail (if available). In particular, to help users connect with people they know, we offer them the option to invite friends to join them on Couchsurfing. To take advantage of this feature, users can opt in to share phone numbers from their address book or add phone numbers manually.
*   **Identity verification and biometric information, if you elect to use the identity verification service**. If you choose to verify your identity when using the Services, we will ask you to provide a photo of your government-issued ID as well as a selfie to our biometric verification service provider Onfido. Onfido collects, uses, and stores facial geometry extracted from the selfie and the ID to confirm that the two facial images match. This match enables Onfido to verify the user’s identity. Onfido also processes this data as an independent controller to improve its facial recognition technology. Couchsurfing does not retain the facial geometry derived from your ID image and selfie, and we require Onfido to delete this facial geometry after your identity has been verified. For more information, please also see [Onfido’s Facial Scan Policy](https://onfido.com/facial-scan-policy-and-release/), [Privacy Policy](https://onfido.com/privacy/) and [Terms of Service](https://onfido.com/terms-of-service/).

#### Information We Collect Automatically

#### Information We Collect from Other Sources

For example, if you link, connect, or login to the Services through a third-party social networking site, you direct that third-party service to send us information such as your name, connections, email address, birthday, gender, location and other account information in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such third-party social networking site or as authorized by you via your privacy settings at that service.

**Information collected from other Services Users.** We may receive information about you from other Couchsurfing users, such as trust ratings, feedback, friend connections, public references, and other interconnections and interactions between you and other Couchsurfing users.

### Processing of Your Personal Information Abroad

Couchsurfing has users located across the globe. We may store and process personal information in the United States and other countries, which may not have the same data protection laws as your home country or territory. However, wherever we store your information we will treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy or as otherwise disclosed to you. Please note, while Couchsurfing is certified under the EU.-U.S. and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks, following the invalidation of such frameworks we no longer rely on Privacy Shield for our cross-border data transfers. However, we continue to comply with the frameworks. Please read the information below, which we provide in accordance with the Privacy Shield Notice Principle.

Couchsurfing International Inc. complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss - U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union, United Kingdom and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. Couchsurfing International Inc. has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit [https://www.privacyshield.gov/](https://www.privacyshield.gov/).

To the extent required by the Privacy Shield principles or applicable law, you have the opportunity to choose (opt out) whether your personal information is (i) to be disclosed to a third party or (ii) to be used for a purpose that is materially different from the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you. For more information about the choices you have in relation to your personal information, visit the [“Your Information Choices”](#YourInformationChoices), and to exercise your rights please email _privacy@couchsurfing.com_.

In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, we commit to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. Individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact us at _privacy@couchsurfing.com_. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at [https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request](https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request). Note, you may have the possibility, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration for complaints regarding Privacy Shield compliance not resolved by any of the other Privacy Shield mechanisms. For more information about invoking binding arbitration, please review additional information here. Couchsurfing is responsible and liable if third-party agents that it uses to process the personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless Couchsurfing proves that it is not responsible for the event that allowed the damage to occur.

We are subject to investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission with respect to personal information received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework

### Sharing of Information

We share personal information as follows:

*   With your consent;

This information includes your profile picture, name, username and other information you may elect to share in accordance with the privacy settings you establish on the Service.
*   **Social Media Tools**. Couchsurfing may offer social sharing features or other integrated tools which let you share actions you take on our Services with other media, and vice versa. The use of such features enables the sharing of certain information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the third party that provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the third parties that provide these social sharing features. Couchsurfing may also allow you to access Mapbox Maps.

### Third Party Links

Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services as part of our Services. These third parties may have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the activities of these third parties and how they collect, use or share information about you. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our Services and welcome any feedback about these third parties.

### Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others

We may allow third parties to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet and to provide analytics services in relation to the use of our Services. These entities may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites, including your IP address and information about your web browser and operating system, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information. This information may be used by Couchsurfing and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Services and other websites and better understand your online activity. Please note that we may share aggregated or de-identified data with these third parties. For example, we may engage a third party data provider who may collect web log data from you or place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized ads or content. These cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to information you voluntarily provide to us (e.g., an email address) in a hashed, non-human readable form.

In particular, we use:

*   Google Firebase Crashlytics (provided by Google LLC) to get crash reports and metrics and to derive analytics information regarding the use of the App, including by collecting identifiers for mobile devices (including Android Advertising ID and Advertising Identifier for iOS). Firebase Crashlytics retains crash stack traces, extracted minidump data, and associated identifiers (including Crashlytics Installation UUIDs) for 90 days.

### How Do We Protect Your Information?

We take security of your data seriously and take reasonable measures to protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from us may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via the Internet. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any personal information to us via the Internet. In addition, we are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Services, or third party websites. Finally, we cannot control the actions of users on the platform, who may seek to use third party apps or devices to record, store, or share content or communication without other users' prior consent. Please keep this in mind when using the Services.

The Services are not intended for use by children under 18 years of age. If we learn that we have collected personal information through the Services from a child under 18 without the consent of the child’s parent or guardian as required by law, we will delete it.

### Notice To California Residents

We are providing this supplemental privacy notice to Consumers in California, pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“**CCPA**”).

The CCPA grants California residents the following rights:

*   **Information**.Our Privacy Policy describes how we use and share your personal information through the Services, including during the past 12 months. The Policy describes:

a)    The sources through which we collect California residents’ personal information and the types of personal information collected in the [What Information Do We Collect When You Use Our Services?](#WhatInformationDoWeCollect) section above.

The CCPA limits these rights.

Couchsurfing has appointed DataRep as its Data Protection Representative in the EEA and the UK.

DataRep has locations in each of the 27 EU countries, the UK, and Norway & Iceland in the European Economic Area (EEA), so that Couchsurfing's users can always raise the questions they want with them.
