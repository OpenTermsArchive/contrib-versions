**PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY. BY REGISTERING FOR AN ACCOUNT OR BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE AND ALL TERMS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS, DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES.**

These Terms of Use (“Terms”) apply to your access to and use of any website, mobile application or other online or mobile product or service (collectively, the “Services”) of Couchsurfing International, Inc. (“Couchsurfing,” “we” or “us”). If you are using the Services on behalf of any entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to accept these Terms on such entity’s behalf and that such entity will be responsible for your violation of these Terms. Failure to use our Services in accordance with these Terms may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Services and may subject you to legal action by Couchsurfing and/or severe civil and/or criminal penalties.

We reserve the right to make changes or modifications to these Terms, or any policy or guideline of our Services, at any time and in our sole discretion. If Couchsurfing makes changes to these Terms, we will provide notice of such changes, including by revising the date at the top of these Terms. Your continued use of our Services following the posting of changes or modifications will constitute your acceptance of such changes or modifications. Accordingly, you should frequently review these Terms and applicable policies and guidelines to understand the terms and conditions that apply to your use of the Services.

Please refer to our Privacy Policy for information about how Couchsurfing collects, uses and discloses information about our members. In addition, by accessing or using our Services, you agree to adhere to the Community Guidelines.

#### 1\. ELIGIBILITY, REGISTRATION AND ACCOUNT

You must be at least 18 years old to access or use the Services. By registering to use our Services, you represent that you are at least 18 years old. In order to access certain areas and features of our Services, you will need to register for an account using either your email address or your login credentials from a third-party social media site. If you register with your email address, you agree to create a unique password that you do not use with any other online product or service. By registering for an account, you further agree to (a) provide accurate, truthful, current and complete information; (b) maintain and promptly update your account information upon any changes; (c) maintain the security of your account by protecting your password and restricting access to your account; (d) promptly notify Couchsurfing if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to the Services; and (e) take responsibility for all activities that occur under your account and accept all risks of any authorized or unauthorized access.

#### 2\. THIRD PARTY TERMS

Couchsurfing may offer the opportunity to purchase products and services from third parties. You acknowledge that such products and services are offered and sold to you by one or more third parties. For more information, please refer to the applicable third party’s terms of sale and privacy policy that are presented as part of the checkout process.

#### 3\. INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEMBERS

3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members. Our Services provide a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in activities and communicate with one another. Couchsurfing is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization. You are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.

Remember, the Couchsurfing Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and interact with other people around the world. We cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other Couchsurfing members, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Services.

3.2 Identity Verification. We cannot and do not confirm each member’s identity. Although we provide tools intended to assist with identity verification, such as our address verification tool (as described in Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Services. Couchsurfing does not represent or warrant that our tools are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another member. Further, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services. We do not investigate or verify any member’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to the Services (other than the address-verification tool as described in Section 3.3). We encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.

3.3 Our Address-Verification Tool. Our address verification tool is intended merely to confirm that the postal address a member submits to us is an address at which that member is able to access or receive mail. Couchsurfing’s address verification tool is not intended to confirm that a member actually resides at a particular address. While this is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member’s identity or good faith.

3.4 Member-Hosted Events; Couchsurfing Ambassadors. Members may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Couchsurfing members; however, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Couchsurfing and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk. In addition, Couchsurfing members may sign up to become Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the Couchsurfing community, such as meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions. Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of Couchsurfing and Couchsurfing is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these members.

3.5 Release. Because our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”

#### 4\. MEMBER CONDUCT AND CONTENT

The Services include interactive areas where you or other members can create, post or store content, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, videos, graphics or other items or materials on the Services (collectively, “Member Content”). You are solely responsible for your use of such interactive areas and agree that your use of these areas is at your own risk.

4.1 Member Content Restrictions. You are solely responsible for any Member Content that you submit, post or transmit via our Services.

Couchsurfing is not responsible for any Member Content that you or other members post, transmit or store through the Services.

If you become aware of Member Content that violates these Terms, you may notify of us such content by using the reporting tools provided on our Services. Enforcement of these Terms, however, is solely in our discretion and the absence of enforcement in some instances does not waive of our right to enforce the Terms in other instances. In addition, these Terms do not create a private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the Services will not contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.

4.2 Member Conduct. By accessing or using the Services, you agree to act responsibly, exercise good judgment and comply with the Community Guidelines. In addition, you agree not to:

(e) stalk, intimidate, threaten or otherwise harass or cause discomfort to any other member of our Services;

(l) assist any third party in doing any of the foregoing.

4.3 Member Content License. You own all of the Member Content that you post to our Services. If you post Member Content to our Services, you hereby grant us a perpetual (i.e. lasting forever), worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully sublicensable (i.e. we can grant this right to others) license to use, reproduce, display, perform, adapt, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, have distributed and promote such Member Content in any form, in all media now known or hereinafter created (including in emails or other communications to our members) to administer, operate, develop and otherwise provide the Couchsurfing Services. You represent and warrant that (a) you own and control all of the rights to the Member Content that you post or you otherwise have the right to post such Member Content to the Services; (b) the Member Content is accurate and not misleading; and (c) the use and posting of the Member Content you supply does not violate these Terms and will not violate any rights of or cause injury to any person or entity. You own the Member Content that you post to our Services. If Member Content contains information about you, our Privacy Policy will apply, and we encourage you to review this policy for information about how we can use and share such information.

If you provide a Submission, whether by email or otherwise, you agree that it is non-confidential (unless Couchsurfing states otherwise in writing) and shall become the sole property of Couchsurfing. Couchsurfing shall own exclusive rights, including all intellectual property rights, and shall be entitled to the unrestricted use and dissemination of Submissions for any purpose, commercial or otherwise. You acknowledge that Couchsurfing is not obligated to provide acknowledgment or compensation to you in exchange for Submissions.

#### 14\. PRICE CHANGES

**14.1. Membership:**

Your Couchsurfing contributions will continue and automatically renew until terminated. To use the Couchsurfing service you must have Internet access and provide us with one or more Contribution Methods. "Contribution Method" means a current, valid, accepted method of contributing, as may be updated from time to time and which may include contributing through your account with a third party. You must cancel your Couchsurfing contributions before they renew in order to avoid contributing your Couchsurfing contribution for the next contribution cycle to your Contribution Method (see "Cancellation" below).

We may offer a number of contribution plans, including special promotional plans or contributions offered by third parties in conjunction with the provision of their own products and services. We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties. Some membership contribution plans may have differing conditions and limitations, which will be disclosed at your sign-up or in other communications made available to you. You can find specific details regarding your Couchsurfing membership by logging into your account and navigating to "Membership & Contributions" on the "Account & Settings" page.

**14.2. Billing and Cancellation:**

**Contribution Cycle.** The Couchsurfing member contribution and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the service, such as taxes and possible transaction fees, will be charged to your Contribution Method on the next contribution date indicated on "Membership & Contributions" on the "Account & Settings" page. The length of your contribution cycle will depend on the type of contribution plan that you choose when you sign-up for as a member of Couchsurfing. Contributions are fully earned upon payment. In some cases your contribution date may change, for example if your Contribution Method has not successfully settled or if your membership began on a day not contained in a given month. Visit our website and go to "Membership & Contributions" on the "Account & Settings" page to see your next contribution date. We may authorize your Contribution Method in anticipation of membership or service-related charges through various methods, including authorizing it up to approximately one month of service as soon as you register.

**Contribution Methods.** To use the Couchsurfing service you must provide one or more Contribution Methods. You authorize us to charge any Contribution Method associated to your account in case your primary Contribution Method is declined or no longer available to us for payment of your membership contribution. You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a contribution is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not cancel your contributions, we may suspend your access to the service until we have successfully charged a valid Contribution Method. For some Contribution Methods, the issuer may charge you certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your Contribution Method. Check with your Contribution Method service provider for details.

**Updating your Contribution Methods.** You can update your Contribution Methods by contacting our Support Team. We may also update your Contribution Methods using information provided by the payment service providers. Following any update, you authorize us to continue to charge the applicable Contribution Method(s).

**Cancellation.** You can cancel your Couchsurfing contributions at any time, and you will continue to have access to the Couchsurfing service through the end of your contribution period. To cancel, please contact our Support Team. If you cancel your contributions, your account will be accessible until the end of your current contribution period. To see when your contribution period expires, go to "Membership & Contributions" on the "Account & Settings" page. If you signed up for Couchsurfing using your account with a third party, such as Paypal, as a Contribution Method and wish to cancel your Couchsurfing contributions, you may need to do so through that third party, for example by visiting your account with the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or cancelling your contributions to the Couchsurfing service through that third party. You may also find contribution information about your Couchsurfing contributions by visiting your account with the applicable third party.

**Changes to the Price and Contributions Plans.** We reserve the right to change our contribution plans or a
