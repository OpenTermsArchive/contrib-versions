3\. INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEMBERS

3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members. Our Services provide a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in activities and communicate with one another. Couchsurfing is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization. You are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.

Remember, the Couchsurfing Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and interact with other people around the world. We cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other Couchsurfing members, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Services.

3.2 Identity Verification. We cannot and do not confirm each member’s identity. Although we provide tools intended to assist with identity verification, such as our address verification tool (as described in Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Services. Couchsurfing does not represent or warrant that our tools are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another member. Further, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services. We do not investigate or verify any member’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to the Services (other than the address-verification tool as described in Section 3.3). We encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.

3.3 Our Address-Verification Tool. Our address verification tool is intended merely to confirm that the postal address a member submits to us is an address at which that member is able to access or receive mail. Couchsurfing’s address verification tool is not intended to confirm that a member actually resides at a particular address. While this is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member’s identity or good faith.

3.4 Member-Hosted Events. Couchsurfing Ambassadors. Members may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Couchsurfing members. however, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Couchsurfing and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk. In addition, Couchsurfing members may sign up to become Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the Couchsurfing community, such as meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions. Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of Couchsurfing and Couchsurfing is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these members.

3.5 Release. Because our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”

4\. MEMBER CONDUCT AND CONTENT

The Services include interactive areas where you or other members can create, post or store content, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, videos, graphics or other items or materials on the Services (collectively, “Member Content”). You are solely responsible for your use of such interactive areas and agree that your use of these areas is at your own risk.

If you become aware of Member Content that violates these Terms, you may notify of us such content by using the reporting tools provided on our Services. Enforcement of these Terms, however, is solely in our discretion and the absence of enforcement in some instances does not waive of our right to enforce the Terms in other instances. In addition, these Terms do not create a private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the Services will not contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.

Your Couchsurfing contributions will continue and automatically renew until terminated. To use the Couchsurfing service you must have Internet access and provide us with one or more Contribution Methods. "Contribution Method" means a current, valid, accepted method of contributing, as may be updated from time to time and which may include contributing through your account with a third party. You must cancel your Couchsurfing contributions before they renew in order to avoid contributing your Couchsurfing contribution for the next contribution cycle to your Contribution Method (see "Cancellation" below).

We may offer a number of contribution plans, including special promotional plans or contributions offered by third parties in conjunction with the provision of their own products and services. We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties. Some membership contribution plans may have differing conditions and limitations, which will be disclosed at your sign-up or in other communications made available to you. You can find specific details regarding your Couchsurfing membership by logging into your account and navigating to "Membership &. Contributions" on the "Account &. Settings" page.

**Contribution Cycle.** The Couchsurfing member contribution and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the service, such as taxes and possible transaction fees, will be charged to your Contribution Method on the next contribution date indicated on "Membership &. Contributions" on the "Account &. Settings" page. The length of your contribution cycle will depend on the type of contribution plan that you choose when you sign-up for as a member of Couchsurfing. Contributions are fully earned upon payment. In some cases your contribution date may change, for example if your Contribution Method has not successfully settled or if your membership began on a day not contained in a given month. Visit our website and go to "Membership &. Contributions" on the "Account &. Settings" page to see your next contribution date. We may authorize your Contribution Method in anticipation of membership or service-related charges through various methods, including authorizing it up to approximately one month of service as soon as you register.

**Contribution Methods.** To use the Couchsurfing service you must provide one or more Contribution Methods. You authorize us to charge any Contribution Method associated to your account in case your primary Contribution Method is declined or no longer available to us for payment of your membership contribution. You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a contribution is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not cancel your contributions, we may suspend your access to the service until we have successfully charged a valid Contribution Method. For some Contribution Methods, the issuer may charge you certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your Contribution Method. Check with your Contribution Method service provider for details.

**Updating your Contribution Methods.** You can update your Contribution Methods by contacting our Support Team. We may also update your Contribution Methods using information provided by the payment service providers. Following any update, you authorize us to continue to charge the applicable Contribution Method(s).

To cancel, please contact our Support Team. If you cancel your contributions, your account will be accessible until the end of your current contribution period. To see when your contribution period expires, go to "Membership &. Contributions" on the "Account &. Settings" page. If you signed up for Couchsurfing using your account with a third party, such as Paypal, as a Contribution Method and wish to cancel your Couchsurfing contributions, you may need to do so through that third party, for example by visiting your account with the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or cancelling your contributions to the Couchsurfing service through that third party. You may also find contribution information about your Couchsurfing contributions by visiting your account with the applicable third party.

**Changes to the Price and Contributions Plans.** We reserve the right to change our contribution plans or adjust pricing for our service or any components thereof in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion.

At any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our members ("credits"). The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion.
