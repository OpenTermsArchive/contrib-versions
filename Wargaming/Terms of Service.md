**Creating an Account**

4.1. In order to use all features of a Product, you will need to create an Account.

4.2. To create an Account, you must have an e-mail address and will be required to provide certain information. The details of the information that you need to provide are set out in our [Privacy Policy](https://legal.eu.wargaming.net/en/privacy-policy/). It is important that you provide this information truthfully and accurately and keep it up to date, so that we have correct details about you and your Account.

4.3. When creating an Account, you will also be required to provide a username (“**Nickname**”) to represent you in our Products. Your Nickname cannot be transferred to another person, and you may not use a Nickname that is used by someone else. Please refer to section 16.10 below regarding the use of Nicknames in case your Account is terminated.

4.4. In order to use the Products for Xbox®, you will need to visit this [website](http://console.worldoftanks.com/) and sign in using your Microsoft Xbox® Live ID credentials. The Account will be automatically created using your Microsoft Xbox® Live ID credentials (e-mail and nick name (gamertag). For other external/third-party platforms you need to have a separate account and subscription activated.

4.5. You may also log in through some third-party systems if expressly permitted in the Product.

4.6. If expressly permitted by Wargaming, a “demo account” is possible in certain Products. In this case, you will not receive a separate Nickname or password and the authorization for such Product is made through the specific technical device (mobile phone, tablet, etc.) that you use.

4.7. However, you are strongly advised to set up a standard Account in accordance with the above provisions. If a “demo account” is used, your progress in a Product may be lost in case you lose access to your technical device or its software is modified.

**No Account Sharing or Account Transfer**

4.8. Your Account is personal to you and must not be shared, transferred, or traded with any other person. Therefore, you must keep all information relating to your Account confidential. At no time should you disclose your password, secret question, or answer to anyone. **This includes your friends, children, spouses, co-workers, clan members, and/or clan leaders.**

4.9. If you breach section 4.8 and share or transfer your Account, you may be responsible for the conduct and actions of third parties using your Account, including for all violations of this EULA. We reserve the right to suspend access to your Account or to close your Account and terminate this EULA in accordance with sections 16.5-16.9 “Suspension or Termination by Wargaming” if we discover Account sharing or transfer.

**Security of Your Account**

4.10. You must ensure that you secure your Account, computer, mobile phone or other device on which you use our Products from third party access. Please notify us immediately at [https://eu.wargaming.net/support/](https://eu.wargaming.net/support/) if you become aware of:

a) any unauthorised use of your Account or any other breach of security; or

b) any hacking tools being used or that might be used in relation to a Product.

4.11. We have implemented physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard and prevent unauthorised access, use, alteration, modification and/or disclosure of your Account information. We shall have no liability to you for any loss or damage arising from any unauthorised use of your Account or any unauthorised access, use, alteration, modification and/or disclosure of your personal information to the extent it arises from your culpable omissions or negligent conduct. We reserve the right to suspend access to your Account if we discover Account hacking.

**Instructions on withdrawal**

**

Right of withdrawal

You have the right to withdraw from any Contract within 14 calendar days without giving any reason. The withdrawal period will expire after 14 days from the day of the conclusion of the Contract. To exercise the right of withdrawal, you must inform us,

Wargaming Group Limited  
105 Agion Omologiton Avenue  
1080 Nicosia  
Republic of Cyprus  
[wf@wargaming.net](mailto:wf@wargaming.net)  
+357 22 864444  
[https://eu.wargaming.net/support/](https://eu.wargaming.net/support/),

of your decision to withdraw from the Contract by an unequivocal statement (e.g. a letter sent by post or e-mail). You may use the model [withdrawal form](https://content-wg.gcdn.co/web/docs/eu/Model_withdrawal_form.pdf), but it is not obligatory. You can also fill out and submit the model withdrawal form or another clear statement electronically on our website [https://eu.wargaming.net/support/kb/articles/600](https://eu.wargaming.net/support/kb/articles/600). If you make use of this option, we will send you confirmation of receipt of such withdrawal without delay (e.g. by e-mail).

To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.

Effects of withdrawal

If you withdraw from the Contract, we shall reimburse to you all payments received from you under this Contract, including the costs of delivery (with the exception of the supplementary costs resulting from your choice of a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us), without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 calendar days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to withdraw from this Contract. We will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.

If you have requested that the services begin during the withdrawal period, you shall pay us a reasonable amount corresponding to the proportion of the services already provided up to the time you have communicated us of the exercise of the right of withdrawal from that Contract, in comparison with the full coverage of these services under the Contract.

Important:

**

*** You lose your right of withdrawal after the Paid Content or Services have been fully supplied and if the supply has begun with your prior express consent, and with the acknowledgement that you will lose your right of withdrawal once the Paid Content or Services have been fully supplied by us.*** **You lose your right of withdrawal insofar as the Contract comprises the supply of Paid Content or Services which are not supplied on a tangible medium if the supply has begun with your prior express consent and your acknowledgment that you thereby lose your right of withdrawal.**

6.7. Based on the aforesaid you understand that by purchasing Paid Content or Services, you consent that we make available these Paid Content or Services to you directly after we have accepted your order. You will lose your right of withdrawal once the Paid Content or Services have been made fully available to you by us. However, your right of withdrawal is not lost if you order Paid Content or Services that are granted to you for a certain period of time (e.g. time-limited premium memberships).

6.8. Please note that due to technical limitations we cannot warrant that payments made by you via a specific payment method will be reimbursed to you via that same payment method. **You agree that reimbursements for such payments can be facilitated by us via another, common means of payment, e.g. via transfer of money to your bank account, in case reimbursements via these payment methods are technically impossible. In any case, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.**

6.9. Applicable consumer protection law, in particular your right of withdrawal under section 6 “Paid Content or Services”, will not in any way be restricted by this EULA.

We will also communicate to you the text of the updated EULA.

Changes to this EULA shall not affect your accrued rights and shall not have retroactive effect.

**9\. Patches, Updates and Changes**

9.1. From time to time, we may need to deploy or provide patches, updates, additional Content or other modifications (each, a “**Change**”) to the Products. We do so to maintain conformity of the Products or for other important operational reasons, e.g. to adapt the Products to a new technical environment or to an increased number of users, enhance online gameplay, add, update, or remove features, resolve software bugs.

9.2. You hereby accept, recognize and understand that we may further develop, improve, patch, update, change, limit the Products, its graphics, features, gameplay and any Paid Content or Services, including beyond what is necessary to maintain the Paid Content or Services in conformity for other important operational reasons as described in section 9.1.

9.3. Changes include so called “nerfs or buffs” to Paid Content or Services, including the Paid Content or Services that you have already ordered. We will do that only if permitted by law and in accordance with the process required by law, especially only if there is a valid and reasonable cause for example as described in section 9.1 or expiry of rights of use acquired by Wargaming.

9.4. For any upcoming Changes to Paid Content or Services, if a Change has a negative impact on your access to Paid Content or Services, we will inform you immediately about the Change, the characteristics and time of occurrence. If the impact of an upcoming Change is not minor, we undertake to inform you on a durable medium in a clear and comprehensible manner:

(i) of such Changes before or simultaneously with the upcoming Change; and

(ii) the features and time of the Change; and

(ii) after the termination of the Contract, you undertake to refrain from using the Paid Content or Services and/or from making it available to third parties.

9.6. We will carry out any reimbursement other than of the Right of withdrawal to you using the same means of payment. Nevertheless, due to technical limitations we cannot warrant that payments made by you via a specific payment method will be reimbursed to you via that same payment method, in which case you agree that reimbursements for such payments can be facilitated by us via another, common means of payment, e.g. via transfer of money to your bank account, in case reimbursements via that same payment method that you have used are technically impossible. In any case, you will not incur any fees because of such reimbursement.

9.7. Wargaming will do its best to make Content and Products available to you. However, you acknowledge and accept that Content and Products may have a limited lifecycle or that we may no longer be able to provide Content or Product(s) for business reasons or due to legal, technical, or other objective reasons. If we decide to stop providing Content or Product(s), we will inform you 180 calendar days in advance and we will comply with our legal obligations to you. If we have to stop providing Content or Product(s) for legal, technical, or other objective reasons, we will inform you in advance (unless immediate removal of Content or Product(s) is required) and we assume no liability except for the cases where such Content removal or Product closure is due to our fault or if otherwise required by the applicable law.

**10\. Technical Requirements**

10.1. You need certain minimum hardware and software capability (including a suitable connection to the Internet) to use the Products.
