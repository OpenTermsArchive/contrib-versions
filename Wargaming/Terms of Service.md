### **1\. About This EULA** [\[Back to top\]](https://legal.eu.wargaming.net/en/eula-en/#)

This End User License Agreement (or “**EULA**”) governs the relationship between you (“**user**” or “**you**”) and Wargaming Group Limited, a limited liability company registered by the Department of Registrar of Companies and Intellectual Property of the Republic of Cyprus under the number HE290868 at 105 Agion Omologiton Avenue, 1080 Nicosia, Republic of Cyprus or any one of its affiliated entities (“**Wargaming**” or “**we**”) in relation to any of our games, websites, applications, and other software products (“**Products**”).

### **2\. Accepting This EULA** [\[Back to top\]](https://legal.eu.wargaming.net/en/eula-en/#)

2.1. By accepting this EULA, you represent and warrant that you are an individual over the age of eighteen (or other age of majority in your country of residence). If you are under the age of majority, you must ask your parent or guardian to read and accept this EULA on your behalf before you use our Products. You may not use or access our Products if you (or your parent or guardian) do not agree to this EULA.

2.2. If you permit your minor child or legal ward to use the Products, you agree to this EULA on behalf of them and yourself. You understand and agree that you are responsible for all uses of the Products by your child or legal ward and that you have the same duty of care as in your own matters. You agree that you will not knowingly allow any individual under the age of majority to use or access the Products without a parent or legal guardian supervising him or her.

2.3. If you are a resident of the United States, you must be at least 13 years of age to use our Products. Otherwise, you are not granted a license to use or access the Products. You agree that you will not knowingly allow any individual under the age of 13 to use or access our Products.

### **3\. Amendments to This EULA** [\[Back to top\]](https://legal.eu.wargaming.net/en/eula-en/#)

3.1. From time to time, we may need to amend this EULA for serious reasons, for example to reflect new features and functionalities in the Products, to enhance security of our users, or to comply with changes in law.

3.2. We will notify you of the changes via e-mail or on other durable medium no later than 30 calendar days before such changes come into force. In the notification, we will inform you about the changes, your right to object, the notice period and the legal consequences of a failure to object. We will also communicate to you the text of the updated EULA. Where permitted by law, we reserve the right to send such notice via other commonly used notification mechanisms (for example, in-game pop-up message or a message in the account management section) reasonably in advance.

3.3. We will obtain your consent where required by law. Otherwise, you shall be deemed to have accepted the changes unless you have notified us of your objection to such changes within thirty (30) calendar days from the moment of receiving the notification from us.

3.4. In case you object to any changes, the previous version of the EULA shall continue to apply. However, in that case we may close your Account and terminate this EULA with 14 calendar days’ notice. Also, if you disagree with the changes, you can terminate the EULA by deleting your Account using the “Account Deletion” tool in your Account Management [here](https://wargaming.net/personal/) and, for console Products, [here](https://console.worldoftanks.com/accounts/management/) and [here](https://lg.wowslegends.com/personal/privacy/).

3.5. The latest version of this EULA will always be available on this website or at other address that we will communicate to you. If you are a California resident, you may have this EULA mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to our [Player Support](https://wargaming.net/support/) with your electronic mail address and a request for this EULA. Changes to this EULA shall not affect your accrued rights and shall not have retroactive effect.

### **4\. Your Wargaming Account** [\[Back to top\]](https://legal.eu.wargaming.net/en/eula-en/#)

**Creating an Account**

4.1. You need to create a Wargaming account to use all features of our Products. A Wargaming account is a collection of data associated with a particular individual that is required for his or her use of the Products, including authentication (authorisation), access to settings, statistics and other information, and use of Paid Items (the “**Account**”).

4.2. To create an Account, you must have a valid and non-disposable e-mail address and will be required to provide certain information about you. You must provide this information truthfully and accurately and keep it up to date, so that we have correct details about you and your Account. If expressly permitted in the Product, you may also create an Account and log in through a third-party system.

4.3. When creating an Account, you will be required to provide an in-game name (“**Nickname**”) to represent you in our Products. Your Nickname cannot be transferred to another person, and you may not use a Nickname that is used by someone else. However, we may allow other players to use your Nickname if your Account is deleted.

4.4. To use our Products on third-party platforms, you need to have a separate account on those platforms. Also, you must comply with the terms and conditions set by those third-party platforms.

4.5. If expressly permitted by Wargaming, a “demo account” is possible in certain Products. In this case, you will not receive a separate Nickname or password and the authorization for such Product is made through the specific technical device (mobile phone, tablet, etc.) that you use. However, you are strongly advised to set up a standard Account in accordance with the above provisions. If a “demo account” is used, your progress in a Product may be lost in case you lose access to your technical device or its software is modified.

**No Account Sharing or Account Transfer**

4.6. Your Account is personal to you and must not be shared, transferred, or traded with any other person. At no time should you disclose your password and other login credentials to anyone. **This includes your friends, children, spouses, co-workers, clan members, and/or clan leaders.**

4.7. If you share or transfer your Account, you may be responsible for the conduct and actions of third parties using your Account, including for all violations of this EULA. We reserve the right to suspend access to your Account or to close your Account and terminate this EULA in accordance with sections 19.4-19.9 “Suspension or Termination by Wargaming” of this EULA if we discover Account sharing or transfer.

**Security of Your Account**

4.8. You must ensure that you secure your Account, computer, mobile phone or other device on which you use our Products from third party access. Please notify us immediately if you become aware of:

1. Any unauthorised use of your Account or any other breach of security; or
2. Any hacking tools being used or that might be used in relation to our Products.

4.9. We have implemented physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard and prevent unauthorised access, use, alteration, modification and/or disclosure of your Account information. We will have no liability to you for any loss or damage arising from any unauthorised use of your Account or any unauthorised access, use, alteration, modification and/or disclosure of your personal data to the extent it arises from your culpable omissions or negligent conduct. We reserve the right to suspend access to your Account if we discover Account hacking. If you believe that we have suspended access to your Account in error, please contact our [Player Support](https://wargaming.net/support/).

**Deletion of Inactive Accounts**

4.10. We may delete your Account if your Account is inactive. Your Account is inactive if you have not logged in your Account for a consecutive period of ten (10) years. We will inform you at least forty-five (45) days before we delete your Account and you will have the possibility to prevent your Account from being deleted by logging into your Account and restoring your Account until the date set out in the information about the planned deletion. When we delete your Account, your personal data will be deleted or anonymized. For more information on how we delete your data, please see our [Privacy Policy](https://legal.eu.wargaming.net/en/privacy-policy/).

### **9\. Paid Items** [\[Back to top\]](https://legal.eu.wargaming.net/en/eula-en/#)

9.1. Some Products may permit you to order virtual items, in-game currency, premium membership, or other content or services (“**Paid Items**”). If you decide to order any such Paid Items, you must ensure that:

1. You are either an individual over the age of majority or, if you are under the age of majority or if you have limited legal capacity, that your parent or legal guardian has agreed to and accepted the respective order on your behalf;
2. You are the authorised Account holder for the Account from which you are making the order;
3. You are authorised to use the particular credit card or other accepted method of payment; and
4. All information that you submit is true and accurate.

9.2. The following rules apply to Paid Items:

1. To order Paid Items, you need to have an Account, initiate and conclude the order process.
2. If you would like to order Paid Items, you must log in into your Account and enter the requested information about you and your payment method. When you click the “PAY NOW” button (or a similar conspicuously designated button), you make a binding offer to Wargaming to conclude a contract for the supply of Paid Items (“**Contract**”). Until the moment you click such button, you can correct the data that you have entered. Our confirmation of the Contract by e-mail represents our acceptance of your offer (time of the conclusion of the Contract).
3. In case we accept your order, we will, directly after that, credit the ordered Paid Items to your Account and we will charge you via your selected payment method. You will also receive a confirmation of your order via e-mail, containing the Contract details and an electronic copy of this EULA.
4. The Contract will be concluded in the language of the country where you live. If permitted by applicable law, the Contract may be concluded in the English language.
5. Paid Items may only be redeemed for other content and services where permitted in the Products.
6. Paid Items cannot be sold or transferred to anyone. However, you may buy Paid Items for another user as a Gift if permitted in the Products. The process for buying and accepting Gifts will be clearly specified in the interface of the respective Product in advance.
7. Paid Items cannot be exchanged for cash or any goods or services.
8. You may only acquire Paid Items from us (or from any person that we authorise for this purpose) or from another user as a Gift if permitted in the Products, and you must not obtain Paid Items from any other person or in any other way or attempt to do so; and
9. We may reject an offer to order Paid Items.

9.3. If you receive content, services, achievements, or Paid Items free of charge, at a lower price or without performing the actions that are normally required for receipt (i) due to a technical error (a bug), you must report this to Wargaming immediately; or (ii) due to hacking, fraud or other illegal actions, you must report this to Wargaming immediately and pay for such Paid Items to the extent already consumed. Wargaming may delete such Paid Items and achievements and, if you have already consumed the Paid Items, to block access to your Account until you reimburse the full price of the corresponding Paid Items.

9.4. THIS SECTION 9.4 APPLIES TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU SHALL HAVE NO OWNERSHIP OR OTHER PROPERTY INTEREST IN YOUR ACCOUNT, AND THAT ALL RIGHTS IN AND TO YOUR ACCOUNT ARE AND SHALL FOREVER BE OWNED BY AND INURE TO THE BENEFIT OF WARGAMING. YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO CLAIM, RIGHT, TITLE, OWNERSHIP, OR OTHER PROPRIETARY INTEREST IN THE PAID ITEMS THAT YOU UNLOCK OR ACCUMULATE, REGARDLESS OF ANY CONSIDERATION OFFERED OR PAID IN EXCHANGE FOR SUCH PAID ITEMS. FURTHERMORE, WARGAMING SHALL NOT BE LIABLE IN ANY MANNER FOR THE DESTRUCTION, DELETION, MODIFICATION, IMPAIRMENT, HACKING, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGE OR LOSS OF ANY KIND CAUSED TO THE GAME CONTENT OR PAID ITEMS, INCLUDING THE DELETION OF GAME CONTENT OR PAID ITEMS UPON THE TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION OF YOUR ACCOUNT. YOUR RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL UNDER SECTION 10, RIGHT TO REIMBURSEMENT UNDER SECTION 13.5, AND OTHER CONSUMER GUARANTEES SET OUT IN THIS EULA OR CONTAINED IN APPLICABLE LAW REMAIN UNAFFECTED BY THIS SECTION 9.4.

9.5. In addition to the rules set out in sections 9.1-9.4 above, the following rules apply to Subscriptions:

**Subscription Rules**  
  
**Definition. Price and Conditions**  
  
9.5.1. Certain Products may permit you to order Paid Items subject to automatic billing of your selected payment method at pre-determined time intervals (“**Subscriptions**”).  
  
9.5.2. The Paid Items that you may subscribe to, the initial period of the Subscription, the price of the Subscription, the time intervals at which your payment method will be billed, and other details of the Subscription shall be clearly specified in the Subscription interface before you subscribe.  
  
**Price Changes**  
  
9.5.3. Wargaming reserves the right to adjust the Subscription price to reflect the factors that influence the cost of the Subscription (“**Subscription Price Change**“). Examples of such factors are production and licensing costs, costs for technical provision and distribution, support services and other additional services that can be accessed and used via independent platforms, web applications and social networks, as well as costs of sales (e.g. billing and payment, marketing, public relations), general administrative and other overhead costs (e.g. rent, interest and other financing costs, costs for personnel, service providers and services, IT systems, energy), as well as government-imposed fees, contributions, taxes and duties.  
  
9.5.4. Wargaming shall notify you of a Subscription Price Change at least 30 calendar days in advance. Such notification shall be sent to you via e-mail or on other durable medium. Where permitted by law, we reserve the right to send such notice via other commonly used notification mechanisms (for example, in-game pop-up message or a message in the account management section) reasonably in advance. The notification shall contain the new Subscription price and an explanation of the main factors contributing to the Subscription Price Change as well as instructions and a possibility to easily terminate the Subscription (e.g. a link to unsubscribe). We will obtain your consent to the Subscription Price Change where required by law. Otherwise, you shall be deemed to have accepted the Subscription Price Change unless you have unsubscribed before the new price is effective.  
  
**The Right to Terminate Subscription**  
  
9.5.5. You may terminate your Subscription at any time with effect from the next Billing Period. Your statutory right to extraordinary termination for good cause remain unaffected.  
  
9.5.6. You can terminate your Subscription by logging in to your Account and pressing an “Unsubscribe” button (or a similar conspicuously named button) on the same webpage where you purchased the Subscription or by following a different process specified for a particular Subscription. Where required by applicable law, Wargaming provides a mechanism for terminating Subscriptions without logging in to your Account.  
  
9.5.7. Wargaming may terminate your Subscription at any time with at least 2 (two) calendar days’ notice, subject to a proportionate refund of any unused Subscription time. Wargaming may also terminate the Subscription immediately for good cause, in particular if the user fails to pay the Subscription Price or if the extraordinary termination is justified taking into account mutual interest (for example, if Wargaming suspends the user’s Account or closes the user’s access to a game or the games in which the Subscription is active in accordance with sections 19.4-19.9 “Suspension or Termination by Wargaming” of this EULA).  
  
**Failure to Pay**  
  
9.5.8. If the Subscription Price is not paid due to the user’s fault, Wargaming may temporarily suspend the Subscription until the payment is made. The Subscription shall not expire, but shall be paused, except for the cases when Wargaming terminates the subscription in accordance with section 9.5.7 of these Rules. Any further legal claims and/or claims of Wargaming arising from the EULA shall remain unaffected.  
  
**Rules in Case of Suspension and Closure of Access**  
  
9.5.9. If you breach the EULA and Wargaming suspends your access to a game (games) or the Account in accordance with sections 19.4-19.9 “Suspension or Termination by Wargaming” of this EULA, the Subscription will continue to run, and the Subscription time that expires during the suspension will not be refunded.  
  
9.5.10. If you breach the EULA and Wargaming permanently closes your access to a game (games) or the Account in accordance with sections 19.4-19.9 “Suspension or Termination by Wargaming” of this EULA, Wargaming will terminate your Subscription in the respective game (games) and the unused Subscription time will not be refunded.

9.6. If you reside in the United States, your payment may be processed by a payment services provider for Wargaming Group Limited through its subsidiary Wargaming (USA), Inc. (a Delaware corporation registered at 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington DE USA 19801).

If you do not want to have your card details automatically updated, please contact your issuing bank.

### **10\. Right of Withdrawal** [\[Back to top\]](https://legal.eu.wargaming.net/en/eula-en/#)

You have a right to withdraw from your Contract with us if you reside in certain countries mentioned below:

**Member States of the European Union; United Kingdom  
  
Instructions on withdrawal  
  
Right of withdrawal  
  
You have the right to withdraw from any Contract within 14 calendar days without giving any reason. The withdrawal period will expire after 14 days from the day of the conclusion of the Contract. To exercise the right of withdrawal, you must inform us,  
  
Wargaming Group Limited  
105 Agion Omologiton Avenue  
1080 Nicosia  
Republic of Cyprus  
[wf@wargaming.net](mailto:wf@wargaming.net)  
+357 22 864444  
[https://wargaming.net/support/](https://wargaming.net/support/),  
  
of your decision to withdraw from the Contract by an unequivocal statement (e.g. a letter sent by post, fax or e-mail). You may use the model withdrawal form, but it is not obligatory. You can also fill out and submit the model withdrawal form or another clear statement electronically on our website [https://eu.wargaming.net/support/kb/articles/600](https://eu.wargaming.net/support/en/products/wot/article/10541/?redirect_lang=en). If you make use of this option, we will send you confirmation of receipt of such withdrawal without delay (e.g. by e-mail).  
  
To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.  
  
Effects of withdrawal  
  
If you withdraw from the Contract, we shall reimburse to you all payments received from you under this Contract, including the costs of delivery (with the exception of the supplementary costs resulting from your choice of a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us), without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 calendar days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to withdraw from this Contract. We will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.  
  
If you have requested that the services begin during the withdrawal period, you shall pay us a reasonable amount corresponding to the proportion of the services already provided up to the time you have communicated us of the exercise of the right of withdrawal from that Contract, in comparison with the full coverage of these services under the Contract.  
  
Important:  
  
You lose your right of withdrawal after the Paid Items have been fully supplied and if the supply has begun with your prior express consent, and with the acknowledgement that you will lose your right of withdrawal once the Paid Items have been fully supplied by us.  
  
You lose your right of withdrawal insofar as the Contract comprises the supply of Paid Items which are not supplied on a tangible medium if the supply has begun with your prior express consent and your acknowledgment that you thereby lose your right of withdrawal.**  
  
Based on the aforesaid you understand that by purchasing Paid Items, you consent that we make available these Paid Items to you directly after we have accepted your order. You will lose your right of withdrawal once the Paid Items have been made fully available to you by us. However, your right of withdrawal is not lost if you order Paid Items that are granted to you for a certain period of time (e.g. time-limited premium memberships).  
  
Please note that due to technical limitations we cannot warrant that payments made by you via a specific payment method will be reimbursed to you via that same payment method. You agree that reimbursements for such payments can be facilitated by us via another, common means of payment, e.g. via transfer of money to your bank account, in case reimbursements via these payment methods are technically impossible. In any case, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.

13.1. From time to time, we may need to deploy or provide patches, updates, additional Content or other modifications (each, a “**Change**”) to the Products. We do so to maintain conformity of the Products or for other important operational reasons, e.g. to adapt the Products to a new technical environment or to an increased number of users, enhance online gameplay, add, update, or remove features, resolve software bugs.

13.2. You hereby accept, recognize and understand that we may further develop, improve, patch, update, change, limit the Products, its graphics, features, gameplay and any Paid Items, including beyond what is necessary to maintain the Paid Items in conformity for other important operational reasons as described in section 13.1 above.

13.3. Changes include so called “nerfs or buffs” to Paid Items, including the Paid Items that you have already acquired. We will do that only if permitted by law and in accordance with the process required by law, especially only if there is a valid and reasonable cause for example as described in section 13.1 or expiry of rights of use acquired by Wargaming.

13.4. Wargaming will do its best to make Content and Products available to you. However, you acknowledge and accept that Content and Products may have a limited lifecycle or that we may no longer be able to provide Content or Product(s) for business reasons or due to legal, technical, or other objective reasons.

– After the termination of the Contract, you undertake to refrain from using the Paid Items and/or from making it available to third parties.  
  
13.5.3. We will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment that you used. However, due to technical limitations we cannot warrant that payments made by you via a specific payment method will be reimbursed to you via that same payment method, in which case you agree that reimbursements for such payments can be facilitated by us via another, common means of payment, e.g. via transfer of money to your bank account, in case reimbursements via that same payment method that you have used are technically impossible.

### **16\. Epilepsy Warning** [\[Back to top\]](https://legal.eu.wargaming.net/en/eula-en/#)

Certain people are susceptible to epileptic seizures or loss of consciousness when exposed to certain flashing lights or light patterns in everyday life.

If you or anyone in your family has ever had symptoms related to epilepsy (seizures or loss of consciousness) when exposed to flashing lights, consult your doctor prior to playing. We advise that parents should monitor the use of video games by their children. If you or your child experience any of the following symptoms: dizziness, blurred vision, eye or muscle twitches, loss of consciousness, disorientation, any involuntary movement or convulsion, while playing a video game, IMMEDIATELY discontinue use of the video game and consult your doctor. Please also note that when using a video game you should take certain standard health and safety precautions, including avoiding playing the game when tired or fatigued, taking 10 to 15 minute breaks every hour, sitting a reasonable distance from the screen, and playing the game in a well-lit environment.

**If YOU RESIDE IN ANOTHER COUNTRY:**  
  
17.8. **Indemnity.** You agree that you are responsible for your use of the Products, and you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Wargaming and its affiliates, and their officers, directors, employees, consultants, and agents (collectively, the “**Wargaming Entities**”) from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with (i) your access to, use of, or alleged use of the Products; (ii) your violation of this EULA or any representation, warranty, or agreements referenced herein, or any applicable law or regulation; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; (iv) your Submissions; (v) your use of Third Party Services; (vi) any misrepresentation by you or (vii) any disputes or issues between you and any third party.

EACH PROVISION OF THIS EULA THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THIS EULA BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS EULA. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 17.10 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

### **20\. Governing Law and Jurisdiction** [\[Back to top\]](https://legal.eu.wargaming.net/en/eula-en/#)

This section 20 applies to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

**If YOU RESIDE IN A EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATE OR IN THE UNITED KINGDOM:**  
  
20.1. The law of the Republic of Cyprus shall apply, excluding the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) and the conflict of laws rules. If you are a consumer habitually resident in the EU, you also enjoy protection of the mandatory provisions of the law of your country of residence. The non-exclusive jurisdiction of the court of Cyprus is agreed. This means that you may bring an action to enforce your consumer protection rights in connection with this EULA either in Cyprus or in your country of residence. If you reside in Germany, German law shall apply and the jurisdiction of the courts of Germany is agreed (this means that you may bring an action to enforce your consumer protection rights in connection with this EULA in Germany).  
  
20.2. In case of any disputes relating to the interpretation, performance or validity of this EULA, an amicable solution will be sought before any legal action, unless otherwise required by the laws of your country of residence.  
  
20.3. If you reside in the EU (also in Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein), you may address the European Commission through its Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) platform for EU consumers: [https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/). We however do not participate in this platform. In addition, you have the right to contact out-of-court dispute resolution bodies in your country of residence in case of a dispute with us based on the consumer protection law.

**IF YOU RESIDE IN THE UNITED STATES OR BRING A CLAIM AGAINST WARGAMING IN THE UNITED STATES:**  
  
**20.4. Governing Law**  
  
This EULA and any dispute, claim or obligation (whether contractual or non-contractual) arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation shall be governed by laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to the conflict of laws principles thereof. To the extent that any lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted hereunder, you and Wargaming agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within Alameda County, California, USA for the purpose of litigating all such disputes.  
  
**20.5. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration.**  
  
20.5.1. **Generally.** In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Wargaming in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Wargaming agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with this EULA shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can generally award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to, any and all claims, whether past, present or future, arising out of or relating to any aspect of this EULA or any other services, programs, marketing, advertising solicitations or conduct relating to our relationship, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of this EULA. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS EULA, YOU AND WARGAMING ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.  
  
20.5.2. **Exceptions.** Notwithstanding subsection 20.5.1, we both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local authorities charged by law with the enforcement of such actions, or (iii) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.  
  
20.5.3. **Arbitrator.** Any arbitration between you and Wargaming will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “**AAA Rules**“) of the American Arbitration Association (“**AAA**“), as modified by this EULA, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org or by contacting Wargaming.  
  
20.5.4. **Notice; Process.** A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (“**Notice**“). Wargaming’s address for Notice is: Wargaming Group Limited, 105, Agion Omologiton Avenue, Nicosia 1080, Cyprus. The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“**Demand**“). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Wargaming may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Wargaming shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Wargaming shall pay you (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by Wargaming in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000.00, whichever is greater.  
  
20.5.5. **Fees and Location.** In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with this EULA, Wargaming will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $50,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Wargaming for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.  
  
20.5.6. **No Class or Similar Proceedings.** YOU AND WARGAMING AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Wargaming agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.  
  
20.5.7. **Governing Law.** The Dispute Resolution and Arbitration provision set forth in this section 20.5 is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the “FAA”), and not Federal or state rules of civil procedure or evidence or any state laws that pertain specifically to arbitration. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of the Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Provision. The arbitrator shall follow applicable substantive law to the extent consistent with the FAA, applicable statutes of limitation and applicable privilege rules, and, subject to any applicable limits thereon, shall be authorized to award all remedies available in an individual lawsuit under applicable substantive law, including compensatory, statutory and punitive damages (which shall be governed by the constitutional standards applicable in judicial proceedings), declaratory, injunctive and other equitable relief, and attorneys’ fees and costs.

**20.6. Governing (Applicable) Law and Jurisdiction**

Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of this EULA, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of this EULA. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS EULA, YOU AND WARGAMING ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY.  
  
20.7.2. **Exceptions.** Notwithstanding subsection 20.7.1, we both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable government agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.  
  
20.7.3. **Arbitrator.** Any arbitration between you and Wargaming will be governed by the Resolution Institute Arbitration Rules (“**Arbitration Rules**”) of the Resolution Institute, as modified by this EULA. The Arbitration Rules are available online at [https://resolution.institute/](https://resolution.institute/), by calling the Resolution Institute on 1800 651 650 (Australia) or 0800 453 237 (New Zealand), or by contacting Wargaming.  
  
20.7.4. **Notice; Process.** A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, we may send the notice by electronic mail (“**Notice**“). Wargaming’s address for Notice is: Wargaming Group Limited, 105 Agion Omologiton Avenue, Nicosia 1080, Cyprus. The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“**Demand**“).

During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Wargaming shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.  
  
20.7.5. **Hearing.** The location for any arbitration hearing will be decided by the Arbitrator in accordance with the Arbitration Rules. If the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing.  
  
20.7.6. **No Consolidated Actions.** Unless both you and Wargaming agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.  
  
20.7.7. **Amendments to this section.** In the event that Wargaming makes any future change to this section 20.7 “Dispute Resolution and Arbitration” (other than a change to Wargaming’s address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Wargaming’s address for Notice, in which case your account with Wargaming shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject shall survive.  
  
20.7.8. **Enforceability.** If subsection 20.7.1 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this section 20.7 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this section 20.7 shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in section 20.6 shall govern any action arising out of or in connection with this EULA.

**IF YOU RESIDE IN ANOTHER COUNTRY:**  
  
20.8.
