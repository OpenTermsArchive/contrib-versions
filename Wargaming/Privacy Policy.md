**4\. GENERAL INFORMATION IN BRIEF**

We process Personal Data only when necessary for the performance of a contract with you, for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or based on our legitimate interests, except where such interests are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms for which require the protection of your Personal Data.

Our legitimate interests are to render and improve our Products in an effective, safe and harmless manner. We want to provide everyone with a fair and balanced experience when using our Products.

**4.1. YOUR PREFERENCES**

You can choose how we use your Personal Data using the Account Management tool. As we need to verify your identity before we follow your instructions on Personal Data use, you need to have a registered Account in order to access the Account Management tool. This means that if you are using a demo version of the Account, you will only be able to fully control our use of your data after you complete the Account.

For example, through the Account Management tool you can:

* opt-out of receiving direct marketing, offered via email, within Games and online. Read more below in Section 8.1 “Opt-Out of Direct Marketing and Right to Object”;
* access the Personal Data we collect and store about you. Read more below in Section 8.2 “Right of Access”;
* have your Account, and the related Personal Data, deleted. Read more below in Section 8.4 “Right to erasure”.

**4.2. INFORMATION SECURITY**

We maintain reasonable and appropriate security safeguards designed to protect your information from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into due account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the information.

**4.3. PROCESSING INFORMATION BY THIRD PARTIES**

We may share Personal Data with our affiliates, subsidiaries, vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this Policy. For example, we may hire companies to assist with protecting and securing our systems or Products. Any vendor or agent that we retain must comply with our data privacy and security requirements and are not allowed to use personal data they receive from us for any other purpose unless so instructed by us. Those companies may be located outside of the European Economic Area. Read more in Section 7 “How we share your information”.

**4.4. CHILDREN**

We recognise that we have a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from children. We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from any child, or process such information, without parental consent. For the purpose of this Policy, a child means any individual who is under the age of 18 (or the minimum legal age to consent to the collection and processing of Personal Data where this is different under applicable law). If you are a parent or guardian and believe we have collected your child’s information in violation of applicable law, contact us at [privacy@wargaming.net](mailto:privacy@wargaming.net). We will remove the information in accordance with applicable law.

**4.5. DATA RETENTION**

We keep most of your Personal Data collected and processed for the purposes described in this Policy for as long as you continue to use our Products, e.g. you have an active Account in one of our Games. We will delete your Personal Data after you request your Account to be deleted via the Account Management and the grace period of 45 (forty-five) calendar days, during which we can restore your Account, expires. The process of erasing your Personal Data can take up to one month from expiry of the grace period and, considering the complexity and number of requests, may be extended by a further two months. Read more in Section 8.4 “Right to erasure”.

**4.6. GAMES NOT USING THE ACCOUNT**  
Some of the Games do not use the Account. You will not be able to exercise your rights with regard to those Games through the Account Management tool. For this reason, we are offering you other tools to export your Personal Data, delete them, and object to our use of your Personal Data in accordance with Section 8 “Your rights”, as well as to manage your subscriptions.  
Also, there are some differences in the Personal Data that we collect about users of the Games for which the Account is created and users of other Games.  
With regard to the Games that do not use the Account, you can exercise your rights by contacting directly our Player Support or as otherwise indicated in the respective Game.  
Where such function is available, you may link to your Account some of the Games that do not use the Account. Please note that control over your Personal Data in such Games is separate from control over your Personal Data relating to your Account. For example, to delete your Personal Data in “World of Warships Blitz” you will need to contact Player Support as suggested in this Game, while deletion of the Personal Data relating to your Account shall be performed through the Account Management tool.

**5.2.1. Tracking Data and Cookies**

We and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers, use cookies, which are text files placed on your computer, to help us analyse how users use our Products, and similar technologies (e.g. web beacons, pixels, tags and device identifiers) to recognise you and/or your device(s) on, off and across different devices and our Products, as well as to improve the Products we are offering, to improve marketing, analytics or website functionality.

Website traffic volume and patterns, such as the number of visitors to a given website or page on a daily basis is typically referred to as “**Tracking Data**”. This type of indirectly collected information is gathered through various means, such as an IP address, which is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web. Web servers, the computers that “serve up” web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you visit any of our Sites, our servers log your computer’s IP address.

Like most online services, we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies to provide and personalize the Service, analyse use, target advertisements and prevent fraud. You can disable cookies in your browser settings, but some parts of the Service may then not function properly.

If you wish to limit behaviourally targeted advertising, you can do so by limiting ad tracking in your device settings. Please note that opt-outs are specific to each browser and device and it may take a little bit of time before your opt-out choice will take effect.

For mobile advertising in apps, you can reset your Advertising Identifier and depending on your device, select to opt out of interest-based ads (Android) or turn on the Limit Ad Tracking setting (iOS).

For display advertising on the Web, you can also adjust your browser settings to limit certain tracking by means of cookies (e.g. for Chrome [https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en)), and by visiting the following sites: [http://www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices) and [http://www.youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/).

**Do Not Track**: Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no industry consensus as to what site and app operators should do with regard to these signals. Accordingly, unless and until the law is interpreted to require us to do so, we do not monitor or take action with respect to “Do Not Track” signals. For more information on “Do Not Track” visit [http://www.allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/).

**5.2.3. Device Information and Geo-Location**

In order to fix crashes and other technical issues that may arise while you are installing the Games and using our Products, as well as to make our Products more suitable for you, we collect, store and use information about the device you are using the Products on, including what type of device it is, what hardware and operating system you are using, the device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data (if any). Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you are using and its settings. You may also install applications collecting and using additional data required for fixing crashes, errors and other technical issues arising during your use of the Products, e.g., Wargaming Game Center and Wargaming Check.

To make our Products more suitable for you and only upon your permission we can also collect your precise GPS location from mobile devices. Wi-Fi and IP addresses received from your browser or device may be used to determine approximate location.

If the data can be used to prove that cheating or another fraud or EULA violation has occurred, we will further store the data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims during the applicable statute of limitations. Please note that the specific data stored for this purpose may not be disclosed to you or any third parties, since the disclosure will compromise the mechanism through which we detect, investigate and prevent frauds and cheating in the Game, as well as other EULA violations.

**5.2.5. Information from publicly available online resources**

We may use the information made publicly available, e.g. through YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, in order to find out your opinion about Games and Products, so that we could take them into account while improving our Products.

Also, we get information relating to your account on social networking sites in order to allow you to integrate or link your social network account with your Account or our Products. For example, you may link your Account via your YouTube account credentials. In such case, we will collect from YouTube your channel ID to link your social network account with your Account. If you are a content creator, we may access your channel subscribers/members to find our players’ accounts to provide them with some in-game customization or goods. Any personal data collected from such sources will be stored in accordance with this policy.

We also automatically collect information via our Games application technologies that are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings or cannot be controlled via the Account Management tool or while you play our Games. For example, our Games applications may include SDKs, which is code that sends information about your use to a server, for instance through the Facebook SDK or other partner’s SDKs. These SDKs allows us to track our conversions, bring you advertising, and provide you with additional functionality, such as the ability to connect our Products with other services.

The categories of sources from which we collect information include:

**5.3.1. Game platforms:** We collect data (such as the relevant user identifier, email, nickname), from partners that make our Games available on their platforms, such as Valve (Steam), Apple (iOS), and Google (Android).

When you play our Console Games, we collect data (such as email) from the gaming platforms on which you play the Console Games, such as Microsoft (Xbox) and Sony (PlayStation™Network).

**6\. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION**

We need to process your Personal Data in order to perform the contract with you. As a user, we will use your Personal Data, unless otherwise prohibited by law, for the following purposes:

* to provide you with the Products you request, i.e., to ;allow your installation of the Games, operate the Products and verify and confirm your payments;

* to provide support including, but not limited to, product updates, product patches and fixes and other similar communications;

**6.1. COMMUNICATION PURPOSES**

We will use your Personal Data for our legitimate interests to advertise our Products in accordance with this Policy. Namely, once you have created an Account we may use your email address, nickname, IP address, mobile phone number, in order to send you personalized marketing emails, messages, targeted in-game and web offers about Games. Also, if you opt-in, we will send you personalized marketing emails, messages and in-game and web offers about Wargaming offline events, co-projects of Wargaming and its partners, as well as about Wargaming games, not using Wargaming ID.

**6.2. IN-GAME OFFERS**  
We will also use the Game-Related Information to send you in-game offers that we believe are most useful to you. To make the offer we first collect Game-Related Information from various players, identify patterns in their behaviour, and create algorithms that identify pools of players following the pattern or particular players who follow the pattern. To those players who actually follow the pattern – we send the in-game offers, which can be personalized (i.e., we want the in-game offer to reach you or a relatively small number of players specifically) or non-personalized (i.e., we want the in-game offer to reach a large number of players following a pattern). We always make sure that such offers have no significant impact on you or our other players. For example, we may notice that you are a player who is very good at playing with French vehicles and has registered the account more than five years ago: so, we may specifically offer you the new French vehicle for rent, but in any case not more expensively than it is offered to other users. You can unsubscribe from personalized in-Game offers through our Account Management tool.

**6.3. PRODUCTS IMPROVEMENT PURPOSES**

We analyse your information to identify how to improve the Products and our operations to make them more suitable and interesting for our players in general. We also may ask you to respond to our Products-related surveys or questionnaires, and you always have the choice about whether to respond to them and which information you provide.

**6.4. FRAUD AND EULA VIOLATIONS DETECTION**

We use the information required for our detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game and violations of EULA and Game Rules and policies only for the purposes of detection, investigation and prevention. If the data can be used to prove that cheating or another fraud or EULA violation has occurred, we will further store the data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims during the applicable statute of limitations.

**6.5. AUDIENCE MATCHING SERVICES**

We will also use your information for audience matching services to reach people (or people similar to people) who have used or visited our Products or are identified in one or more of our databases (“**Matched Ads**“). This is done by us sharing a list of hashed emails. For instance, we use Facebook Custom Audiences to serve ads to our players on Facebook and Facebook Lookalike Audiences to serve ads to users on Facebook similar to our players.

Vendors and ad partners may act as our processors or in certain contexts, they may act as data controllers and independently decide how to process your information. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use. To opt-out of us sharing your hashed email address for Matched Ads please contact us at [privacy@wargaming.net](mailto:privacy@wargaming.net) and specify that you wish to opt out of Matched Ads.

This enables our advertisers to develop and deliver targeted advertising in the Products and on the websites of third parties, so that they can try to serve you with advertisements for products and services that are most likely to be of interest to you. Advertisers will also use this information to monitor, improve or modify their operations.

**8\. YOUR RIGHTS**

To allow you to exercise your data protection rights in a simple way we have improved the Account Management tools available [here](https://wargaming.net/personal/) and – for Console Games – [here](https://console.worldoftanks.com/accounts/management/). If you are using a demo account, you will only be able to fully control our use of your data after you create the Account [here](http://wargaming.net/) or – for Console Games – [here](https://console.worldoftanks.com/). This means that if you are using a demo version of the Account, you will only be able to fully control our use of your data after you complete the Account here. Please visit it to make choices about which direct communications you would like to receive, as well as to exercise your rights to data access, data erasure and objection to data processing. In some cases, for games developed solely by third parties and published by Wargaming on Wargaming Game Center (see section 7(18) above), you can exercise your rights directly from the third-party developer. You may contact us to assist you on how you can exercise your rights for games developed solely by third parties.

If you have linked your Account with linked services (e.g., Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Steam, Twitch etc) you may unlink your accounts at any time through the Account Management settings. Please note that unlinking your accounts will not affect any information previously shared through linking. We are not responsible for the data practices of any other parties, and we recommend that you carefully review their privacy policies and terms of use.

**8.1. OPT-OUT OF DIRECT MARKETING AND RIGHT TO OBJECT**

You can manage your subscriptions to direct marketing through our Account Management tool. Please note that even if you unsubscribe from all our personalized marketing emails, messages, in-game and web- offers, we will still send you some notifications (we often refer to them as “transactional”), e.g. to confirm purchases or changes in your Account, give warranty or security information, information about changes to the EULA, Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, as well as will show to you non-personalized marketing in-game and web offers. We will be able to stop all communications only after your Account is deleted. Also, even after you have unsubscribed from our in-game and web offers, you may still see them within the Games and on some web-sites: that would mean that such offers are shown to everyone or to a very broad audience and are not specifically directed to you.

You can opt-out of personalized advertising in mobile applications, including our mobile Games, by checking the privacy settings of your Android or iOS device and selecting “limit ad tracking” (Apple iOS) or “opt-out of interest-based ads” (Android). You can adjust your mobile push notifications in your Android or iOS device settings menu.

Where processing of your Personal Data is based on legitimate interests, you can use your right to object at any time. If you object we will no longer process your Personal Data unless there are compelling and prevailing legitimate grounds for the processing or the data are necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.

**8.2. RIGHT OF ACCESS**

You have the right to access your Personal Data that we hold about you, i.e. the right to require free of charge (i) information whether your Personal Data is retained, (ii) access to and/or (iii) duplicates of the Personal Data retained. You can use the right to access to your Personal Data through the “Data Export” tool available in the Account Management tools [here](https://wargaming.net/personal/) and – for Console Games – [here](https://console.worldoftanks.com/accounts/management/). Normally, we provide the duplicate of the Personal Data retained within 30 (thirty) days upon your request. Once the archive with the Personal Data we retain is ready, you will be able to download in it from our resources. If the request affects the rights and freedoms of others or is manifestly unfounded or excessive, we reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee (taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested) or refuse to act on the request. We also will not be able to provide you with some Personal Data that you may post or provide using our Products regardless of our request not to provide the Personal Data in this particular field, website, etc.

**8.3. RIGHT TO RECTIFICATION**

You control which nickname, email, phone number, country (only in exceptional circumstances), social networks accounts, trusted sites and payment methods we associate with your Account. If they change, please modify the data in the Personal Account directly. Please inform us if any of the Personal Data we retain about you is inaccurate.

**8.4. RIGHT TO ERASURE**

You have the right to obtain deletion by us of Personal Data concerning you by deleting your Account via our “Account Deletion” tool available in the Account Management tools [here](https://wargaming.net/personal/) and – for Console Games – [here](https://console.worldoftanks.com/accounts/management/).

As a result of deleting your Account, you will lose access to most Products, including the Account and Game-Related Information linked to the Account, subscriptions to Wargaming forums and the possibility to access other services you are using the Account for.

**Grace period.** We allow you to restore your Account during a grace period of 45 (forty-five) days from the moment you request deletion of your Account. This functionality allows you not to lose various Game-Related Information and other important information and options by mistake. During the suspension period, we will be able to finalise financial and other activities that you may have initiated before sending the Account deletion request.

**No payments after Account deletion.** As a result of deleting your Account, you will lose the possibility to make payments in the Premium Shop, including during the grace period. Should any payment be made after Account deletion due to a technical error or for any other reason, we will refund the amount paid by you and will not grant you the rights to the respective Additional Features.

**Complicated Account deletion.** In some cases, deletion of your Account, and therefore Personal Data deletion, is complicated. Namely, if you are a clan commander in the Games, it is highly likely that you will only be able to delete your Account after you have transferred the clan and placed it under the command of another user or dissolve the clan. In some cases, considering the complexity and number of the requests, the period for Personal Data erasure may be extended, but for no longer than two further months.

**Earlier Personal Data deletion.** We store most Personal Data we retain about you until you request deletion of your Account through the Account Management tools. However, certain Personal Data is deleted even while you have a valid Account. For example, we will delete:

* your Contact Data, clothes sizes, colour preferences, etc., you have provided for customisation, or for us to send you an award or arrange travel to one of our events, within 45 (forty-five) days after us sending the award to your address;
* the data about you that we have collected in the course of alpha-tests, super tests, UX tests, surveys, analysis of publicly available sentiments in social networks such as YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, at onsite events: within no longer than 45 (forty-five) days after completion of the data analysis, data aggregation and generating of the reports for our Products improvement;
* technical logs such as records of communication between Products, access logs, errors logs: normally within 45 (forty-five) days after their creation.

**Information we retain.** Upon expiry of the suspension period we will delete all your Personal Data, except for the data which are required for our compliance with the requirements of applicable laws (e.g. tax and accounting requirements) or for our detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game and EULA violations or to resolve disputes and enforce our agreements. We will also retain anonymous or de-identified information after your Account has been deleted. Information you have shared with others (e.g. through in-Games chats, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you have deleted your account or deleted the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control the data that other members/users copied out of our Products. Groups content associated with deleted accounts will show an unknown user as the source. Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g. search engine results) until they refresh their cache.

**9\. COMPLAINTS**

If you have any issues with our compliance you may contact our Data Protection Officer as set out in section 2 above. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the data protection regulator in your jurisdiction.

**10\. WE CAN CHANGE THIS POLICY**

We may change this Policy from time to time for various reasons, such as legal and regulatory changes, changes in industry practices and technological developments that need to be reflected. If the changes are material, we may provide you additional notice to your email address.
